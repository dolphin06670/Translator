中国科幻基石丛书 58 7．疯狂年代 中国， 1967 年。 “红色联合”对“四二八兵团”总部大楼的攻击已持续了两天，他 们的旗帜在大楼周围躁动地飘扬着，仿佛渴望干柴的火种。 “红色联 合”的指挥官心急如焚，他并不惧怕大楼的守卫者，那二百多名“四二 八”战士，与诞生于 1966 年初、经历过大检阅和大串联的“红色联合” 相比要稚嫩许多。他怕的是大楼中那十几个大铁炉子，里面塞满了烈性 炸药，用电雷管串联起来，他看不到它们，但能感觉到它们磁石般的存 在，开关一合，玉石俱焚，而“四二八”的那些小红卫兵们是有这个精 神力量的。比起已经在风雨中成熟了许多的第一代红卫兵，新生的造反 派们像火炭上的狼群，除了疯狂还是疯狂。 大楼顶上出现了一个娇小的身影，那个美丽的女孩子挥动着一面 “四二八”的大旗，她的出现立刻招来了一阵杂乱的枪声，射击的武器 五花八门，有陈旧的美式卡宾枪、捷克式机枪和三八大盖，也有崭新的 制式步枪和冲锋枪后者是在“八月社论”发表之后从军队中偷抢 来的连同那些梭镖和大刀等冷兵器， 构成了一部浓缩的近现代史 ……“四二八”的人在前面多次玩过这个游戏，在楼顶上站出来的人， 除了挥舞旗帜外，有时还用喇叭筒喊口号或向下撒传单，每次他们都能 在弹雨中全身而退，为自己挣到了崇高的荣誉。这次出来的女孩儿显然也 相信自己还有那样的幸运。她挥舞着战旗，挥动着自己燃烧的青春，敌 人将在这火焰中化为灰烬，理想世界明天就会在她那沸腾的热血中诞 生……她陶醉在这鲜红灿烂的梦幻中，直到被一颗步枪子弹洞穿了胸 地球往事 三体 59 膛，十五岁少女的胸膛是那么柔嫩，那颗子弹穿过后基本上没有减速， 在她身后的空中发出一声啾鸣。年轻的红卫兵同她的旗帜一起从楼顶 落下，她那轻盈的身体落得甚至比旗帜还慢，仿佛小鸟眷恋着天空。其 实，比起另外一些人来，她还是幸运的，至少是在为理想献身的壮丽激 情中死去。 这样的热点遍布整座城市，像无数并行运算的 CPU ，将“文化大革 命”联为一个整体。疯狂如同无形的洪水，将城市淹没其中，并渗透到 每一个细微的角落和缝隙。 在城市边缘的那所著名大学的操场上，一场几千人参加的批斗会已 经进行了近两个小时。在这个派别林立的年代，任何一处都有错综复 杂的对立派别在格斗。在校园中，红卫兵、文革工作组、工宣队和军宣 队，相互之间都在爆发尖锐的冲突，而每种派别的内部又时时分化出新 的对立派系，捍卫着各自不同的背景和纲领，爆发更为残酷的较量。但 这次被批斗的反动学术权威，却是任何一方均无异议的斗争目标，他们 也只能同时承受来自各方的残酷打击。 与其他的牛鬼蛇神相比，反动学术权威有他们的特点：当打击最初到 来时，他们的表现往往是高傲而顽固的，这也是他们伤亡率最高的阶 段；他们有的因不认罪而被活活打死，有的则选择了用自杀的方式来维 护自己的尊严。 从这一阶段幸存下来的人，在持续的残酷打击下渐渐麻木，这是一 种自我保护的精神外壳，使他们避免最后的崩溃。他们在批斗会上常常 进入半睡眠状态，只有一声恫吓才能使其惊醒过来，机械地重复那已说 过无数遍的认罪词；然后，他们中的一部分人便进入了第三阶段，旷日 持久的批判将鲜明的政治图像如水银般注入了他们的意识，将他们那 由知识和理性构筑的思想大厦彻底摧毁，他们真的相信自己有罪，真的 看到了自己对伟大事业构成的损害，并为此痛哭流涕，他们的忏悔往往 比那些非知识分子的牛鬼蛇神要深刻得多，也真诚得多。而对于红卫兵 中国科幻基石丛书 60 来说，进入后两个阶段的批判对象是最乏味的，只有处于第一阶段的牛 鬼蛇神才能对他们那早已过度兴奋的神经产生有效的刺激，如同斗牛士 手上的红布，但这样的对象越来越少了，在这所大学中可能只剩下一 个，他由于自己的珍稀而被留到批判大会最后出场。 叶哲泰从文革开始一直活到了现在，并且一直处于第一阶段，他不 认罪，不自杀，也不麻木。当这位物理学教授走上批判台时，他那神情分 明在说：让我背负的十字架更沉重一些吧！ 红卫兵们让他负担的东西确实很重，但不是十字架。别的批判对象 戴的高帽子都是用竹条扎的框架，而他戴的这顶却是用一指粗的钢筋 焊成的，还有他挂在胸前的那块牌子，也不是别人挂的木板，而是从实 验室的一个烤箱上拆下的铁门，上面用黑色醒目地写着他的名字，并沿 对角线画上了一个红色的大叉。 押送叶哲泰上台的红卫兵比别的批判对象多了一倍，有六人，两男 四女。两个男青年步伐稳健有力，一副成熟的青年布尔什维克形象，他 们都是物理系理论物理专业大四年级的，叶哲泰曾是他们的老师；那四 名女孩子要年轻得多，都是大学附中的初二学生，这些穿着军装扎着武 装带的小战士挟带着逼人的青春活力，像四团绿色的火焰包围着叶哲 泰。叶哲泰的出现使下面的人群兴奋起来，刚才已有些乏力的口号声又 像新一轮海潮般重新高昂起来，淹没了一切。 耐心地等口号声平息下去后，台上两名男红卫兵中的一人转向批 判对象： “叶哲泰，你精通各种力学，应该看到自己正在抗拒的这股伟 大的合力是多么强大，顽固下去是死路一条！今天继续上次大会的议 程，废话就不多说了。老实回答下面的问题：在六二至六五届的基础课 中，你是不是擅自加入了大量的相对论内容？ ！ ” “相对论已经成为物理学的古典理论，基础课怎么能不涉及它 呢？”叶哲泰回答说。 “你胡说！ ”旁边的一名女红卫兵厉声说， “爱因斯坦是反动的学 术权威，他有奶便是娘，跑去为美帝国主义造原子弹！要建立起革命的 地球往事 三体 61 科学，就要打倒以相对论为代表的资产阶级理论黑旗！ ” 叶哲泰沉默着，他在忍受着头上铁高帽和胸前铁板带来的痛苦，不 值得回应的问题就沉默了。在他身后，他的学生也微微皱了一下眉头。 说话的女孩儿是这四个中学红卫兵中天资最聪颖的一个，并且显然有 备而来，刚才上台前还看到她在背批判稿，但要对付叶哲泰，仅凭她那 几句口号是不行的。他们决定亮出今天为老师准备的新武器，其中的一 人对台下挥了一下手。 叶哲泰的妻子，同系的物理学教授绍琳从台下的前排站起来，走上 台。她身穿一件很不合体的草绿色衣服，显然想与红卫兵的色彩拉近距 离，但熟悉绍琳的人联想到以前常穿精致旗袍讲课的她，总觉得别扭。 “叶哲泰！ ”绍琳指着丈夫喝道，她显然不习惯于这种场合，尽量拔 高自己的声音， 却连其中的颤抖也放大了， “你没有想到我会站出来揭 发你，批判你吧！？是的，我以前受你欺骗，你用自己那反动的世界观和 科学观蒙蔽了我！现在我醒悟了，在革命小将的帮助下，我要站到革命 的一边，人民的一边！ ”她转向台下， “同志们、革命小将们、革命的教职 员工们，我们应该认清爱因斯坦相对论的反动本质，这种本质，广义相 对论体现得最清楚：它提出的静态宇宙模型，否定了物质的运动本性， 是反辩证法的！它认为宇宙有限，更是彻头彻尾的反动唯心主义……” 听着妻子滔滔不绝的演讲，叶哲泰苦笑了一下。琳，我蒙蔽了你？其 实你在我心中倒一直是个谜。 一次，我对你父亲称赞你那过人的天资他很幸运，去得早，躲 过了这场灾难老人家摇摇头，说我女儿不可能在学术上有什么建 树；接着，他说出了对我后半生很重要的一句话：琳琳太聪明了，可是搞 基础理论，不笨不行啊。 以后的许多年里，我不断悟出这话的深意。琳，你真的太聪明了，早 在几年前，你就嗅出了知识界的政治风向，做出了一些超前的举动，比 如你在教学中，把大部分物理定律和参数都改了名字，欧姆定律改叫电 阻定律，麦克斯韦方程改名成电磁方程，普朗克常数叫成了量子常数 中国科幻基石丛书 62 ……你对学生们解释说：所有的科学成果都是广大劳动人民智慧的结 晶，那些资产阶级学术权威不过是窃取了这些智慧。但即使这样，你仍 然没有被“革命主流”所接纳，看看现在的你，衣袖上没有“革命教职 员工”都戴着的红袖章；你两手空空地上来，连一本语录都没资格拿 ……谁让你出生在旧中国那样一个显赫的家庭，你父母又都是那么著 名的学者。 说起爱因斯坦，你比我有更多的东西需要交待。 1922 年冬天，爱因 斯坦到上海访问，你父亲因德语很好被安排为接待陪同者之一。你多次 告诉我，父亲是在爱因斯坦的亲自教诲下走上物理学之路的，而你选择 物理专业又是受了父亲的影响，所以爱翁也可以看作你的间接导师，你 为此感到无比的自豪和幸福。 后来我知道，父亲对你讲了善意的谎言，他与爱因斯坦只有过一次 短得不能再短的交流。 那是 1922 年11月13日上午，他陪爱因斯坦到南京路散步，同行的 好像还有上海大学校长于右任、 《大公报》经理曹谷冰等人，经过一 个路基维修点，爱因斯坦在一名砸石子的小工身旁停下，默默看着这个 在寒风中衣衫破烂、手脸污黑的男孩子，问你父亲：他一天挣多少钱？问 过小工后，你父亲回答：五分。这就是他与改变世界的科学大师唯一的 一次交流，没有物理学，没有相对论，只有冰冷的现实。据你父亲说，爱 因斯坦听到他的回答后又默默地站在那里好一会儿，看着小工麻木的 劳作，手里的烟斗都灭了也没有吸一口。你父亲在回忆这件事后，对我 发出这样的感叹：在中国，任何超脱飞扬的思想都会砰然坠地的，现实 的引力太沉重了。 “低下头！ ”一名男红卫兵大声命令。这也许是自己的学生对老师 一丝残存的同情，被批斗者都要低头，但叶哲泰要这样，那顶沉重的铁 高帽就会掉下去，以后只要他一直低着头，就没有理由再给他戴上。但 叶哲泰仍昂着头，用瘦弱的脖颈支撑着那束沉重的钢铁。 “低头！你个反动顽固分子！ ！”旁边一名女红卫兵解下腰间的皮带 地球往事 三体 63 朝叶哲泰挥去，黄铜带扣正打在他脑门上，在那里精确地留下了带扣的 形状，但很快又被淤血模糊成黑紫的一团。他摇晃了一下，又站稳了。 一名男红卫兵质问叶哲泰： “在量子力学的教学中，你也散布过大 量的反动言论！ ”说完对绍琳点点头，示意她继续。 绍琳迫不及待地要继续下去了，她必须不停顿地说下去，以维持自 己那摇摇欲坠的精神免于彻底垮掉。 “叶哲泰，这一点你是无法抵赖 的！你多次向学生散布反动的哥本哈根解释！ ” “这毕竟是目前公认的最符合实验结果的解释。 ”叶哲泰说，在受 到如此重击后，他的口气还如此从容，这让绍琳很吃惊，也很恐惧。 “这个解释认为，是外部的观察导致了量子波函数的坍缩，这是反 动唯心论的另一种表现形式，而且是一种最猖狂的表现！ ” “是哲学指引实验还是实验指引哲学？”叶哲泰问道，他这突然的 反击令批判者们一时不知所措。 “当然是正确的马克思主义哲学指引科学实验！ ”一名男红卫兵 说。 “这等于说正确的哲学是从天上掉下来的，这反对实践出真知，恰恰 是违背马克思主义对自然界的认知原则的。 ” 绍琳和两名大学红卫兵无言以对，与中学和社会上的红卫兵不同， 他们不可能一点儿道理也不讲。但来自附中的四位小将自有她们“无 坚不摧”的革命方式，刚才动手的那个女孩儿又狠抽了叶哲泰一皮带， 另外三个女孩子也都分别抡起皮带抽了一下，当同伴革命时，她们必须 表现得更革命，至少要同样革命。两名男红卫兵没有过问，他们要是现 在管这事，也有不革命的嫌疑。 “你还在教学中散布宇宙大爆炸理论，这是所有科学理论中最反 动的一个！ ”一名男红卫兵试图转移话题。 “也许以后这个理论会被推翻，但本世纪的两大宇宙学发现：哈勃 红移和 3K宇宙背景辐射，使大爆炸学说成为目前为止最可信的宇宙起 源理论。 ” 中国科幻基石丛书 64 “胡说！ ”绍琳大叫起来，又接着滔滔不绝地讲起了宇宙大爆炸，自 然不忘深刻地剖析其反动本质。但这理论的超级新奇吸引了四个小女 孩儿中最聪明的那一个，她不由自主地问道： “连时间都是从那个奇点开始的！ ？那奇点以前有什么？ ” “什么都没有。 ”叶哲泰说，像回答任何一个小女孩儿的问题那样， 他转头慈祥地看着她，铁高帽和已受的重伤，使他这动作很艰难。 “什么……都没有？ ！反动！反动透顶！ ！”那女孩儿惊恐万状地大 叫起来，她不知所措地转向绍琳寻求帮助，立刻得到了回应。 “这给上帝的存在留下了位置。 ”绍琳对女孩儿点点头提示说。 小红卫兵那茫然的思路立刻找到了立脚点，她举起紧握皮带的手 指着叶哲泰， “你，是想说有上帝？ ！ ” “我不知道。 ” “你说什么！ ” “我是说不知道，如果上帝是指宇宙之外的超意识的话，我不知道 它是不是存在；正反两方面，科学都没给出确实的证据。 ”其实，在这噩 梦般的时刻，叶哲泰已倾向于相信它不存在了。 这句大逆不道的话在整个会场引起了骚动，在台上一名红卫兵的 带领下，又爆发了一波波的口号声。 “打倒反动学术权威叶哲泰！ ！ ” “打倒一切反动学术权威！ ！ ” “打倒一切反动学说！ ！ ” …… “上帝是不存在的，一切宗教，都是统治阶级编造出来的麻痹人民 的精神工具！ ”口号平息后，那个小女孩儿大声说。 “这种看法是片面的。 ”叶哲泰平静地说。 恼羞成怒的小红卫兵立刻做出了判断，对于眼前这个危险的敌人， 一切语言都无意义了。她抡起皮带冲上去，她的三个小同志立刻跟上， 叶哲泰的个子很高，这四个十四岁的女孩儿只能朝上抡皮带才能打到 地球往事 三体 65 他那不肯低下的头，在开始的几下打击后，他头上能起一定保护作用的 铁高帽被打掉了，接下来带铜扣的宽皮带如雨点般打在他的头上和身 上他终于倒下了，这鼓舞了小红卫兵们，她们更加投入地继续着这 “崇高”的战斗，她们在为信念而战，为理想而战，她们为历史给予自己 的光辉使命所陶醉，为自己的英勇而自豪…… “最高指示：要文斗不要武斗！ ”叶哲泰的两名学生终于下定了决 心，喊出了这句话，两人同时冲过去，拉开了已处于半疯狂状态的四个 小女孩儿。 但已经晚了，物理学家静静地躺在地上，半睁的双眼看着从他的头 颅上流出的血迹，疯狂的会场瞬间陷入了一片死寂，那条血迹是唯一在 动的东西，它像一条红蛇缓慢地蜿蜒爬行着，到达台沿后一滴滴地滴在 下面一个空箱子上，发出有节奏的“哒哒”声，像渐行渐远的脚步。 一阵怪笑声打破了寂静，这声音是精神已彻底崩溃的绍琳发出的， 听起来十分恐怖。人们开始离去，最后发展成一场大溃逃，每个人都想 尽快逃离这个地方。会场很快空了下来，只剩下一个姑娘站在台下。 她是叶哲泰的女儿叶文洁。 当那四个女孩儿施暴夺去父亲生命时，她曾想冲上台去，但身边的 两名老校工死死抓住她，并在耳边低声告诉她别连自己的命也不要了， 当时会场已经处于彻底的癫狂，她的出现只会引出更多的暴徒。她曾声 嘶力竭地哭叫，但声音淹没在会场上疯狂的口号和助威声中，当一切寂 静下来时，她自己也发不出任何声音了，只是凝视台上父亲已没有生命 的躯体，那没有哭出和喊出的东西在她的血液中弥漫、溶解，将伴她一 生。 人群散去后，她站在那里，身体和四肢仍保持着老校工抓着她时的 姿态，一动不动，像石化了一般。过了好久，她才将悬空的手臂放下来， 缓缓起身走上台，坐在父亲的遗体边，握起他的一只已凉下来的手，两 眼失神地看着远方。当遗体要被抬走时，叶文洁从衣袋中拿出一样东西 放到父亲的那只手中，那是父亲的烟斗。 中国科幻基石丛书 66 文洁默默地离开了已经空无一人一片狼藉的操场，走上回家的路。 当她走到教工宿舍楼下时， 听到了从二楼自家窗口传出的一阵阵痴笑声， 这声音是那个她曾叫做妈妈的女人发出的。文洁默默地转身走去，任双 脚将她带向别处。,"1 T h e M a d n e s s Y e a r s China, 1967 The Red Union had been attack ing the headquarters of the April T wenty- eighth Brigade for two days. Th eir red flags fluttered restlessly around the brigade building like flames yearning for firewood. The Red Union commander was anxious, though not because of the defenders he faced. The more than two hundred Red Guards of the April T wenty-eighth Brigade were mere greenhorns compared with the veteran Red Guards of t he Red Union, which was formed at the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in early 1966. The Red Unio n had been tempered by the tumultuous ex perience of revolutionary tours around the country and seeing Chairman Mao in the great rallies in T iananmen Square. But the commander was afraid of the dozen or so iron stoves inside the building, filled with explosives and connected to each other by electric detonators. He couldn’ t see them , but he could feel their presence like iron sensing the pull of a nearby magnet. If a defender flipped the switch, revolutionaries a nd counter -revo lutionaries alike would all die in one giant ball of fire. And the young Red Guards of the April T wenty-eighth Brigade were indeed capable of such madness. Compared with the weathered men and women of the fi rst generation of Red Guards, the new rebels were a pack of wolves on hot coals, crazier than crazy . The slen der figure of a beautiful young girl emer ged at the to p of the building, waving the giant red b anner of the April T wenty-eighth Brigade.Her appearance was greeted imm ediately by a cacophony of gu nshots. The weapons attacking her were a diverse mix: antiques such as American carbines, Czech-style machine guns, Japanese T ype-38 ri fles; newer weapons such as standard-issue People’ s Liberation Army rifles and submachine gun s, stolen from the PLA after the publication of the “August Editorial”1; a nd even a fe w Chinese dadao swords and spears. T ogether , they formed a condensed version of modern history . Numerous mem bers of the Apri l T wenty-eighth Brigade had engaged in similar d isplays before. They’d stand on top of the building, w ave a flag, shout slogans through megaphon es, and scatter flyers at the attackers below . Every ti me, the courageous man or woman had been able to re treat safely from the hailstorm of bullets and earn glory for their valor . The new girl cle arly thought she’d be just as lucky . She waved t he battle banner a s though brandishing her burning youth, trusting that the enemy would b e burnt to ashes in the revolutionary flames, imagining t hat an ideal world w ould be born tomorrow from the ardor and zeal coursing through her blood.… She was intoxicat ed by her brilliant, crimson dream until a bullet pierced her chest. Her fifteen-year -old body was so soft that the bullet hardly slowed down as it passed thro ugh it and whi stled in the air behind her . The young Red Guard tumbled down along wit h her flag, her light form descending even more slo wly tha n the piece of red fabric, like a little bird unwilling to leave the sky . The Red Union warriors shouted in joy . A few rushed to the foot of the building, tore away the battle b anner of the April T wenty-eighth Brigade, and seiz ed the slender , lifeless body . They raised their trophy overhead and flaunted it for a while before to ssing it toward the top of the metal gate of the compound. Most of the gate’ s metal bars, capped with sharp tips, had been pulled down at the beg inning of the fa ctional civil wars to be used as spears, but two still remained. As their shar p tips caught the girl, life seemed to return momentarily to her body . The Red Guards backed up som e distance and began to use the impaled body fo r tar get practice. For he r , the dense storm of bullets was now no dif ferent from a gentle rain, as she could no longer feel anything. From timeto ti me, her vinelike arms jerked across her body softly , as thou gh she were flicking of f drops of rain. And then half o f her young he ad was blown away , and only a single, beautiful eye remained to stare at the blue sky of 1967. There was no pain in that gaze, only solidified devotion and yearning. And yet , compa red to some oth ers, she was fortunate. At least she died in the throes of passionately sacrificing herself for an ideal. * * * Battles l ike this one raged across Beijing like a multitude of CP Us working in p arallel, their combined ou tput, the Cultural Revolution. A flood of madness drowned the city and seeped into every nook and cranny . At the edge of the city , on the exercise grounds of T singhua University , a mass “struggl e session” attended by thousands had been g oing on for nearly tw o hour s. This was a public rally intended to humiliat e and break down the enemies of the revolution through verbal and physical abuse until they confessed to their crimes before the crowd. As the revolutionaries had splintered into numerous factions, opposing forces ev erywhere engaged in complex maneuvers and contests . W ithin the university , inten se conflicts erupted between the Red Guards, the Cultural Revolution W orking Group, the W orkers’ Propaganda T eam, and the Military Propaga nda T eam. And each faction divided into new r ebel groups from time to t ime, each based on dif ferent backgrounds and agendas, leading to even more ruthless fighting. But for this mass struggle session, the victims were the reactionary bour geois acade mic authorities. These were the enemies of every faction, and they had no choice but to endure cruel attacks from every side. Compared to other “Monsters and Demons,”2 reactionary academic authorities were special: During the earliest struggle sessions, they had been both arrogant and stubborn. Tha t was also the stage in which th ey had died in the lar gest numbers. Over a period of forty days, in Beijing alone, more than seventeen hundred victims of struggle sessions were beat en to death. Many ot hers picked an easier path to avoid the madness: Lao Sh e, W u Han, Jian Boz an, Fu Lei, Zhao Jiuzhang, Y i Qun, W en Jie, Hai Mo , and other once-respected intellectuals had all chosen to end their lives.3Those w ho survived that initial period gradually became numb as the ruthless struggle sessions continued. The protective mental shell helped them av oid total breakdown. They often seemed to be half asleep during the sessions and would only startle awake when someone screamed in their faces to make them mechanically recite their confessions, already repeated countless times. Then, s ome of them entered a third stage. The constant, un ceasing struggle sessions injected vivid political images into their consciousness like mer cury , until their minds, erected upon knowledge and rationality , collapsed under the assault. They began to really believe tha t they were guilty , to see how they had harmed the great cause of the revolution. They cried, and their repentance was far deeper and more sincere than that of those Monsters and Demons who were not intellectuals. For the Red Gu ards, heaping abuse upon victims in those tw o latter mental stages was utterly boring. Only those Monsters and Demons who were stil l in the initial stage cou ld give their overstimulated brains the thrill they craved, like the red cape of the matador . But such desirable victims had grown scarce. In T singhua there was probably only one left. Because he was so rare, he was reserved for the very end of the struggle session. Y e Zhetai had su rvived the Cultural Revolution so far , but he r emained in th e fi rst mental stage. He refused to repent, to kill himself, o r to become numb. W hen th is physics professor walked onto the stage in front of the crowd, his expression clearly said: Let the cr oss I bear be even heavier . The Red Guards did indeed ha ve him carry a burden, but it w asn’ t a cross. O ther vic tims wore tall h ats made from bamboo frames, but his was welded from thick steel bars. And the plaque he wore around his neck wasn’ t w ooden, like the others, but an iron door taken from a laboratory oven. H is name was written on the door in striking black characters, and two red diagonals were drawn across them in a lar ge X. T wice the number of Red Gua rds used for other victims esco rted Y e onto the stage: two men and four women. The two young men strode with confidence and purpose, the ver y image of mature Bolshevik y ouths. They were bo th fourth -year students4 maj oring in theoretical physics, and Y e was their professor . The women, rea lly girls, were much younger , second-year students from the junior high sc hool attached to the university .5 Dressed inmilitary uniforms and equipped with bandoliers, they exuded youthful vigor and surrounded Y e Zhetai like four green flames. His appe arance excited the crowd. The shouting of slogans, which had slackened a bit, now picked up with renewed force and drowned out everything else like a resur gent tide. After w aiting p atiently for the noise to subside, one of the m ale Red Guards turned to the victim. “Y e Zhetai, you are an expert in mechanics. Y ou should see how strong the great unified force you’re resisting is. T o remain s o stubb orn will lead on ly to your death! T oday , we will continue the agenda from the last time. There’ s no need to waste words. Answer the following questi on without your typical deceit: Between the years of 1962 and 1965, did you not decide on your own to add relativity to the intro physics course?” “Relativity is part of the fundam ental theories of physics,” Y e answered. “How can a basic survey course not teach it?” “Y ou lie!” a fe male Red Guard by his side shouted. “Einstein is a reactionary academic authority . He would serve any master who dangled money i n front of him. He ev en went to the American Impe rialists and helped them build the atom bom b! T o develop a revolutionary science, we must overthrow the black banne r of capitalism represented by the theory of relativity!” Y e r emained silent. Enduring the pain brought by the heavy iron hat and the iron plaque hanging from his neck, he had no ener gy to answer questions that were not worth answering. Behind him, one of his students also frowned. The girl who had spoken was the most intelligent of the four female Red Guards, and she was clearly prepared, as she had been seen memorizing the struggle session script before coming onstage. But against someone like Y e Zhetai, a few slogans like th at were insuf ficient. The Red Guards de cided to bring out the new weapon they had prepared against their teacher . One of them waved to someone of fstage. Y e’ s wif e, physi cs professor Shao Lin, stood up from the crowd’ s front row . She walked onto the stage dre ssed in an ill-fitting green outfit, clearly intended to imitate the military uniform of the Red Guards. Those who knew he r remem bered that she had often taught class in an ele gant qipao, and her current appearance felt forced and awkward.“Y e Zhetai!” She was clearly u nused to such theater , and though she tried to make her voice louder , the ef fort magnified the tremors in it. “Y ou didn’ t think I w ould stand up and expose you, criticize you? Y es, in the past, I was foole d by you. Y ou covered my eyes with your react ionary view of the world and science! But n ow I am awake and alert. W ith the help of the revolutionary youths, I want to stand on the side of the revolution, the side of the people!” She turned to face the crowd. “Comrades, revolutionary youths, revolutionary faculty and staf f, we must clearly understand the reactionary nature of Einstein’ s theory of r elativity . This is most apparent in general relativity: Its static model of th e universe negates the dynamic nature of matter . It is anti-dialectical! It treats the universe as limited , which is absolutely a form of reactionary idealism.…” As he listened to his wife’ s lectu re, Y e allowed himself a wry smile. Lin, I fooled you? Indeed, in my hear t you’ve always been a mystery . One time, I praised your genius to your f atherhe’ s lucky to have died early and escaped this catastr opheand he shook his head, telling me that he did not think you would ever achieve much academically . What he said next turned out to be so important to the second half of my life: “Lin Lin is too smart. T o work in fundamental theory , one must be stupid.” In la ter years, I began to understand his wor ds mor e and mor e. Lin, you truly ar e too sma rt. Even a few years ago, you could feel the pol itical winds shifting in academia and pr epar ed yourself. For example, when you taught, you cha nged the names of man y physical laws and constants: Ohm’ s law you called r esistance law , Maxwell’ s equations you called electr omagnetic equations, Planck’ s constant you called the quantum constant.… Y ou explained to your students that a ll scientific accomplishments r esulted fr om the wis dom of the working masses, and those capitalist academic authorities only stole these fruits and put their names on them. But even so, you couldn’ t be accepted by the r evolutionary mai nstr eam. Look at you now: Y ou’r e not allowed to wear the r ed armb and of the “r evolutionary faculty and staff”; you had to come up her e empty-handed, without the status to carry a Litt le Red Book.… Y ou can’ t over co me the fault of b eing born to a pr ominent family in pr e-r evolutionary China and of having such famous scholars as par ents.But you actually have mor e to confess about Einstein than I do. In the winter o f 1922, Einstein visited Shanghai. Because your father spoke fluent German, he was asked to accompany Einstein on his tour . Y ou told me many times that your father went into physics because of Einstein’ s encouragement, and you chose physics because of your father ’ s influence. So, i n a way , Ein stein can be sa id to have indir ectly been your teacher . And you once felt so pr oud and lucky to have such a connection. Later , I found out that your father had told you a white lie. He and Einstein had only one very brief conversation. The morning of November 13, 1922 , he accompanied Eins tein on a walk along Nanjing Road. Others who went on the walk included Y u Y our en, pr esident of Shangha i University , and Cao Gubing , general manager of the newspaper T a Kung Pao. When they passed a m aintenance site in the r oad bed, Einstein stopped next to a worker w ho was smashing stones and silently observed this bo y with torn clothes a nd dirty face and hands. He asked your father how m uch the boy earned each day . After asking the boy , he told Einstein: five cents. This was the only time he spoke with the gr eat scientist who cha nged the world. Ther e was no discussion of physics, of r elativity , only cold, harsh r eality . A ccor ding to your father , Einstein stood ther e for a long time after hearing the answer , watching the boy’ s mechanical movements, not even bothering to smoke his pipe as the embers went out. After your father r ecounted this memory to me, he sighed and said, “In China, any idea that dar ed to take flight would only crash back to the gr ound. The gravity of r eality is too str ong.” “Lower your head!” one of the male Red Guards shouted. T his may actually have been a gesture of mercy from his former student. All victims being str uggled against were supposed to lower their heads. If Y e did lower his head , the tall, heavy iron h at would fall of f, and if he ke pt his head lowered, there would be no reaso n to put it back on him. But Y e refused and held his head high, supporting the heavy weight with his thin neck. “Lower your head, you stubbo rn reactionary!” One of the g irl Red Guards took of f her belt and sw ung it at Y e. The copper belt buckle struck his f orehead and left a clear imp ression that was quickly blurred by oozing blood. H e swayed unsteadily for a few moments, then stood straight and firm again.One of the m ale Red Guards said, “When you taught q uantum mechanics, you also mixed in many reactionary ideas.” Then he nodded at Shao Lin, indicating that she should continue. Shao wa s happy to oblige. She had to keep on talking, otherwise her fragile m ind, already hanging on only by a thin thread, would collapse completely . “Y e Zhetai, you cannot deny this char ge! Y ou have often lectured students on the reactionary Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.” “It is, after all, the explanation recognized to be most in line with experimental results.” His tone, so calm and collected, surprised and frightened Shao Lin. “This ex planation posits that external observation leads to the collapse of th e quantum wave function. This is another expression of reactionary idealism, and it’ s indeed the most brazen expression.” “Should philosophy guide exp eriments, or should experimen ts guide philosophy?” Y e’ s sudden counterattack shocked those leading the struggle session. For a moment they did not know what to do. “Of cou rse it should be the correct philosophy of Marxism that guides scientific experiments!” one of the male Red Guards finally said. “Then that’ s equivalent to saying that the correct philosophy fal ls out of the sky . This is against the idea that the truth emer ges from exp erience. It’ s counter to the principles of how Marxism seeks to understand nature.” Shao Lin and the two college student Red Guards had no answer for this. Unlike the Red Guards who were still in junior high school, they couldn’ t completely ignore logic. But the four junior high girls ha d their own revolutionary methods that they believed were invincible. The girl who had hit Y e before took out her belt and whipped Y e again. The other three girls also took of f their belts to strike at Y e. W ith their companion displaying such revolutionary fervor , they had to display even more, or at least the same amount. The two male Red Guards didn’ t interfere. If they tried to intervene now , they would be suspected of being insuf ficiently revolutionary . “Y ou als o taugh t the big bang theory . This is the most reactionary of all scientific theorie s.” One of the male Red Guards spoke up, trying to change the subject.“Maybe in the future this the ory will be disproven. But tw o great cosmological discoveries of this centuryHubble’ s law , and observation of the cosmic microwave backgr oundshow that the big bang theory is currently the most plausible explanation for the origin of the universe.” “Lies!” Shao Lin shouted. Then she began a long lecture about the big bang theory , remembering to s plice in insightful critiques of the theory’ s extremely reactionary nature. B ut the freshness of the theory attracted the most int elligent of the four girl s, who couldn’ t help but ask, “T ime began with the singularity? So what was there before the singularity?” “Nothing,” Y e said, the way he would answer a question fr om any curious young person. He turned to look at the girl kindly . W ith his injuries and the tall iron hat, the motion was very dif ficult. “No … nothing? That’ s reactionary! Completely reactionary!” the frightened girl shouted. She turned to Shao Lin, who gladly came to her aid. “The the ory leaves open a plac e to be filled by God.” Shao no dded at the girl. The young Red Guard, confuse d by these new thoughts, final ly found her footing. She raised her han d, still holding the belt, and pointed at Y e. “Y ou: you’re trying to say that God exists?” “I don’ t know .” “What?” “I’m saying I don’ t know . If by ‘God’ you mean some kind of superconsciousness outside the universe, I don’ t know if it exists or not. Science has given no evidence either way .” Actually , in this nightmarish moment, Y e was leaning toward believing that God did not exist. This extremely reactionary state ment caused a commotion in the crowd. Led by one of the Red Guards on stage, another tide of slogan-shouting exploded. “Down with reactionary academic authority Y e Zhetai!” “Down with all reactionary academic authorities!” “Down with all reactionary doctrines!” Once th e slogan s died down, th e girl shouted, “God does not exist. All religions are tools concocted by the ruling class to paralyze the spirit of the people!” “That is a very one-sided view ,” Y e said calmly .The you ng Red Guard, embarrassed and angry , reached the co nclusion that, aga inst this dangerous enemy , all talk was useless. She picked up her belt and rushed at Y e, and her three companions followed. Y e was tall, and the four fourteen-year -olds had to swing their belts upward to reach his head, still held high. After a few strikes, the tall iron hat, which had protected him a little, fell of f. The continuing barrage of strikes by the metal buckles finally made him fall down. The young Red Guards, encoura ged by their success, became ev en more devoted to this glorious struggle. They were fighting for faith, for ideals. They we re intoxicated by the br ight light cast on them by history , proud of their own bravery .… Y e’ s two students had finally ha d enough. “The chairman instructed us to ‘rely on eloq uence rather than violence’!” They rushed over and pulled the four semicrazed girls of f Y e. But it was alrea dy too late. The physicist lay quietly on the gro und, his eyes still open a s blood oozed from his head. The frenzied crowd sank into silence. The only thing that moved was a thin stream of blood. Like a red snake, it slowly meandered acro ss the stage, reached the edge, and dripped onto a chest below . The rhythm ic sound made by the blood drops was like the steps of someone walking away . A cackling laugh broke the silence. The sound came from Shao Lin, whose mind had finally broken. The laughter frightened the atte ndees, who began to leave the struggle sessi on, first in trickles, and then in a flood. The exercise grounds soon emptied, leaving only one young woman below the stage. She was Y e W enjie, Y e Zhetai’ s daughter . As the four girls were taking he r father ’ s life, she had tried to rush onto the stage. But two old university janitors held her down and whispered into her ear that she would lose he r own life if she went. The mass struggle session h ad turn ed into a scene of madness, and her appearance would only incite m ore violence. She had screamed and screamed, but sh e had been drowned out by the frenzied waves of slogans and cheers. When it was finally quiet again, she was no longer capable of making any sou nd. She stared at her father ’ s lifeless body , and the thoughts she could no t voice dissolved into her blood, where they would stay with her for the rest of her life. After the crowd dispersed, she remained like a stonestatue, her body and limbs in th e positions they were in when the two old janitors had held her back. After a long tim e, she finally let her arms down, walked slowly onto the stage, sat next to her father ’ s body , and held one of his already-cold hands, her e yes staring emptily into the distance. When they finally came to carry away th e body , she took some thing from her pocket and put it into her father ’ s hand: his pipe. W enjie q uietly l eft the exercise g rounds, empty save for the tras h left by the crow d, and headed home. When she reached the foot of the faculty housing apartment building, she heard peals of crazy laughter coming out of the second-floor window of her home. That was the woman she had once called mother . W enjie turned around, not caring where her feet would carry her . Finally , she found herself at the door of Professor Ruan W en. Throughout the four years of W enjie’ s college life, Professor Ru an had been her advisor and her closest friend. During the two years after that, when W enjie had been a graduate stu dent in the Astrophysics Department, and through the subsequent chaos of the Cultural Revolution, Professor Ruan remained her closest confidante, other than her father . Ruan had studied at Cambridge University , and her home had once fascinated W enjie: refined books, paintings, and records brough t back from Europe; a piano; a set of European-style pipes arranged on a delicate wooden stand, some made from Mediterranean briar , some from T urkish meerschaum. Each of them seemed suf fused with the wisdom of the man who had once held the bowl in his hand or clamped the stem between his teeth, deep in thought, though R uan had never mentioned the m an’ s name. The pipe that had belonged to W enjie’ s father had in fact been a gift from Ruan. This elegant, warm home had once been a safe harbor for W enjie when she needed to escape the storms of the lar ger world, but that was before Ruan’ s home had been searched and her possessions seized by the Red Guards. Like W enjie’ s father , Ruan had suf fered greatly during the Cultural Revolution. During her struggle sessions, the Red Guards had hung a pair of high heels around her neck a nd streaked her face with lipst ick to show how she had lived the corrupt lifestyle of a capitalist.W enjie pushed open the door to Ruan’ s home, and she saw that the chaos left by th e Red Guards had been cleaned up: The torn o il paintings had been glued back together and rehung on the walls; the toppled piano had been set upright and wiped clean, though it was broken and could no longer b e played ; the few books left behind had been put back neatly on the shelf.… Ruan wa s sitting on the chair before her desk, her eyes closed. W enjie stood next to Ruan and gently caressed her professor ’ s forehead, face, and handsall cold. W enjie had noticed the empty sleeping pill b ottle on the desk as soon as she came in. She stood there for a while, silent. Then she turned and walked away . She could no longer feel grief. She was now like a Geiger counter that had been su bjected to too much ra diation, no longer capable of giving any reaction, noiselessly displaying a reading of zero. But as she was about to leave Ruan’ s home, W enjie turned around for a final look. She noticed that Professor Ruan had put on makeup. She was wearing a light coat of lipstick and a pair of high heels."
地球往事 三体 67 8．寂静的春天 两年以后，大兴安岭。 “顺山倒咧” 随着这声嘹亮的号子，一棵如巴特农神庙的巨柱般高大的落叶松 轰然倒下，叶文洁感到大地抖动了一下。她拿起斧头和短锯，开始去除 巨大的树身上的枝丫。每到这时，她总觉得自己是在为一个巨人整理遗 体。她甚至常常有这样的想象：这巨人就是自己的父亲。两年前那个凄 惨的夜晚，她在太平间为父亲整理遗容时的感觉就在这时重现。巨松上 那绽开的树皮，似乎就是父亲躯体上累累的伤痕。 内蒙古生产建设兵团的六个师四十一个团十多万人就分布在这辽 阔的森林和草原之间。刚从城市来到这陌生的世界时，很多兵团知青都 怀着一个浪漫的期望：当苏修帝国主义的坦克集群越过中蒙边境时，他 们将飞快地武装起来，用自己的血肉构成共和国的第一道屏障。事实 上，这也确实是兵团组建时的战略考虑之一。但他们渴望的战争就像草 原天边那跑死马的远山，清晰可见，但到不了眼前，于是他们只有垦荒、 放牧和砍伐。这些曾在“大串联”中燃烧青春的年轻人很快发现，与这 广阔天地相比，内地最大的城市不过是个羊圈；在这寒冷无际的草原和 森林间，燃烧是无意义的，一腔热血喷出来，比一堆牛粪凉得更快，还不 如后者有使用价值。但燃烧是他们的命运，他们是燃烧的一代。于是，在 他们的油锯和电锯下，大片的林海化为荒山秃岭；在他们的拖拉机和康 拜因（联合收割机）下，大片的草原被犁成粮田，然后变成沙漠。 叶文洁看到的砍伐只能用疯狂来形容，高大挺拔的兴安岭落叶松、 中国科幻基石丛书 68 四季长青的樟子松、亭亭玉立的白桦、耸入云天的山杨、西伯利亚冷杉， 以及黑桦、 柞树、 山榆、 水曲柳、 钻天柳、 蒙古栎，见什么伐什么，几百把 油锯如同一群钢铁蝗虫，她的连队所过之处，只剩下一片树桩。 整理好的落叶松就要被履带拖拉机拖走了，在树干另一头，叶文洁 轻轻抚摸了一下那崭新的锯断面，她常常下意识地这么做，总觉得那是 一处巨大的伤口，似乎能感到大树的剧痛。她突然看到，在不远处树桩 的锯断面上，也有一只在轻轻抚摸的手，那手传达出的心灵的颤抖，与 她产生了共振。那手虽然很白皙，但能够看出是属于男性的。叶文洁抬 头，看到抚摸树桩的人是白沐霖，一个戴眼镜的瘦弱青年，他是兵团 《大生产报》的记者，前天刚到连队来采访。叶文洁看过他写的文章，文 笔很好，其中有一种与这个粗放环境很不协调的纤细和敏感，令她很难 忘。 “马钢，你过来。 ”白沐霖对不远处一个小伙子喊道，那人壮得像这 棵刚被他伐倒的落叶松。他走过来，白记者问道： “你知道这棵树多大 年纪了？ ” “数数呗。 ”马钢指指树桩上的年轮说。 “我数了，三百三十多岁呢。你锯倒它用了多长时间？ ” “不到十分钟吧，告诉你，我是连里最快的油锯手，我到哪个班，流 动红旗就跟我到那儿。 ”马钢看上去很兴奋，让白记者注意到的人都这 样，能在《大生产报》的通讯报道上露一下脸也是很光荣的事。 “三百多年，十几代人啊，它发芽时还是明朝呢，这漫长的岁月里， 它经历过多少风雨，见过多少事。可你几分钟就把它锯倒了，你真没感 觉到什么？ ” “你想让我感觉到什么呢？”马钢愣了一下， “不就一棵树嘛，这里 最不缺的就是树，比它岁数长的老松多的是。 ” “忙你的去吧。 ”白沐霖摇摇头，坐在树桩子上轻轻叹息了一声。 马钢也摇摇头，记者没有报道他的兴趣，令他很失望。 “知识分子 毛病就是多。 ”他说的时候还瞟了一眼不远处的叶文洁，他的话显然也 地球往事 三体 69 包括了她。 大树被拖走了，地面上的石块和树桩划开了树皮，使它巨大的身躯 皮开肉绽。它原来所在的位置上，厚厚的落叶构成的腐植层被压出了一 条长沟，沟里很快渗出了水，陈年落叶使水呈暗红色，像血。 “小叶，过来歇歇吧。 ”白沐霖指指大树桩空着的另一边对叶文洁 说。文洁确实累了，放下工具，走过来和记者背靠背地坐着。 沉默了好一会儿，白沐霖突然说： “我看得出来你的感觉，在这里 也就我们俩有这种感觉。 ” 文洁仍然沉默着，白沐霖预料她不会回答。叶文洁平时沉默寡言， 很少与人交流，有些刚来的人甚至误认为她是哑巴。 白沐霖自顾自地说下去： “一年前打前站时我就到过这个林区，记 得刚到时是晌午，接待我们的人说要吃鱼，我在那间小树皮屋里四下看 看，就烧着一锅水，哪有鱼啊；水开后，见做饭的人拎着擀面杖出去，到 屋前的那条小河中‘乒乓’几棒子，就打上几条大鱼来……多富饶的地 方，可现在看看那条河，一条什么都没有的浑水沟。我真不知道，现在整 个兵团的开发方针是搞生产还是搞破坏？ ” “你这种想法是从哪儿来呢？”叶文洁轻声问，并没有透露出她对 这想法是赞同还是反对，但她能说话，已经让白沐霖很感激了。 “我刚看了一本书，感触很深……你能读英文吧？”看到文洁点点 头，白沐霖从包中掏出一本蓝色封面的书，在递给文洁时，他有意无意 地四下看了看， “这本书是六二年出的，在西方影响很大。 ” 文洁转身接过书，看到书名是《 SILENT SPRING 》 ） （《寂静的春 天》） ，作者是 Rachel Carson 。 “哪儿来的？ ”她轻声问。 “这本书引起了上级的重视，要搞内参，我负责翻译与森林有关的 那部分。 ” 文洁翻开书，很快被吸引住了，在短短的序章中，作者描述了一个 在杀虫剂的毒害下正在死去的寂静的村庄，平实的语言背后显现着一 中国科幻基石丛书 70 颗忧虑的心。 “我想给中央写信，反映建设兵团这种不负责任的行径。 ”白沐霖 说。 叶文洁从书上抬起头来，好半天才明白他意思，没说什么又低头看 书。 “你要想看就先拿着，不过最好别让其他人看见，这东西，你知道 ……”白沐霖说着，又四下看了看，起身离去。 三十八年后，在叶文洁的最后时刻，她回忆起《寂静的春天》对自 己一生的影响。在这之前，人类恶的一面已经在她年轻的心灵上刻下不 可愈合的巨创，但这本书使她对人类之恶第一次进行了理性的思考。这 本来应该是一本很普通的书，主题并不广阔，只是描述杀虫剂的滥用对 环境造成的危害，但作者的视角对叶文洁产生了巨大的震撼：蕾切尔 卡逊所描写的人类行为使用杀虫剂，在文洁看来只是一项正当和 正常的、至少是中性的行为；而本书让她看到，从整个大自然的视角看， 这个行为与“文化大革命”是没有区别的，对我们的世界产生的损害同 样严重。那么，还有多少在自己看来是正常甚至正义的人类行为是邪恶 的呢？ 再想下去，一个推论令她不寒而栗，陷入恐惧的深渊：也许，人类和 邪恶的关系，就是大洋与漂浮于其上的冰山的关系，它们其实是同一种 物质组成的巨大水体，冰山之所以被醒目地认出来，只是由于其形态不 同而已，而它实质上只不过是这整个巨大水体中极小的一部分……人 类真正的道德自觉是不可能的，就像他们不可能拔着自己的头发离开 大地。要做到这一点，只有借助于人类之外的力量。 这个想法最终决定了叶文洁的一生。 四天后，叶文洁去还书。白沐霖住在连队唯一的一间招待房里，文 洁推开门，见他疲惫地躺在床上，一身泥水和木屑，见到文洁，他赶紧起 身。 “今天干活儿了？ ”文洁问。 地球往事 三体 71 “下连队这么长时间了，不能总是甩手到处转，劳动得参加，三结 合嘛。哦，我们在雷达峰干，那里林木真密，地下的腐叶齐膝深，我真怕 中了瘴气。 ”白沐霖说。 “雷达峰？ ！ ”文洁听到这个名字很吃惊。 “是啊，团里下的紧急任务，要围着它伐出一圈警戒带。 ” 雷达峰是一个神秘的地方，那座陡峭的奇峰本没有名字，只是因为 它的峰顶有一面巨大的抛物面天线才得此名。其实，稍有常识的人都知 道那不是雷达天线，虽然它的方向每天都会变化，但从未连续转动过。 那天线在风中发出低沉的嗡嗡声，很远都能听到。连队的人只知道那是 一个军事基地，听当地人说，三年前建设那个基地时，曾动用巨大的人 力，向峰顶架设了一条高压线，开辟了一条通向峰顶的公路，有大量的 物资沿公路运上去。但基地建成后，竟把这条公路拆毁了，只留下一条 勉强能通行的林间小路，常有直升机在峰顶起降。 那座天线并不总是出现，风太大时它会被放倒，而当它立起来时， 就会发生许多诡异的事情：林间的动物变得焦躁不安，林鸟被大群地惊 起，人也会出现头晕恶心等许多不明症状。在雷达峰附近的人还特别容 易掉头发，据当地人说，这也是天线出现后才有的事。 雷达峰有许多神秘的传说：一次下大雪，那个天线立起来，这方圆 几里的雪立刻就变成了雨！严寒中，雨水在树上冻成冰，每棵树都挂起 了大冰挂子，森林成了水晶宫，其间不断地响着树枝被压断的“咔嚓” 声和冰挂子坠地的“轰轰”声。有时，在天线立起时，晴空会出现雷电， 夜间天空中能看到奇异的光晕……雷达峰警戒森严，建设兵团的连队 驻扎后，连长第一件事就是让所有人注意不要擅自靠近雷达峰，否则基 地的岗哨可以不经警告就开枪。上星期，连队里两个打猎的兵团战士追 一只狍子，不知不觉追到了雷达峰下，立刻招来了来自半山腰上岗亭的 急促射击，幸亏林子密，两人没伤着跑了回来，其中一个吓得尿了一裤 子。第二天连里开会，每人挨了一个警告处分。可能正是因为这事，基地 才决定在周围的森林中开伐一圈警戒带，而兵团的人力可以随他们调 中国科幻基石丛书 72 用，也可见其行政级别很高。 白沐霖接过书，小心地放到枕头下面，同时从那里拿出了几页写得 密密麻麻的稿纸，递给文洁， “这是那封信的草稿，你看看行吗？ ” “信？ ” “我跟你说过的，要给中央写信。 ” 纸上的字迹很潦草，叶文洁很吃力地看完了。这封信立论严谨，内 容丰富：从太行山因植被破坏，由历史上的富庶之山变成今天贫瘠的秃 岭，到现代黄河泥沙含量的急剧增加，得出了内蒙古建设兵团的大垦荒 将带来严重后果的结论。文洁这才注意到，他的文笔真的与《寂静的春 天》很相似，平实精确而蕴涵诗意，令理科出身的她感到很舒适。 “写得很好。 ”她由衷地赞叹道。 白沐霖点点头， “那我寄出去了。 ”说着拿出了一本新稿纸要誊抄， 但手抖得厉害，一个字都写不出来。第一次使油锯的人都是这样，手抖 得可能连饭碗都端不住，更别说写字了。 “我替你抄吧。 ”叶文洁说，接过白沐霖递来的笔抄了起来。 “你字写得真好。 ”白沐霖看着稿纸上抄出的第一行字说，他给文 洁倒了一杯水，手仍然抖得厉害，水洒出来不少，文洁忙把信纸移开些。 “你是学物理的？ ”白沐霖问。 “天体物理，现在没什么用处了。 ”文洁回答，没有抬头。 “那就是研究恒星吧，怎么会没用处呢？现在大学都已复课，但研 究生不再招了，你这样的高级人才窝到这种地方，唉……” 文洁没有回答，只是埋头抄写，她不想告诉白沐霖，自己能进入建 设兵团已经很幸运了。对于现实，她什么都不想说，也没什么可说的了。 屋里安静下来，只有钢笔尖在纸上划动的沙沙声。文洁能闻到身边 记者身上松木锯末的味道，自父亲惨死后，她第一次有一种温暖的感 觉，第一次全身心松弛下来，暂时放松了对周围世界的戒心。 一个多小时后，信抄完了，又按白沐霖说的地址和收信人写好了信 封，文洁起身告辞，走到门口时，她回头说： “把你的外衣拿来，我帮你 地球往事 三体 73 洗洗吧。 ”说完后，她对自己的这一举动很吃惊。 “不，那哪行！ ”白沐霖连连摆手说， “你们建设兵团的女战士，白 天干的都是男同志的活儿，快回去休息吧，明天六点就要上山呢。哦，文 洁，我后天就要回师部了，我会把你的情况向上级反映一下，也许能帮 上忙呢。 ” “谢谢，不过我觉得这里很好，挺安静的。 ”文洁看着月光下大兴安 岭朦胧的林海说。 “你是不是在逃避什么？ ” “我走了。 ”叶文洁轻声说，转身离去。 白沐霖看着她那纤细的身影在月光下消失，然后，他抬头遥望文洁 刚才看过的林海，看到远方的雷达峰上，巨大的天线又缓缓立起，闪着 金属的冷光。 三个星期后的一天中午，叶文洁被从伐木场紧急召回连部。一走进 办公室，她就发现气氛不对，连长和指导员都在，还有一个表情冷峻的 陌生人，他面前的办公桌上放着一个黑色的公文包，旁边两件东西显然 是从公文包中拿出来的，那是一个信封和一本书，信封是拆开的，书就 是那本她看过的《寂静的春天》 。 这个年代的人对自己的政治处境都有一种特殊的敏感，而这种敏 感在叶文洁身上更强烈一些，她顿时感到周围的世界像一个口袋般收 紧，一切都向她挤压过来。 “叶文洁，这是师政治部来调查的张主任， ”指导员指指陌生人说， “希望你配合，要讲实话。 ” “这封信是你写的吗？”张主任问，同时从信封中抽出信来。叶文洁 伸手去拿，但张主任没给她，仍把信拿在自己手中，一页一页翻给她看， 终于翻到了她想看的最后一页，落款上没有姓名，只写着“革命群众” 四个字。 “不，不是我写的。 ”文洁惊恐地摇摇头。 中国科幻基石丛书 74 “可这是你的笔迹。 ” “是，可我是帮别人抄的。 ” “帮谁？ ” 平时在连队遇到什么事，叶文洁很少为自己申辩，所有的亏都默默 地吃了，所有的委屈都默默地承受，更不用说牵连别人了。但这次不同， 她很清楚这意味着什么。 “是帮那位上星期到连队来采访的《大生产报》记者抄的，他叫 ……” “叶文洁！ ”张主任的眼睛像两个黑洞洞的枪口对着她， “我警告 你，诬陷别人会使你的问题更加严重。我们已经从白沐霖同志那里调查 清楚了，他只是受你之托把信带到呼和浩特发出去，并不知道信的内 容。” “他……是这么说的？ ！ ”文洁眼前一黑。 张主任没有回答她的话，而是拿起了那本书， “你写这封信，一定 是受到了它的启发。 ”他把书对着连长和指导员展示了一下， “这本书 叫《寂静的春天》 ， 1962 年在美国出版，在资本主义世界影响很大。 ”他 接着从公文包中拿出了另一本书， 封面是白皮黑字， “这是这本书的中 译本，是有关部门以内参形式下发的，供批判用。现在，上级对这本书已 经做出了明确的定性：这是一部反动的大毒草。该书从唯心史观出发， 宣扬末世论，借环境问题之名，为资本主义世界最后的腐朽没落寻找托 辞，其实质是十分反动的。 ” “可这本书……也不是我的。 ”文洁无力地说。 “白沐霖同志是上级指定的本书译者之一，他携带这本书是完全 合法的，当然，他也负有保管责任，不该让你趁他在劳动中不备时偷拿 去看现在，你从这本书中找到了向社会主义进攻的思想武器。 ” 叶文洁沉默了，她知道自己已经掉到陷阱的底部，任何挣扎都是徒 劳的。 与后来人们熟知的一些历史记载相反，白沐霖当初并非有意陷害 地球往事 三体 75 叶文洁，他写给中央的那封信也可能是出于真诚的责任心。那时怀着各 种目的直接给中央写信的人很多，大多数信件石沉大海，也有少数人因 此一夜之间飞黄腾达或面临灭顶之灾。当时的政治神经是极其错综复 杂的，作为记者，白沐霖自以为了解这神经系统的走向和敏感之处，但 他过分自信了，他这封信触动了他以前不知道的雷区。得知消息后，恐 惧压倒了一切，他决定牺牲叶文洁，保护自己。 半个世纪后，历史学家们一致认为， 1969 年的这一事件是以后人 类历史的一个转折点。 白沐霖无意之中成为一个标志性的关键历史人物，但他自己没有 机会知道这点，历史学家们失望地记载了他平淡的余生。白沐霖在《大 生产报》一直工作到 1975 年，那时内蒙古建设兵团撤销，他调到一个 东北城市的科协工作至上世纪八十年代初，然后出国到加拿大，在渥太 华一所华语学校任教师至 1991 年， 患肺癌去世。 余生中他没对任何人 提起过叶文洁的事，是否感到过自责和忏悔也不得而知。 “小叶啊， 连里对你可是仁至义尽了。 ” 连长喷出一口辣烈的莫合 烟，看着地面说， “你出身和家庭背景都不好，可我们没把你当外人。针 对你脱离群众、不积极要求进步的倾向，我和指导员都多次找你谈过， 想帮助你。谁想到，你竟犯了这么严重的错误！ ” “我早就看出来，她对‘文化大革命’的抵触情绪是根深蒂固的。 ” 指导员接着说。 “下午，派两个人，把她和这些罪证一起送到师部去。 ”张主任面无 表情地说。 同室的三名女犯相继被提走，监室里只剩叶文洁一个人了。墙角的 那一小堆煤用完了也没人来加，炉子很快灭了，监室里冷了下来，叶文 洁不得不将被子裹在身上。 天黑前来了两个人，其中一名是年长些的女干部，随行的那人介绍 说她是中级法院军管会的军代表。 中国科幻基石丛书 76 “程丽华。 ”女干部自我介绍说，她四十多岁，身穿军大衣，戴着一 副宽边眼镜，脸上线条柔和，看得出年轻时一定很漂亮，说话时面带微 笑，让人感到平易近人。叶文洁清楚，这样级别的人来到监室见一个待 审的犯人，很不寻常。她谨慎地对程丽华点点头，起身在狭窄的床铺上 给她让出坐的地方。 “这么冷，炉子呢？”程丽华不满地看了站在门口的看守所所长一 眼，又转向文洁， “嗯，年轻，你比我想的还年轻。 ”说完坐在床上，离文 洁很近，低头翻起公文包来，嘴里还像老大妈似的嘟囔着， “小叶你糊 涂啊，年轻人都这样，书越读得多越糊涂了，你呀你呀……”她找到了 要找的东西，把那一小打文件抱在胸前，抬头看着叶文洁，目光中充满 了慈爱， “不过，年轻人嘛，谁没犯过错误？我就犯过，那时我在四野的 文工团，苏联歌曲唱得好，一次政治学习会上，我说我们应该并入苏联， 成为苏维埃社会主义联盟的一个新共和国，这样国际共产主义的力量 就更强大了……幼稚啊，可谁没幼稚过呢？还是那句话，不要有思想负 担，有错就认识就改，然后继续革命嘛。 ” 程丽华的一席话拉近了叶文洁与她的距离，但叶文洁在灾难中学 会了谨慎，她不敢贸然接受这份奢侈的善意。 程丽华把那叠文件放到叶文洁面前的床面上，递给她一枝笔， “来，先签了字，咱们再好好谈谈，解开你的思想疙瘩。 ”她的语气，仿佛 在哄一个小孩儿吃奶。 叶文洁默默地看着那份文件，一动不动，没有去接笔。 程丽华宽容地笑笑， “你是可以相信我的，我以人格保证，这文件内 容与你的案子无关，签字吧。 ” 站在一边的那名随行者说： “叶文洁，程代表是想帮你的，她这几 天为你的事可没少操心。 ” 程丽华挥手制止他说下去。 “能理解的，这孩子，唉，给吓坏了。现 在一些人的政策水平实在太低，建设兵团的，还有你们法院的，方法简 单，作风粗暴，像什么样子！好吧，小叶，来，看看文件，仔细看看吧。 ” 地球往事 三体 77 叶文洁拿起文件，在监室昏黄的灯光下翻看着。程代表没骗她，这 份材料确实与她的案子无关，是关于她那已死去的父亲的。其中记载了 父亲与一些人交往情况和谈话内容，文件的提供者是叶文洁的妹妹叶 文雪。作为一名最激进的红卫兵，叶文雪积极主动地揭发父亲，写过大 量的检举材料，其中的一些直接导致了父亲的惨死。但这一份材料文洁 一眼就看出不是妹妹写的，文雪揭发父亲的材料文笔激烈，读那一行行 字就像听着一挂挂炸响的鞭炮，但这份材料写得很冷静、很老到，内容 翔实精确，谁谁谁哪年哪月哪日在哪里见了谁谁谁又谈了什么，外行人 看去像一本平淡的流水账，但其中暗藏的杀机，绝非叶文雪那套小孩子 把戏所能相比的。 材料的内容她看不太懂，但隐约感觉到与一个重大国防工程有关。 作为物理学家的女儿，叶文洁猜出了那就是从 1964 年开始震惊世界的 中国两弹工程。在这个年代，要搞倒一个位置很高的人，就要在其分管 的各个领域得到他的黑材料，但两弹工程对阴谋家们来说是个棘手的 领域，这个工程处于中央的重点保护之下，得以避开“文革”的风雨，他 们很难插手进去。 由于出身问题没通过政审，父亲并没有直接参加两弹研制，只是做 了一些外围的理论工作，但要利用他，比利用两弹工程的那些核心人物 更容易些。叶文洁不知道材料上那些内容是真是假，但可以肯定，上面 的每一个标点符号都具有致命的政治杀伤力。除了最终的打击目标外， 还会有无数人的命运要因这份材料坠入悲惨的深渊。材料的末尾是妹妹 那大大的签名，而叶文洁是要作为附加证人签名的，她注意到，那个 位置已经有三个人签了名。 “我不知道父亲和这些人说的这些话。 ”叶文洁把材料放回原位， 低声说。 “怎么会不知道呢？这其中许多的谈话都是在你家里进行的，你妹 妹都知道你就不知道？ ” “我真的不知道。 ” 中国科幻基石丛书 78 “但这些谈话内容是真实的，你要相信组织。 ” “我没说不是真的，可我真的不知道，所以不能签。 ” “叶文洁， ”那名随行人员上前一步说，但又被程代表制止了。她朝 文洁坐得更近些，拉起她一只冰凉的手，说： “小叶啊，我跟你交个底吧。你这个案子，弹性很大的，往低的说， 知识青年受反动书籍蒙蔽，没什么大事，都不用走司法程序，参加一次 学习班好好写几份检查，你就可以回兵团了；往高说嘛，小叶啊，你心里 也清楚，判现行反革命是完全可以的。对于你这种政治案件，现在公检 法系统都是宁左勿右，左是方法问题，右是路线问题，最终大方向还是 要军管会定。当然，这话只能咱们私下说说。 ” 随行人员说： “程代表是真的为你好，你自己看到了，已经有三个 证人签字了，你签不签又有多大意义。叶文洁，你别一时糊涂啊。 ” “是啊，小叶，看着你这个有知识的孩子就这么毁了，心疼啊！我真 的想救你，你千万要配合。看看我，我难道会害你吗？ ” 叶文洁没有看军代表，她看到了父亲的血。 “程代表，我不知道上 面写的事，我不会签的。 ” 程丽华沉默了，她盯着文洁看了好一会儿，冰冷的空气仿佛凝固了 一般。然后她慢慢地将文件放回公文包，站起身，她脸上慈祥的表情仍 然没有褪去，只是凝固了，仿佛戴着一张石膏面具。她就这样慈祥地走 到墙角，那里放着一桶盥洗用的水，她提起桶，把里面的水一半泼到叶 文洁的身上，一半倒在被褥上，动作中有一种有条不紊的沉稳，然后扔 下桶转身走出门，扔下了一句怒骂： “顽固的小杂种！ ” 看守所所长最后一个走，他冷冷地看了浑身湿透的文洁一眼， “咣”一声关上门并锁上了。 在这内蒙古的严冬，寒冷通过湿透的衣服，像一个巨掌将叶文洁攥 在其中，她听到自己牙齿打颤的“咯咯”声，后来这声音也消失了。深入 骨髓的寒冷使她眼中的现实世界变成一片乳白色，她感到整个宇宙就 是一块大冰，自己是这块冰中唯一的生命体。她这个将被冻死的小女孩 地球往事 三体 79 儿手中连火柴都没有，只有幻觉了…… 她置身于其中的冰块渐渐变得透明了，眼前出现了一座大楼，楼上 有一个女孩儿在挥动着一面大旗，她的纤小与那面旗的阔大形成鲜明 对比，那是文洁的妹妹叶文雪。自从与自己的反动学术权威家庭决裂 后，叶文洁再也没有听到过她的消息，直到不久前才知道妹妹已于两年 前惨死于武斗。恍惚中，挥旗的人变成了白沐霖，他的眼镜反射着楼下 的火光；接着那人又变成了程代表，变成了母亲绍琳，甚至变成父亲。旗 手在不断变换，旗帜在不间断地被挥舞着，像一只永恒的钟摆，倒数着 她那所剩无几的生命。 渐渐地旗帜模糊了，一切都模糊了，那块充满宇宙的冰块又将她封 在中心，这次冰块是黑色的。,"2 S i l e n t S p r i n g T wo years later , the Greater Khingan Mountains “T im-ber…” Following the loud chant, a lar ge Dahurian larch, thick as the columns of the Parthenon, fell with a thump, and Y e W enjie felt the earth quake. She picked up her ax and saw and began to clear the branches from the trunk. Every time she did this, she felt as though she were cleaning the corpse o f a giant. Sometimes she even imagined the giant was her father . The feelings from that terrible night two years ago when she cleaned her father ’ s body in the mortuary would resurface, and the splits and cracks in the larch bark seemed to turn into the old scars and new woun ds covering her father . Over one hundred thousand peo ple from the six divisions and forty-one regiments of the Inner Mongolia Production and Construction Corps were scattered among the vast forests and grasslands. When they first left the cities and arrived at this unfamiliar wilderness, many of the corps’ “educated youth s”young college students who no longer had schools to go tohad cherished a romantic wish: When the tank clusters of the Soviet Revisionist Imperialists rolled over the Sino-Mongolian border , they would arm themselves and make their own bodies the first barrier in the Republic’ s defense. Indeed, this expectation was one of the strategic considerations motivating the creation of the Production and Construction Corps.But the war the y craved was l ike a mountain at the other end of the grassland: clear ly visible, but as far away as a mirage. So they had to content themselves with clearing fields, grazing animals, and chopping down trees. Soon, th e young men and women who had once expended their youthful ener gy on tours to the holy sites of the Chinese Revolution discovered that, compared to the huge sky and open air of Inner Mongolia, the biggest cities in C hina’ s interior were nothing more than sheep pens. Stuck in the middle of the cold, end less expanse of forests and grasslands, their burning ardor was mea ningless. Even if they spilled all of their blood, it would cool faster than a pile of cow dung, and no t be as useful. But burning was their fate; they were the ge neration meant to be consumed by fire. And so, under their chain saws, vast seas of forests turned into barren ridges and denuded hills. Under their tractors and combine harvesters, vast tracts of grasslands became grain fields, then deserts. Y e W enjie could only describe the deforestation that she witnessed as madness. The tall Dahurian larch, the ever green Scots pine, t he slim and straight white birch, the cloud-p iercing Korean aspen, the aromatic Siberian fir , along with black birch, oak, mountain elm, Chosenia arbutifolia  whatever they laid eyes on, they cut down. Her company wielded hundreds of c hain saws l ike a swarm of steel locusts, and after they passed, only stumps were left. The fallen Dahurian larch, now bereft of branches, was ready to be taken away by tractor . Y e gently caressed the freshly exposed cross section of the felled tru nk. She did this often, as though such surfaces were giant wounds, as though she could feel the tree’ s pain. Suddenly , she saw another hand lig htly stro king the matching surface of the stump a few feet away . The trem ors in that hand revealed a heart that resonated with h ers. Though the hand was pale, she could tell it belonged to a man. She looked up. It was Bai Mulin. A slender , delicate man who wore glasses, he was a reporter for the Gr eat Pr oduction News, the corps’ newspaper . He had arrived the day before yesterday to gather news about her company . Y e remembered reading his articles, which were written in a beautiful style, sensitive and fine, ill suited to the rough-hewn environment. “Ma Gang, come here,” Bai called to a young man a little ways of f. Ma was bar rel-chested and muscula r , like the Dahurian larch that he had justfelled. H e came over , and Bai asked him, “Do you know how old this tree was?” “Y ou can count the rings.” Ma pointed to the stump. “I di d. M ore tha n three hundred and thirty years. Do you remem ber how long it took you to saw through it?” “No more than ten minutes. Le t me tell you, I’m the fastest ch ain saw operator in the c ompany . Which ever squad I’m with, the red flag for model workers follows me.” Ma Gang’ s excitement was typical of most people Bai paid attention to. T o be featured in the Gr eat Pr oduction News would be a considerable honor . “More than three hundred year s! A dozen generations. When this tree was but a shrub, it was still the Ming Dynasty . During all thes e years, can you ima gine ho w many storms it had weathered, how many events it had witnessed? But in a few minutes you cut it down. Y ou really felt nothing?” “What d o you want me to feel?” Ma Gang gave a blank look. “It’ s just a tree. The only things we don’ t lack around here are trees. Ther e are plenty of other trees much older than this one.” “It’ s all right. Go back to work.” Bai shook his head, sat dow n on the stump, and sighed. Ma Gan g shook his head as well, disappointed that the reporte r wasn’ t interested in an interview . “Intellectuals always make a fuss about nothing,” he muttered. As he spoke, he g lanced at Y e W enjie, apparently including her in his judgment. The trun k was dragged away . Rocks and stumps in the ground b roke the bark in more pla ces, wounding the giant body further . In the sp ot where it once stood, the weight of the fa llen tree being dragged left a deep channel in th e layers of decomposing le aves that had accumulated over the years. W ater quickly filled the ditch. The rotting leaves made the water appear crimson, like blood. “W enjie, come and take a rest.” Bai pointed to the empty half of the stump on which he was sitting. Y e was indeed tired. She put dow n her tools, came over , and sat down with Bai, back to back. After a long sile nce, Bai blurted out, “I can tell how you’re feeling. The two of us are the only ones who feel this way .” Y e r emained silent. Bai knew that she likely wouldn’ t answer . She was a woman of few w ords, and rarely conversed with anyone. Some n ew arrivalseven mistook her for a mute. Bai went on talking. “I visited this region a year ago. I remember arriving around noon, and my h osts told me that we’d have fish for lunch. I looked around the bark-lined hut and saw only a pot of water being boiled. No f ish. Then, a s soon as the water boiled, the cook went out with a rolling pin. He stood on the shore of the brook that passed before the hut, struck the water with the rolling pin a few times, and was able to drag a few big fish out of the water .… What a fer tile place! But now , if you go look at that brook, it’ s just dead, muddy w ater in a ditch. I really don’ t know if the Corps is engaged in construction or destruction.” “Where did you get thoughts like that?” Y e asked softly . She did not exp ress agreement or disagreement, but Bai was grateful that she had spoken at all. “I just read a book, and it really moved me. Can you read English?” Y e nodded. Bai took a book with a blue cover from his bag. He looked arou nd to be sure no one was watching, and handed it to her . “This was published in 1962 and was very influential in the W est.” W enjie t urned around on the st ump to accept the book. Silent Spring, she read on the cover , by Rachel Carson . “Where did you get this?” “The book attracted the atten tion of the higher -ups. They want to distribute it to select cadres6 for internal re ference. I’m responsible for translating the part that has to do with forests.” W enjie o pened t he book and wa s pulled in. In a brief opening chapter , the a uthor described a quiet town silently dying from the use o f pesticides. Carson’ s deep concern suf fused the simple, plain sentences. “I w ant to write to the leadership in Beijing and let them know about the irresponsible behavior of the Construction Corps,” Bai said. Y e look ed up from the book. It took a while for her to pro cess his words. She said nothing and turned her eyes back to the page. “Keep it for now , if you want to read it. But best be careful and don’ t let anyone see it. Y ou know what they think of this kind of book…” Bai got up, looked around carefully once again, and left. * * *More th an four decades later , in her last moments, Y e W enjie w ould recall the influence Silent Spring had on her life. The book dealt only with a limited subject: the negative environmental ef fects o f excessive pesticide use. But the perspective taken by the author shook Y e to the core. The use of pesticides had seemed to Y e just a normal, properor , at least, neutralac t, but Carson’ s book allowed Y e to see that, from Na ture’ s pe rspective, their use was indistinguishable from the Cultural Revolution, and equally destructive to our world. If this was s o, then how many other acts of humankind that had seemed normal or even righteous were, in reality , evil? As s he continued to mull over these thoughts, a deduction m ade her shudder: Is it possible that the r elationship between humanity and evil is similar t o the r elationship betwe en the ocean and an iceber g floating on its surface? Both the ocean and the iceber g ar e made of the sam e material. That the iceber g seems separate is only because it is in a differ ent form. In r eality , it is but a part of the vast ocean.… It w as impossible to expect a m oral awakening fr om humankin d itself, just like it was impossible to expect humans to lift off the earth by pulling up on th eir own ha ir . T o achieve m oral awakening r equir ed a for ce outside the human race. This thought determined the entire direction of Y e’ s life. * * * Four days after receiving the bo ok, Y e went to the company’ s guesthouse, where Bai was l iving, to return the book. Y e opened the door and saw that Bai was lying on the bed, exhausted and covered by wood shavings and mud. When Bai saw Y e, he struggled to get up. “Did you work today?” Y e asked. “I’ve be en here with the company for so long. I can’ t just walk around all day doing nothing. Have to participate in labor . That’ s the spirit of the revolution, right ? Oh, I worked near Radar Peak. The trees there were so dense. I sank in to the rotting lea ves all the way up to my knees. I’m afraid I’ll get sick from the miasma.” “Radar Peak?” Y e was shocked.“Y es. Th e regiment had an eme r gency assignment: clear out a warning zone all around the peak by cutting down trees.” Radar Peak was a mysterious pl ace. The steep, once-nameless peak got its moniker from the lar ge parabolic antenna dish at the top. In reality , everyone with a little common sense knew it wasn’ t a radar an tenna: Even though its orientation changed every day , the antenna never moved in a continuous man ner . As the wind blew past it, the dish emitted a howl that could be heard from far away . People i n Y e’ s company knew only that Radar Peak was a milita ry base. According to the locals, when the base was built three years ago, the military mobiliz ed a lot of people to construct a road leading to the top and to string a pow er line along it. T ons of supplies were transported up the mountain. But after the completion of the base, the road was destroyed, leaving behind only a dif ficult trail that snaked between the trees. Often helicopters could be seen landing on and lifting of f the peak. The antenna wasn’ t always vis ible. When the wind was too strong, it was retracted. But when it wa s extended, many strange things occurred around the area: Animals in the forest be came noisy and anxious, flocks of birds erupted from the woods, and p eople suf fered nausea and dizziness. Also, those wh o lived near Radar Peak tended to lose their hair . According to the locals, these phenomena only began after the antenna was built. There w ere many strange stories associated with Radar Peak. One time, when it was snowing, the ante nna was extended, and the sno w instantly turned to rain. Since the temper ature near ground was still belo w freezing, the r ain turned to ice on the tree s. Gigantic icicles hung from th e trees, and the forest turned into a crystal palace. From time to time, branches cracked under th e weight of the ice, and the icicles crashed to the groun d with loud thumps. Sometimes, when the antenna was extended, a clear day would turn to thunder and lightning, and strange lights would appear in the night sky . After the arrival of the Constru ction Corps company , the commander told everyone right away to take care to avoid approaching the heavily guarded Radar Peak, because the patrols were allowed to shoot without warning. Last week, two of the men had gone hunting and chased a dee r to the foot of Radar P eak without realizing where they were, and the sentriesstationed halfwa y up the peak shot at them. Luckily , the forest was so dense that the two escaped without i njury , though one of the men peed in his pants. At the co mpany meeting the next day , both men were re primanded. Maybe it was be cause of this in cident that the base had directed the Corps to create a warning zone in the forest around the peak. The fact that the base could is sue labor assignments to the Construction Corps hinted at its political power . Bai Mu lin acce pted the book f rom Y e and carefully hid it under his pillow . F rom the same place, he retrieved a few sheets of pape r filled with dense writing and handed them to her . “This is a draft of my letter . W ould you read it?” “Letter?” “Like I was telling you, I want to write to the central leadership in Beijing.” The han dwriting was very sloppy , and Y e had to read it slowly . But the content was informative and tig htly ar gued. The letter began by describing how the T aihang Mountains had turned from a historically fer tile place to the barren wasteland it was today as a result of deforestation. It then described the recent, rapid rise in the Y ellow River ’ s silt content. Finally , it concluded that the Inner Mongolia Production and Construction Corps’ actions would lead to severe ecological consequences. Y e noticed that Bai’ s style was similar to that of Silent Spring, precise and plain, but also poetic. Though her background was in technical subjects, she enjoyed the literary prose. “It’ s beautiful,” she said sincerely . Bai nodded. “Then I’ll send it.” He took out a few fresh sheets of paper to make a clean copy of the draft. But his hands shook so much that he couldn’ t form any characters. T his was a common reaction a fter using a chain saw for the first time. Their trembling hands couldn’ t even hold a rice bowl steady , let alone write legibly . “Why don’ t I copy it for you?” Y e said. She took the pen from him. “Y ou ha ve such pretty handwriting,” Bai said as he looked at her first line of characters on the page. H e poured a glass of water for Y e. His hands shook so much t hat he spilled so me of the water . Y e moved the letter out of the way . “Y ou studied physics?” Bai asked.“Astrophysics. Useless now .” Y e did not even lift her head. “Y ou study the s tars. How can that be useless? Colleges have r eopened recently , but they’re not taking graduate students. For highly educated and skilled individuals like you to be sent to a place like this…” Y e said nothing and kept on writ ing. She did not want to tell Bai that for someone like her to be able to join the Construction Corps was very fortunate. She didn’ t want to comment on the way things werethere was nothing worthwhile to say . The hut became quiet, filled on ly with the sound of pen nib sc ratching against p aper . Y e could smell th e fragrance of the sawdust on Bai’ s body . For the first time since the deat h of her father , she experienced warmth in her heart and all owed herself to relax, momentarily letting dow n her guard against the world. More th an an hour later , she was done copying the letter . She w rote out the address on the envelope as Bai dictated it and got up to say good-bye. At th e d oor , she turned around. “Let me have your jacket. I’ll wa sh it for you.” She was surprised by her own boldness. “No! How can I do that?” Bai shook his head. “The woman wa rriors of the Construction Corps work just as hard as the men every day . Y ou should get back to have some rest. T omorrow you have to get up at six to work in the mou ntains. Oh, W enjie, I’ll be heading back to division headquarters the day afte r tomorr ow . I will expla in your situation to my superior s. Maybe it will help.” “Thank you. But I like it here. I t’ s quiet.” Y e looked at the dim outline of the dark woods in the moonlight. “Are you trying to run away from something?” “I’m leaving,” Y e said in a soft voice. And she did. Bai wat ched her slender figure disappear in the moonlight. Then he lifted hi s gaze to the dark woo ds that she had been looking at a moment earlier . In the distance, the gigantic antenna on top of Radar Peak rose once again, giving of f a cold, metallic glint. * * *One afternoon three weeks la ter , Y e W enjie was summoned back to company headqu arters from the logging camp. As soon as she entered the of fice, s he sense d the mood wa s wrong. The company commander and the political instructor were both present, along with a stranger w ith a stern expression. On the desk in front of the stranger was a black briefcase, and an envel ope and a book lay next to it. The envelope was open, and the book was the copy of Silent Spring that she had read. During those years, everyone had a special sensitivity for their own political situatio n. The sense wa s especially acute in Y e W enjie. She felt the world ar ound he r closing in lik e a sack being drawn shut, and everything pressing in on her . “Y e W enjie, this is Director Zha ng of the Division Political Dep artment. He’ s here to inv estigate.” Her political instructor pointed at the stranger . “W e hope you will cooperate fully and tell the truth.” “Did yo u write this letter?” Director Zhang asked. He pulled the letter out of the envel ope. Y e reached for it, but Zhang held on to the letter and showed it to her page by page until he reached the very last page, the one she was most interested in. There was no signature except “The Revolutionary Masses.” “No, I did not write this.” Y e shook her head in fright. “But this is your handwriting.” “Y es, but I just copied it for someone else.” “Who?” Normally , when ever she suf fered some injustice at the comp any , Y e refused to protest openly . She simply endured silently , and would never consider implicating others. But this time was dif ferent. She understood very well what this meant. “I helped a reporter from the Gr eat Pr oduction News . H e was here a few weeks ago. His name is” “Y e W en jie!” D irector Zhang’ s two black eyes were trained on her like the barrels of two guns. “I am w arning you: Framing others will only make your pro blem w orse. W e’ve already clarified the situation with Comrade Bai Mul in. His only involvement was posting the letter from Hohhot under your direction. He had no idea as to the letter ’ s contents.” “He … he said that?” Y e felt everything go black before her eyes.Instead of answering, Director Zhang picked up the book. “Y our letter was clea rly insp ired by this bo ok.” He showed the book to the company director and the political instructor . “ Silent Spring was published in America in 1962 and has been quite influential in the capitalist world.” He then took another book out of the briefcase. The cover was white with black characters. “This is the Chinese translation. The appropriate authorities distri buted it to selec t cadres as internal reference so that it could be c riticized. As of now , the app ropriate authorities have already given their clear jud gment: The book is a toxic piece of reactionary propaganda. It takes the stance of pure histo rical idealism and espouses a doomsday theory . Under the guise of disc ussing environmental problems, it seeks to justify t he ultimate corruption of the capitalist world. The content is extremely reactionary .” “But this book … it doesn’ t belong to me.” “Comrade Bai was appointed as a translator by the app ropriate authorities. So it was perfectly l egitimate for him to carry it. Of course, he is re spons ible for being careless a nd allowing you to steal it while he was participating in Construction Corps work assignments. From this book, you obtained intellectual weapons that could be used to attack socialism.” Y e W enj ie held her tongue. She knew that she had already fallen to the bottom of the pit. Any struggle was useless. * * * Contrary to certain historical records that later became pub licized, Bai Mulin did not intend to frame Y e W enjie at the start. The letter he wrote to the central leadership in Beiji ng was likely based on a real sense of responsibility . Back then, many people wrote to the central leadership with all k inds of personal agendas. M ost of these letters were neve r answered, but a few of the letter writ ers did see their political fo rtunes rise meteorically overnight, while others invited catastrophe. T he political currents of the time were extremely complex. As a reporter , Bai believed he could re ad the currents and a void dangerous sensitivities, but he was overconfident, a nd his letter touched a minefield that he did not know existed. After he heard about its reception, fear overwhelmed everything else. In order to protect himself, he decided to sacrifice Y e W enjie.Half a century later , historians would all agree that this event in 1969 was a turning point in humankind’ s history . W ithout intendin g to, Bai becam e a key historical figure. But he never learned of this fact. Historians recorded the rest of his uneventful life with disappointment. He continued to work at Gr eat Pr oduction News until 1975, when the Inner Mongoli a Production and Construction Corps was disbanded. He was then sent to a city in Northeast China to w ork for the Science Association until the beginning of the eighties. Then he left the country for Canada, where he taught at a Chinese school in Ottawa until 1991, when he died from lung cancer . For the rest of his life, he never mentioned Y e W enjie, and we do not know if he ever felt remorse or repented for his actions. * * * “W enjie, the company has treated you extremely well.” The company commander exhaled a thick cloud of smoke from his Mohe tobacco. He stared at the gr ound and continued. “By birth and family b ackground, you’re p olitically suspect. But we’ve always treated you as one of our own. Both the political instructor and I have spoken to you m any times concerning your tendency to sequester yourself from the people, and your lack of self-mot ivation in seeking progress. W e want to help you. But look at you! Y ou’ve committed such a serious error!” The political instructor picked up the theme. “I’ve always said that I thought she had a deep-rooted resentment of the Cultural Revolution.” “Have her escorted to division headquarters this afternoon, alo ng with the evidence of her crime,” Director Zhang said, his face impassive. * * * The three other women prisoners in the cell were taken away one by one until on ly Y e was left. The small pile of coal in the corner had been exhausted, and no one came to replenish it. The fire in the stov e had gone out a while ago. It was so cold in the cell that Y e had to wrap h erself in the blanket. T wo of ficials came to her befo re it got dark. The older one, a female cadre, w as introduced by her as sociate as the military representative fromthe Intermediate People’ s Court.7 “My name is Cheng Lihua,” the cadre introduced herself. She was in her forties, d ressed in a military coat, and wore thick-rimmed glass es. Her face was gentle, and it was clear that she had been very beautiful when she was young. She spoke with a smile and instantly made people like her . Y e W enjie u nderstood that it was unusual for such a high-grade cadre to visit a prisoner about to be tried. Cautiously , she nodded at Cheng and moved to make space on her narrow cot so she could sit down. “It’ s really cold in here. What happened to your stove?” Cheng gave a reprimanding look to the head of the detention center standing at the door of the c ell. She tur ned back to Y e. “Hmm, you’re very young. Ev en younger than I imagined.” She sat down on the cot right next to Y e and rummaged in her b riefcase, still mu ttering. “W enjie, you’re very confused. Y oung people are all the same. T he more books you read , the more confused you becom e. Eh, what can I say .…” She found what she was looking for and took out a small bundle of papers. Looking at Y e, her eye s were filled with kindness and af fection. “But it’ s not a big deal. What young person hasn’ t made some mistakes? I made m istakes myself. When I w as a young woman, as a member of the art troupe fo r the Fourth Field Army , I specialized in singing Soviet songs. One time, during a p olitical study session, I announced that China should cease to be a separate country and join the USSR as a member republic. That way , international communism would be further strengthened. How n ave I was! But who wasn’ t once nave? What’ s done is done. When you make a mistake, what’ s important is to recognize it and correct it. Then you can continue the revolution.” Cheng’ s words seemed to draw Y e closer to her . But after having gone through so many troubles, Y e had learned to be cautious. She did not dare to believe in this kindness, which almost resembled a luxury . Cheng placed the stack of pape rs on the bed in front of Y e and handed her a pen. “Come now , sign thi s. Then we can have a good heart-to-heart and resolve your ideological dif ficulties.” Her tone was like that of a mother trying to encourage her daughter to eat.Y e stare d at the stack of papers silently and motionlessly . She did not pick up the pen. Cheng gave her a for giving smile. “Y ou can trust me, W enjie. I personally guarantee that this document has nothing to do with your case. Go ahead. Sign it.” Her associate, who stood to the side, added, “Y e W enjie, Repres entative Cheng is trying to help you. She’ s been working hard on your behalf.” Cheng waved at him to stop. “ It’ s understandable. Poor child! Y ou’ve been so frightened. There are some comrades whose political awareness is not adeq uately h igh. Some members of the Construction Corps and some of the folks from the people’ s co urt employ such simplistic methods and behave so rudely . It’ s completely inappropriate! All right, W enjie, why don’ t you read the document? Read it carefully .” Y e picked up the document and flipped through it in the dim yellow light of the det ention cell. Representative Cheng hadn’ t lied to her . The document really had nothing to do with her case. It was about her father . In it was a record of her father ’ s interact ions and conversations with certain individuals. The source was W enjie’ s younger sister , W enxue. A s one of the most radical Red Guards, W enxue had always been proactive in exposing their father , and had composed numerous reports detailing his supposed sins. Some of the material she provided had ultimately led to his death. But Y e could tel l that this report didn’ t come from the hand of her sister . W enxue had an intense, impatient style. When you read her reports, each line wou ld make an explosive im pact, like a string of firecrack ers. But this document was composed in a cool, experienced, meticulous style. Who spoke to whom, when, where, what was discussedevery detail was recorded, down to the exact date. For someone who wasn’ t experienced, the contents seemed like a boring diary , but the calculating, cold purpose hidden within was very dif ferent from the childish antics of W enxue. Y e c ouldn’ t really understand what the document was getting at , but she could se nse that it had somethin g to do with an important national defense project. As the daughter of a physicist, Y e guessed that it was a reference to the double-bomb project8 that had shocked the world in 1964 and 1967.During this period of the Cultural Revolution, in order to bring down a highly p ositioned individual, it was necessary to gather evidence of his deficiencies in the various areas he was in char ge of. But for those plotting such political machinations, the double-bomb project p osed great dif ficulties. People in the highest levels of the government placed the project under their protection to avoid disruption by the Cultural Revolution. It was dif ficult for those with nefarious purposes to pry into its inner workings. Due to her father ’ s family background, he couldn’ t meet the political requirements an d did not work on the double-bomb project. All he had done was som e peripheral theoretical work for it. But it was easier to make use of him tha n those who had work ed at the core of the project. Y e W enjie couldn’ t tell if th e contents of the document were true or false, but she was sure that every character and e very punctuation mark had the potential to deliver a fatal po litical blow . In addition to those tar geted directly , countless others might have their fates altered because of this document. At the end of the document was her sister ’ s signature in lar ge characters, and Y e W enjie was supposed to sign as a witness. She noticed that three other witnesses had already signed. “I don’ t know anything about th ese conversations,” Y e said softly . She put the document back down. “How ca n you not know? Many of these conversations occurred right in your home. Y our sister knew them. Y ou must, too.” “I really don’ t.” “But these conversations really did occur . Y ou must have faith in us.” “I di dn’ t say they weren’ t true. But I really don’ t know about th em. So I can’ t sign.” “Y e W enjie!” Cheng’ s associate took a step closer . But Cheng stopped him again. She shifted to sit even closer to Y e and picked up one of her cold hands. “W enjie, let me put all my cards on the table. Y our case has a lot of prosecutorial discretion. On the one hand, we could minimize it as a case of an educated youth being fooled by a reactionary bookit’ s not a big deal. W e don ’ t even need to go thro ugh a judicial procedure. W e’ll have you attend a politica l class and writ e a few self-criticism reports, a nd then you can go back to the Construction Corps. On the other hand, we could alsoprosecute this case to its fullest extent. W enjie, you must know that you could be declared an active counter -revolutionary . “Now , fa ced with political cases like yours, all prosecutorial or gans and courts would rather be too sever e than too lax. This is because treating you too seve rely would just be a mistake in method, but treating yo u too laxly would be a mistake in political direction. Ultimately , however , the decision belongs to the military control commission. Of course, I’m tel ling you all this of f the record.” Cheng’ s associate added, “Representative Cheng is trying to save you. Three witnesses have already signed. Y our refusal to sign is pretty much meaningless. I must ur ge you not to be confused, Y e W enjie.” “Right, W enjie,” Cheng continued. “It would break my heart t o see an educated young person like you ruined by something like this. I really want to save you. Please cooperate. Look at me. Do you think I would hurt you?” But Y e did not look at Represe ntative Cheng. What she saw , instead, was her father ’ s blood. “Represe ntative Cheng, I have no knowledge of the events recorded in this document. I cannot sign it.” Cheng L ihua became quiet. She stared at Y e for a long while, and the cold air in the c ell seemed to solidify . Then she slowly put the document back into her briefcase and stood up. Her kind expression did not disappear , but was set on her face like a plaster mask. Still appearin g kind and af fectionate, she walked to the c orner of the cell, where there was a bucket for w ashing. She picked it up and poured half the water onto Y e and the other half onto her blanket, her movements never strayi ng from a methodical calmness. Then she dropped the bucket and left the cell, pausing only to mutter , “Y ou stubborn little bitch!” The hea d of the detention cente r was the last to leave. He stared coldly at Y e, soaked th rough and dripping, shut the cell door with a bang, and locked it. Through her wet clothes, the ch ill of the Inner Mongolian winter seized Y e like a giant’ s fist. She heard her teeth chatter , but eventual ly even that sound disappeared. The coldness penetrated into her bones, and the world in her eyes turned milky white. She felt that the entire universe was a huge block of ice, and she was the only spark of life within it. She was the little girl about to free ze to death, and she didn’ t even have a handful of matches, only illusions.…The bloc k of ice holding her gradually became transparent. In front of her she could see a tall building. At the top, a young girl waved a bright red banner . H er slen der figure contrasted vividly with the breadth o f the flag: It was her sister , W enxue. Ever since her little sister had made a clean break with her reactionary academic authority family , W enjie had heard no news about he r . She had only learned recently that W enxue had died two years ago in one of the wars between Red Guard factions. As Y e watched, the figure waving the flag became Bai Mu lin, his glasses reflectin g the flames raging below the building; then it turned into Representative Cheng; then her mother , Shao Lin; then her fathe r . The flag- bearer kept on changing, but the flag waved ceaselessly , like a perpetual pendulum, counting down the remainder of her short life. Gradually , the flag grew blurry; everything grew blurry . The ice that filled the universe once again se aled her at its center . Only this t ime, the ice was black."
中国科幻基石丛书 80 9．红岸之一 不知过了多长时间，叶文洁听到了沉重的轰鸣声。这声音来自所有 的方向，在她那模糊的意识中，似乎有某种巨大的机械在钻开或锯开她 置身于其中的大冰块。世界仍是一片黑暗，但轰鸣声却变得越来越真 实，她终于能够确定这声音的来源既不是天堂也不是地狱。她意识到自 己仍闭着眼睛，便努力地睁开沉重的眼皮首先看到了一盏灯，灯深 嵌在天花板内部，被罩在一层似乎是用于防撞击的铁丝网后面，发出昏 暗的光，天花板似乎是金属的。 她听到有个男声在轻轻叫自己的名字。 “你在发高烧。 ”那人说。 “这是哪儿？ ”叶文洁无力地问，感觉声音不是自己发出的。 “在飞机上。 ” 叶文洁感到一阵虚弱，又昏睡过去，朦胧中轰鸣声一直伴随着她。 时间不长，她再次清醒过来，这时麻木消失，痛苦的感觉出现了：头和四 肢的关节都很痛，嘴里呼出的气是发烫的，喉咙也痛，咽下一口唾沫感 觉像咽下一块火炭。 叶文洁转过头，看到旁边有两个穿着和程代表一样的军大衣的人，不 同的是他们都戴着有红五星的军棉帽，敞开的大衣露出了里面军服上的 红领章，其中一名军人戴着眼镜。叶文洁发现自己也盖着一件军大衣， 身上的衣服是干的，很暖和。 她吃力地想支起身，居然成功了。她看到了另一边的舷窗，窗外是 地球往事 三体 81 缓缓移去的滚滚云海，被阳光照得很刺眼；她赶紧收回目光，看到狭窄 的机舱中堆满了军绿色的铁箱子，从另一个舷窗中可以看到上方旋翼 的影子。她猜自己可能是在一架直升机上。 “还是躺下吧。 ”戴眼镜的军人说，扶她重新躺下，把大衣盖好。 “叶文洁，这篇论文是你写的吗？”另一名军人把一本翻开的英文 杂志伸到她眼前，她看到那文章的题目是《太阳辐射层内可能存在的 能量界面和其反射特性》 ，他把杂志的封面让她看，那是 1966 年的一 期《天体物理学杂志》 。 “肯定是的，这还用证实吗？ ”戴眼镜的军人拿走了杂志，然后介绍 说， “这位是红岸基地的雷志成政委。我是杨卫宁，基地的总工程师。离 降落还有一个小时，你休息吧。 ” 你是杨卫宁？叶文洁没有说出口，只是吃惊地看着他，发现他的表 情很平静，显然不想让旁人知道他们认识。杨卫宁曾是叶哲泰的一名研 究生，他毕业时叶文洁刚上大一。叶文洁现在还清楚地记得杨卫宁第一 次到家里来的情形，那时他刚考上研究生，与导师谈课题方向。杨卫宁 说他想搞倾向于实验和应用的课题，尽可能离基础理论远些。叶文洁记 得父亲当时是这样说：我不反对，但我们毕竟是理论物理专业，你这样 要求的理由呢？杨卫宁回答：我想投身于时代，做一些实际的贡献。父亲 说：理论是应用的基础，发现自然规律，难道不是对时代最大的贡献？杨 卫宁犹豫了一下，终于说出了真话：搞理论研究，容易在思想上犯错误。 这话让父亲沉默了。 杨卫宁是个很有才华的人，数学功底扎实，思维敏捷，但在不长的 研究生生涯中，他与导师的关系若即若离，他们相互之间保持着敬而远 之的距离。那时叶文洁与杨卫宁经常见面，也许是受父亲影响，叶文洁 没有过多地注意他，至于他是否注意过自己，叶文洁就不知道了。后来 杨卫宁顺利毕业，不久就与导师中断了联系。 叶文洁再次虚弱地闭上眼睛后，两名军人离开了她，到一排箱子后 面低声交谈。机舱很狭窄，叶文洁在引擎的轰鸣声中还是听到了他们的 中国科幻基石丛书 82 话 “我还是觉得这事儿不太稳妥。 ”这是雷志成的声音。 杨卫宁反问： “那你能从正常渠道给我需要的人吗？ ” “唉，我也费了很大劲。这种专业从军内找不到，从地方上找，问题 就更多了，你知道这项目的保密级别，首先得参军，更大的问题还是保 密条例要求的在基地的隔离工作周期。那么长时间，家属随军怎么办？ 也得到基地里，这谁都不愿意。找到的两个合适的候选人宁肯待在五七 干校也不来。当然可以硬调，但这种工作的性质，要是不安心什么都干 不出来的。 ” “所以只能这么办。 ” “可这也太违反常规了。 ” “这个项目本来就违反常规，出了事儿我负责就是了。 ” “我的杨总啊，这责你负得了吗？你一头钻在技术里， ‘红岸’可是 与其他国防重点项目不同，它的复杂，是复杂在技术之外的。 ” “你这倒是实话。 ” 降落时已是傍晚，叶文洁谢绝了杨卫宁和雷志成的挽扶，自己艰难 地走下飞机，一阵强风差点把她吹倒，风吹在仍转动的旋翼上，发出尖 利的啸声。风中的森林气息文洁很熟悉，她认识这风，这风也认识她，这 是大兴安岭的风。 她很快听到了另一种声音，一个低沉浑厚的嗡嗡声，浑厚而有力， 似乎构成了整个世界的背景，这是不远处抛物面天线在风中的声音，只 有到了跟前，才能真正感受到这张天网的巨大。叶文洁的人生在这一个 月里转了一个大圈又回来了她现在是在雷达峰上。 叶文洁不由得转头朝她的建设兵团连队所在的方向望去，只看到 暮色中一片迷蒙的林海。 直升机显然不是专为接她的，几名士兵走过来，从机舱里卸下那些 军绿色的货箱，他们从她身边走过，没人看她一眼。她和雷志成、杨卫宁 地球往事 三体 中国科幻基石丛书 84 一行三人继续向前走去，叶文洁发现雷达峰的峰顶是这样的宽阔，在天 线的下面有一小群白色建筑物，与天线相比，它们像几块精致的积木。 他们正朝有两名哨兵站岗的基地大门走去，走到门前，他们停了下来。 雷志成转向叶文洁，郑重地说： “叶文洁，你的反革命罪行证据确 凿，将要面临的审判也是罪有应得；现在，你面前有一个立功赎罪的机 会，你可以接受，也可以拒绝。 ”他向天线方向指了指， “这是一个国防 科研基地，其中正在进行的研究项目需要你掌握的专业知识，更具体 的，请杨总工程师为你介绍，你要慎重考虑。 ”说完他对杨卫宁点了点 头，尾随搬运物资的士兵一起走进了基地。 杨卫宁等别人走远了，向叶文洁示意了一下，带她走远些，显然是 怕哨兵听到下面的谈话。这时，他不再隐藏自己与她的相识： “叶文洁， 我可向你说清楚，这不是什么机会。我向法院军管会了解过，虽然程丽 华力主重判，但具体到你的情节，刑期最多也就是十年，考虑到可能的 减刑，也就是六七年的样子。而这里”他向基地方向偏了一下头， “是最高密级的研究项目，以你的身份，走进这道门，可能……”他停了 好一会儿，似乎想让天线在风中的轰鸣声加重自己的语气， “一辈子都 出不来了。 ” “我进去。 ”叶文洁轻声说。 杨卫宁对她这么快的回答很吃惊。 “你不必这么匆忙做决定， 可以 先回到飞机上去，它三小时后才起飞，你要是拒绝，我送你回去。 ” “我不回去，我们进去吧。 ”叶文洁的声音仍很轻，但其中有一种斩 钉截铁的坚定。现在除了死后不知是否存在的另一个世界，她最想去的 地方就是这样与世隔绝的峰顶了，在这里，她有一种久违的安全感。 “还是慎重些吧，你想清楚这意味着什么。 ” “我可以在这里待一辈子。 ” 杨卫宁低头沉默了，他看着远方，似乎强行给叶文洁一些思考权衡 的时间，叶文洁也沉默着，在风中裹紧军大衣看着远方，那里，大兴安岭 已消失在浓浓的夜色中。在严寒下不可能有很多时间，杨卫宁下决心起 地球往事 三体 85 步走向大门，走得很快，像要把叶文洁甩掉似的，但叶文洁紧跟着他，走 进了红岸基地的大门。两名哨兵在他们通过后关上了两扇沉重的铁门。 走了一段后，杨卫宁站住，指着天线对文洁说： “这是一个大型武 器研究项目，如果成功，其意义可能比原子弹和氢弹都大。 ” 在路过基地内最大的一幢建筑时，杨卫宁径直过去推开了门，叶文 洁在门口看到了“发射主控室”的字样，迈进门，一股带着机油味的热 气迎面扑来，她看到宽敞的大厅中，密集地摆放着各类仪器设备，信号 灯和示波仪上的发光图形闪成一片，十多名穿军装的操作人员坐在几 乎将他们埋没的一排排仪器前，仿佛是蹲守在深深的战壕中。操作口令 此起彼伏，显得紧张而混乱。 “这里暖和些，你先等一会儿，我去安排好 你的住处就来。 ” 杨卫宁对叶文洁说， 并指指门旁边一张桌子旁的椅子 让她坐。叶文洁看到，那张桌前已经坐了一个人，那是一位带手枪的卫 兵。 “我还是在外面等吧。 ”叶文洁停住脚步说。 杨卫宁和善地笑笑， “你以后就是基地的工作人员了， 除了少数地 方，你哪里都可以去。 ”说完，他脸上有一种不安的表情，显然意识到了 这话另一层的意思：你再也不能离开这里了。 “我还是去外面吧。 ”叶文洁坚持说。 “那……好吧。 ” 杨卫宁看看那位并没有注意他们的卫兵， 似乎理 解了叶文洁，带她走出主控室， “你到这个避风的地方，我几分钟就回 来，主要是找人给那个房间生上火，基地的条件现在还不太好，没有暖 气。 ”说完快步走去。 叶文洁站在主控室的门边，巨大的天线就竖立在她身后，整整占据 了半个夜空。在这里，她能够清楚地听到里面传出的声音。突然，那纷乱 的操作口令声消失了，主控室里一片寂静，只能隐约听到仪器设备偶尔 发出的蜂鸣声，接着出现了一个压倒一切的男音： “中国人民解放军第二炮兵，红岸工程第 147 次常规发射，授权确 认完毕， 30秒倒数！ ” 中国科幻基石丛书 86 “目标类别：甲三；坐标序号： BN20197F ；定位校核完毕， 25秒倒 数！ ” “发射文档号： 22； 附加： 无； 续传： 无； 文档最后校核完毕， 20秒倒 数！ ” “能源单元报告，正常！ ” “编码单元报告：正常！ ” “功放单元报告：正常！ ” “干扰监测报告：在许可范围！ ” “程序不可逆， 15秒倒数！ ” 一切又安静下来，十几秒钟后，随着一个警铃声响起，天线上的一 盏红灯急剧闪烁起来。 “发射启动！各单元注意监测！ ” 叶文洁感到脸上有轻微的瘙痒感，她知道一个巨大的电场出现了。 她仰头顺着天线所指的方向望去，看到夜空中的一缕薄云发出幽幽蓝 光，那光很微弱，最初她以为是自己的幻觉，但当那缕云飘离那片空域 后，云的微光就消失了，另外一缕飘入的云也同样发出光来。在主控室 中，口令声又响成一片，她只能隐约听出其中的几句： “功放单元故障， 3号磁控电子管烧毁！ ” “冗余单元投入正常！ ” “断点 l，续传正常！ ” …… 叶文洁听到另外一种“呼啦啦”的声音，朦胧中，看到一片片黑影 从山下的密林中出现，盘旋着升上夜空，她没想到严冬的森林中还有这 么多的鸟儿被惊起。接着她目睹了恐怖的一幕：一个鸟群飞进了天线指 向的范围，以发出幽光的那缕云为背景，她清楚地看到了群鸟纷纷从空 中坠落。 这一过程大约持续了十五分钟，天线上的红灯熄灭了，叶文洁皮肤 上的瘙痒感也消失了，主控室中，纷乱的口令声依旧，即使在那个洪亮 地球往事 三体 87 的男音响起后也没有停止。 “红岸工程第 147 次发射进行完毕，发射系统关闭，红岸进入监测 状态，请监测部接过系统控制权，并上传断点数据。 ” “请各单元组认真填写发射日志，各组长到会议室参加发射例会， 完毕。 ” 一切都沉寂下来，只有天线在风中发出的混响依旧。叶文洁看着夜 空中的鸟群纷纷落回森林中。她再次仰望天线，感觉它像一只向苍穹张 开的巨大手掌，拥有一种超凡脱俗的力量。她向“手掌”对着的夜空看 去，并没有看到已被它打击的 BN20197F 号目标，在稀疏的云缕后面， 只有 1969 年寒冷的星空。,"3 R e d C o a s t I Y e W enjie heard a loud, continuous roar . She didn’ t know how much time had passed. The noise came from all around her . In her vague state of consciousness, it seeme d as though some gigantic machine was drilling into or sawing through the block of ice that held her . The world was still only darkness, but the noise grew more and more real. Finally , she was certain that the source of th e noise was neither heaven nor hell, and she remained in the land of the living. She real ized that her eyes were still closed. W ith an ef fort, she lifted her eyelids. The first thing she saw was a light embedded deeply in the ceiling. Covered by a wire mesh that seemed designed to protect it, it em itted a dim glow . The ceiling appeared to be made of metal. She heard a m ale voice softly calling her name. “Y ou have a high fever ,” the man said. “Where am I?” W enjie’ s voice w as so weak that she couldn’ t be sure it was her own. “On a helicopter .” Y e felt weak. She fell back to sleep. As she dozed, the roar kept her company . Before long, she woke again. Now the numbness had disappeared and the pain rea sserted itself: Her head and the joints of her l imbs ached, and the breath c oming out of he r mouth felt scalding hot. Her throat hurt so much that swallowing spittle felt like it was a piece of burning coal.She turned her h ead and saw two men wearing the same kind of military coat that Repres entative Cheng had worn. But unlike her , both of these men had on the cotton cap of the PLA, a red star sewn onto the front. Their coats were unbuttoned, and she could see the red-collar insignia on their army uniforms. One of the men wore glasses. Y e d iscovered that she was covered by a military coat as w ell. The clothes she was wearing were dry and warm. She stru ggled to sit up, and to her surprise, succeeded. She looked out the porthole on the other side. Rolling clouds slowly drifted by , reflecting the dazzling sunlight. She pulled her gaze back. The narrow cabin was filled w ith iron trunks painted military green. From another porthole she could see flickering shadows cast by the rotors. She was indeed on a helicopter . “Y ou’d better lie back down,” the man with the glasses said. He helped her down and covered her with the coat again. “Y e W enjie, did you write this paper?” The other man extended an open English journal before her eyes. The title of the paper was “The Possible Existence of Phase Boundaries W ithin the Solar Radiation Zon e and Their Reflective Char acteristics.” He showed her the cover of the journal: an issue of The Journal of Astr ophysics from 1966. “Of cou rse she did. Why does that even need to be confirme d?” The man wearing glasses took the j ournal away and then made in troductions. “This is Political Commissar Lei Zhicheng of Red Coast Base. I’m Y ang W eining, base chief engineer . It will be an hour before we land . Y ou might as well get some rest.” Y ou’r e Y ang W eining? Y e didn’ t say an ything, but she was stunned. She saw that he kept his expression calm, apparently not wishing to let anyone else know that they knew each other . Y ang had been one of Y e Zhetai’ s graduate students. By the time he had obtained his degree, W enjie was still a first-year in college. She cou ld clearl y remember the first time Y ang came to her ho me. He had just begun his graduate studies and needed to discuss the direction of his research with Professor Y e . Y ang said that he wanted to focus on experimental and applied problems, staying away from theory . Y e W enjie recalled her father saying, “I’m not opposed to your i dea. But we a re, after all, the department of theoretical physics. Why do you want toavoid theory?” Y ang replied, “I want to devote myself to the times, to make so me real- world contributions.” Her father said, “Theory is the foundation of application. Isn’ t discovering fundamental laws the biggest contribution to our time?” Y ang hesitated and finally revea led his real concern: “It’ s easy to make ideological mistakes in theory .” Her father had nothing to say to that. Y ang w as very talented, with a good mathematical foundation and a quick mind. But during his brief time as a graduate student, he always kept a respec table distance from his thesis advisor . Y e W enjie had seen Y ang several times, but, perhaps due to the influence of her father , she hadn’ t noticed him much. As for whet her he had paid much attention to her , she had no idea. After Y ang got his degree, he soon ceased all contact with her father . Again feeling weak, Y e closed her eyes. The two men left her and crouched behind a row of trunks to converse in lowered voices. But the cabin was so cr amped that Y e could hear them even over the roar of the engine. “I still think this isn’ t a good idea,” Commissar Lei said. “Can yo u find the personnel I need through normal channels ?” Y ang asked. “Eh. I’ve done all I can. There’ s no one in the military with this specialization, and going outside the army raises many questions. Y ou know very we ll that the security cl earance needed for this project requires someone willing to join the army . But the bigger issue is the requirement in the secu rity regulations that they be sequestered at the base for extended periods. What’ s to be done if the y have families? Sequester them at the base too? No one would agree to that. I did find two possible candidates, but both wo uld rath er stay at the May Seventh Cadre Schools rathe r than come here.9 Of course we could forcefully move them. But given the nature of this work, we can’ t have someone who doesn’ t want to be here.” “Then there’ s no choice but to use her .” “But it’ s so unconventional.”“This en tire project is unconventional. If something goes wrong, I’ll accept the responsibility .” “Chief Y ang, do you really thin k you can take responsibility for this? Y ou are a technical person, but Red Coast is not like other natio nal defense projects. Its complexity goes far beyond the technical issues.” “Y ou’re right, but I only know how to solve the technical issues.” * * * By the time they landed, it was dusk. Y e refused to be helped by Y ang and Lei, and struggled ou t of the helicopter by herself. A strong gust of wind almost blew her over . The still- gyrating rotors sliced through the wind, making a loud whistling noise. The scent of the woods on the wind was familiar to her , and she was familiar to the wind. It was the wind of the Greater Khingan Mountains. She soo n heard another sound, a kind of low , forceful, bass h owl that seemed to form the background of the world: the parabolic antenna dish in the wind. Only now , when she was so close to it, did she fin ally feel its immensity . Y e’ s life had made a big circle this month: She was now on top of Radar Peak. She couldn’ t help but look in t he direction of her Construction Corps company . But all she could see was a misty sea of trees in the twilight. The heli copter was carrying more than just Y e. Several soldiers came over and began to unload military-green car go trunks from the cabin. They walked by without glancing at her . As she followed Y ang and Lei, Y e noticed that the top of Radar Peak was spacious. A cluster of white buildings, like delicate toy block s, nestled under the giant anten na. The trio headed toward the base gate, fla nked by two guards, and stopped in front of it. Lei turn ed to her and spoke sole mnly . “Y e W enjie, the evidence of your counter -revolutionary crime is incontrovertible, and the court would have punished you as you deserve. But now you have an opportunity to redeem yourself through hard work. Y ou can accept it or refuse it.” H e pointed at the antenna. “This is a defense research facility . The research conducted here nee ds your specialized scientific knowledge. Chief Engine er Y ang can give you the details, which you should consider carefully .”He n odded at Y a ng and then en tered the gate after the soldiers carrying the trunks. Y ang w aited until the others w ere gone and indicated that Y e should follow him a lit tle distance away from the gate, clearly trying to avoid the sentries listening in. He no longer pretended that he didn’ t know her . “W enjie, let me be clear . Th is is not some great opp ortunity . I learned from the mili tary control commission at the court that al though Cheng Lihua advocates sentencing you severely , the most that you ’ll get is ten years. Considering mitigating circumstances, you’ll serve m aybe six or seven years. But here”he nodded in the direction of the base“is a research project under the highest security classification. Given your status, if you enter the gate, it’ s possible ” He paused, as though wantin g to let the bass howl of the antenna add to the weight of his words. “you’ll never leave for the rest of your life.” “I want to go in.” Y ang was surprised by her quick answer . “Don’ t be hasty . Get back onto the helicopter . It will take of f in three hours, and if you refuse our of fer , it will take you back.” “I don’ t want to go back. Let’ s go in.” Y e’ s voice remained soft, but there wa s a determination in her tone that was harder than steel. Other than the und iscovered country bey ond death from which no one has ever returned, the place she wanted to be the most was this peak, separated from the rest of the w orld. Here, she felt a sense of security that had long eluded her . “Y ou should be cautious. Think through what this decision means.” “I can stay here for the rest of my life.” Y ang low ered hi s head and said nothing. He stared into the distance, as though forcing Y e to sort throug h her thoughts. Y e stayed silent as well. She pulled h er coat tightly around herself and gazed into the distance. There, the Greater Khingan Mountains were fading into the darkening night. It was impossible to stay out here much longer in the cold. Y ang began to w alk toward the gate. He moved fast, as though trying to leave Y e behind. But Y e stayed close. After they entered the gate of Red Coast Base, the two sentries shut the heavy iron doors. A li ttle ways on, Y ang stopped and pointed at the antenna. “T his is a lar ge-scale weap ons research project. If it succeeds, the result w ill be evenmore important than the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb.” They ca me to the lar gest building in the base, and Y ang pushed the door open. Y e saw the words TRANSMISSION MAIN CONTROL ROOM over the door . Inside, w arm air tinged with the smell of engine oil enveloped h er . She saw that the spacious room was filled with all kinds of instru ments and equipment. Signal lights and oscilloscope displays flickered together . A dozen or so operators dressed in military uniform were almost entombed by the rows of instruments, as tho ugh they were crouching inside battlefield trenches. The unceasing stream of operational orders and responses gave the whole scene a tense, confusing feel. “It’ s war mer in here,” Y ang said . “W ait here a bit. I’ll take care of your living arrangements and return for you.” He pointed at a chair and desk next to the door . Y e saw that som eone was already sitting at the desk: a guard carrying a handgun. “I’d rather wait outside,” Y e said. Y ang smiled at her kindly . “From now on, you’ll be a member of the base staf f. Other than a few sensitive areas, you can go anywhere you want.” His face suddenly looked uncomfortable as he realized a nother layer of meaning to his words: Y ou can never leave her e again. “I prefer to wait outside,” Y e insisted. “All righ t.” Y ang glanced at the guard at the desk, who paid no attention to them. He seemed to understan d Y e’ s concern and brought her back out of the main control room. “Stand somewhere out of the wind, and I’ll be back in a few minutes. I just need to get someone to start a fire in your room conditions at the base are a bit rough, and we have no heating system.” Y e stood next to the main control room door . The huge antenna was directly behind her and it blott ed out half the sky . From here, she could clearly hear the sounds inside th e main control room. Suddenly , the chaotic orders and responses ceased, an d the room became completely quiet. All she could hear was the occasional low buzzing noise from some instrument. Then a loud m ale voice broke the silence. “The People’ s Li beration Army , S econd A rtillery Corps,10 R ed Coast Proj ect, one hundred and forty- seventh transmission. Authorization confirmed. Begin thirty-second countdown.”“T ar get Classific ation: A-three. Coordinates’ serial number: BN 20197F . Position checked and confirmed. T wenty-five seconds.” “T ransmission file number: twenty-two. Additions: none. Continuations: none. T ransmission file final check completed. T wenty seconds.” “Ener gy Unit reporting: all systems go.” “Coding Unit reporting: all systems go.” “Amplifier Unit reporting: all systems go.” “Interference Monitoring Unit reporting: within acceptable range.” “W e have reached the point of no return. Fifteen seconds.” Everything became quiet again. Fifteen seconds later , as a klaxon started to blare, a red light on top of the antenna began to blink rapidly . “Begin transmission! All units continue to monitor!” Y e felt a light itch on her face. She knew that an enormous electric field had appeared. She lifted her face and gazed in the direction the antenna was pointing and saw a cloud in the night sky glow with a dim blue light, so dim that at first she thought it an i llusion. But as the cloud drifte d away , the glow disappeared. Another clou d that drifted into position began to give of f the same glow . From the main control room, she heard more shouts. “Malfunction with Ener gy Unit. Magnetron number three has burnt out.” “Backup Unit is in operation: all systems go.” “Checkpoint one reached. Resuming transmission.” Y e heard a fluttering noise. Through the mist, she could see shadows lift out of the woods below the peak and spiral into the dark sky . She hadn’ t realized so many birds could be roused from the woods in d eep winter . Then she saw a terrifying scene : One flock of birds flew into the region of air the antenna pointed at, and against the background of the faintly glowing cloud, the birds dropped out of the sky . The process continued for abou t fifteen minutes. Then the red light on the a ntenna went out, and the it ch on her skin disappeared. From the main control room, the confusing murmur of orders and responses resumed even as the loud male voice continued. “T ransmission one hundred forty-seven of Red Coast com pleted. T ransmission systems shutting down. Red Coast now entering monitoringstate. System control is hereby transferred to the Monitoring Department. Please upload checkpoint data.” “All units should fill out trans mission diaries. All unit heads should attend the post-transmission meeting in the debriefing room. W e’re done.” All was silent except for the howl of the wind against the antenna. Y e watched as the r emaining birds in the flock gradually settled back into the forest. S he stare d at the antenn a and thought it looked like an enormous hand stretched open toward the sky , possessing an ethereal stren gth. As she surveyed the night sky , she did n ot see any tar get that she thought might be serial number BN20197F . Beyond the wisps of clouds, all she could see were the stars of a cold night in 1969."
地球往事 三体 1 1．科学边界 汪淼觉得，来找他的这四个人是一个奇怪的组合：两名警察和两名 军人，如果那两个军人是武警还算正常，但这是两名陆军军官。 汪淼第一眼就对来找他的警察没有好感。其实那名穿警服的年轻 人还行，举止很有礼貌，但那位便衣就让人讨厌了。这人长得五大三粗， 一脸横肉，穿着件脏兮兮的皮夹克，浑身烟味，说话粗声大嗓，是最令汪 淼反感的那类人。 “汪淼？”那人问，直呼其名令汪淼很不舒服，况且那人同时还在点 烟，头都不抬一下。不等汪淼回答，他就向旁边那位年轻人示意了一下， 后者向汪淼出示了警官证，他点完烟后就直接向屋里闯。 “请不要在我家里抽烟。 ”汪淼拦住了他。 “哦，对不起，汪教授。这是我们史强队长。 ”年轻警官微笑着说，同 时对姓史的使了个眼色。 “成，那就在楼道里说吧。 ”史强说着，深深地吸了一大口，手中的 烟几乎燃下去一半，之后竟不见吐出烟来。 “你问。 ”他又向年轻警官偏 了一下头。 “汪教授，我们是想了解一下，最近你与‘科学边界’学会的成员 有过接触，是吧？ ” “ ‘科学边界’是一个在国际学术界很有影响的学术组织，成员都是 著名学者。这样一个合法的学术组织，我怎么就不能接触了呢？ ” “你看看你这个人！ ”史强大声说， “我们说它不合法了吗？我们说 不让你接触了吗？ ”他说着，刚才吸进肚子里的烟都喷到汪淼脸上。 中国科幻基石丛书 2 “那好，这属于个人隐私，我没必要回答你们的问题。 ” “还啥都成隐私了，像你这样一个著名学者，总该对公共安全负责 吧。 ”史强把手中的烟头扔掉，又从压扁了的烟盒里抽出一根。 “我有权不回答，你们请便吧。 ”汪淼说着要转身回屋。 “等等！ ”史强厉声说，同时朝旁边的年轻警官挥了一下手， “给他 地址和电话，下午去走一趟。 ” “你要干什么！ ”汪淼愤怒地质问，这争吵引得邻居们也探出头来， 想看看出了什么事。 “史队！你说你”年轻警官生气地将史强拉到一边，显然他的 粗俗不止是让汪淼一人不适应。 “汪教授，请别误会。 ”一名少校军官急忙上前， “下午有一个重要 会议，要请几位学者和专家参加，首长让我们来邀请您。 ” “我下午很忙。 ” “这我们清楚，首长已经向超导中心领导打了招呼。这次会议上不 能没有您，实在不行，我们只有把会议延期等您了。 ” 史强和他的同事没再说话，转身下楼了，两位军官看着他们走远， 似乎都长出了一口气。 “这人怎么这样儿。 ”少校小声对同事说。 “他劣迹斑斑，前几年在一次劫持人质事件中，他不顾人质的死活 擅自行动，结果导致一家三口惨死在罪犯手中；据说他还和黑社会打得 火热，用一帮黑道势力去收拾另一帮；去年又搞刑讯逼供，使一名嫌疑 人致残，因此被停职了……” “这种人怎么能进作战中心？ ” “首长点名要他，应该有什么过人之处吧。不过，对他限制挺严，除 了公安方面的事务，几乎什么都不让他知道。 ” 作战中心？那是什么？汪淼不解地看着面前的两位军官。 接汪淼的汽车驶进了城市近郊的一座大院，从那只有门牌号码没 地球往事 三体 3 有单位名牌的大门，汪淼知道这里是军方而不是警方的地盘。 会议是在一个大厅里举行的，汪淼一进去就对这里的纷乱吃惊不 小。大厅周围是一圈胡乱安放的电脑设备，有的桌子上放不下就直接搁 地板上，电线和网线纠缠着散在地上；一大摞网络交换机没有安在机架 内，而是随手堆放在服务器上；有好几个投影仪的大屏幕，在大厅的角 落里呈不同角度随意立着，像吉普赛人的帐篷；烟雾像晨雾般在半空浮 了一层……汪淼不知道这是否就是那名军官所说的作战中心，有一点 他可以肯定：这里在处理的事情，已经让人们顾不上其他了。 临时拼凑的会议桌上也是堆满了文件和杂物，与会者大多神情疲 惫，衣服皱巴巴的，有领带的都扯开了，好像熬了一夜。主持会议的是一 位叫常伟思的陆军少将，与会者有一半是军人。经过简单的介绍，他知 道还有少部分警方人员，其他的人都是和他一样参加会议的专家学者， 其中有几位还是很有名望的科学家，而且是研究基础科学的。 令他感到意外的是还有四个外国人，这些人的身份令他大吃一惊： 其中的两个人也是军人，分别是美军空军上校和英国陆军上校，职务是 北约联络员；另外两人居然是美国中央情报局的官员，在这里的职务是 什么观察员。 从所有人的脸上，汪淼都读出了一句话：我们已经尽力了，快他妈 的结束吧！ 汪淼看到了史强，他倒是一反昨天的粗鲁，向汪淼打招呼，但那一 脸傻笑让汪淼愉快不起来。他不想挨史强坐，但也只有那一个空位，他 只好坐过去，屋里本来已经很浓的烟味更加重了。 发文件时，史强凑近汪淼说： “汪教授，你好像是在研究什么…… 新材料？ ” “纳米材料。 ”汪淼简单地回答。 “我听说过，那玩意儿强度很高，不会被用于犯罪吧？”从史强那带 有一半调侃的表情上，汪淼看不出他是不是开玩笑。 “什么意思？ ” 中国科幻基石丛书 4 “呵，听说那玩意儿一根头发丝粗就能吊起一辆大卡车，犯罪分子 要是偷点儿去做把刀，那一刀就能把一辆汽车砍成两截吧。 ” “哼，根本不用做成刀，用那种材料做一根只有头发丝百分之一粗 细的线，拦在路上，就能把过往的汽车像切奶酪那样切成两半……啥不 能用于犯罪？刮鱼鳞的刀都能！ ” 史强把面前的文件从袋中抽出一半又塞了回去，显然没了兴趣。 “说得对，鱼都能犯罪呢！我办过一个杀人案，一个娘们儿把她丈夫的 那玩意儿割下来了。知道用的是什么？冰箱里冷冻的罗非鱼！鱼冻硬后， 背上的那排刺就跟一把快刀似的……” “我没兴趣，怎么，让我来开会就是为这事儿？ ” “鱼？纳米材料？不、不，与那些都没关系。 ”史强把嘴凑到汪淼耳 边， “别给这帮家伙好脸，他们歧视咱们，只想从咱们这里掏情报，但什 么都不告诉咱们。像我，在这儿混了一个多月，还和你一样什么都不知 道。 ” “同志们，会议开始。 ”常伟思将军说， “在全球各战区，我们这里 现在成为焦点。首先把当前情况向与会的同志们介绍一下。 ” “战区”这个不寻常的术语令汪淼迷惑，他还注意到，首长好像并 没有打算向他这样的新人介绍来龙去脉，这倒是印证了史强的话。在常 将军这简短的开场白中，他两次提到了“同志们” ，汪淼看看对面的两 名北约军人和两个美国中情局官员，感觉将军似乎漏掉了“先生们” 。 “他们也是同志，反正这边的人都是这么称呼的。 ”史强低声地对汪 淼说，同时用手中的烟指了指那四个外国人。 在迷惑的同时，汪淼对史强的观察力留下了些印象。 “大史，你把烟熄了，这儿的烟味够浓了。 ”常伟思说，低头翻着文 件。 史强拿着刚点着的烟四下看看，没找到烟灰缸，就“吱啦”一声扔 到茶杯里了。他抓住这个机会举手要求发言，没等常伟思表态就大声说 道： “首长，我提个要求，以前提过的信息对等！ ” 地球往事 三体 5 常伟思将军抬起头， “没有任何一个军事行动是信息对等的，这点 也请到会的专家学者们谅解，我们不可能给你们介绍更多的背景资 料。” “但我们不一样。 ”史强说， “警方从作战中心成立之初就一直参 与，可直到现在，我们连这个机构到底是干什么的都不知道。而且，你们 正在把警方排挤出去，你们一步步熟悉我们的工作，然后把我们一个个 赶走。 ” 与会的另外几名警官都在低声制止史强。史强敢对常伟思这样级 别的首长这么说话，汪淼有些吃惊，而后者的反击更犀利。 “我说大史，现在看来，你在部队上的老毛病还没改。你能代表警 方吗？你因为自己的恶劣行为已被停职好几个月了，马上就要被清除出 公安队伍。我调你来，是看重你在城市警务方面的经验，你要珍惜这次 机会。 ” 大史用粗嗓门说： “那我是戴罪立功了？你们不是说那都是些歪门 邪道的经验吗？ ” “但有用。 ”常伟思对史强点点头， “有用就行，现在顾不了那么多 了，这是战争时期。 ” “什么都顾不了了， ”一位 CIA 的情报官员用标准的普通话说， “我们不能再用常规思维。 ” 那位英军上校显然也能听懂中文，他点点头， “To be or not to be ……” “他说什么？ ”史强问汪淼。 “没什么。 ”汪淼机械地回答。这些人似乎在梦呓，战争时期？战争 在哪儿？他扭头望向大厅的落地窗，透过窗子可以看到远处大院外面的 城市：春天的阳光下，街道上车流如织；草坪上有人在遛狗，还有几个孩 子在玩耍…… 里面和外面的世界，哪个更真实？ 常将军讲道： “最近，敌人的攻击明显加强了，目标仍是科学界高 中国科幻基石丛书 6 层，请你们先看一下文件中的那份名单。 ” 汪淼抽出文件中最上面的那张纸，是用大号字打印的，名单显然拟 得很仓促，中文和英文姓名都有。 “汪教授，看到这份名单，您有什么印象？ ”常伟思看着汪淼问。 “我知道其中的三人，都是物理学最前沿的著名学者。 ”汪淼答道， 有些心不在焉，他的目光锁定在最后一个名字上，在他的潜意识中，那 两个字的色彩与上面几行字是不同的。怎么会在这里看到她的名字？她 怎么了？ “认识？ ”大史用一根被烟熏黄的粗指头指着文件上的那个名字 问，见汪淼没有反应，他迅速做出反应，道： “呵，不太认识。想认识？ ” 现在，汪淼知道常伟思把他以前的这个战士调来是有道理的，这个 外表粗俗的家伙，眼睛跟刀子一样。他也许不是个好警察，但确实是个 狠角色。 那是一年前，汪淼是“中华二号”高能加速器项目纳米构件部分的 负责人。那天下午在良湘的工地上，一次短暂的休息中，他突然被眼前 的一幅构图吸引了。作为一名风景摄影爱好者，现实的场景经常在他眼 中形成一幅幅艺术构图。构图的主体就是他们正在安装的超导线圈，那 线圈有三层楼高，安装到一半，看上去是一个由巨大的金属块和乱麻般 的超低温制冷剂管道组成的怪物，仿佛一堆大工业时代的垃圾，显示出 一种非人性的技术的冷酷和钢铁的野蛮。就在这金属巨怪前面，出现了 一个年轻女性纤细的身影。这构图的光线分布也很绝：金属巨怪淹没在 临时施工顶棚的阴影里，更透出那冷峻、粗糙的质感；而一束夕阳金色 的光，透过顶棚的孔洞正好投在那个身影上，柔和的暖光照着她那柔顺 的头发，照着工作服领口上白皙的脖颈，看上去就像一场狂暴的雷雨 后，巨大的金属废墟上开出了一朵娇柔的花…… “看什么看，干活儿！ ” 汪淼吓了一跳，然后发现纳米研究中心主任说的不是他，而是一名 地球往事 三体 7 年轻工程师，后者也和自己一样呆呆地望着那个身影。汪淼从艺术中回 到现实，发现那位女性不是一般的工作人员，因为总工程师陪同着她， 在向她介绍着什么，一副很尊敬的样子。 “她是谁？ ”汪淼问主任。 “你应该知道她的， ”主任说，用手划了一大圈， “这个投资二百亿 的加速器建成后，第一次运行的可能就是验证她提出的一个超弦模型。 要说在论资排辈的理论研究圈子，本来轮不到她的，可那些老家伙不敢 先来，怕丢人，就让她捡了个便宜。 ” “什么？杨冬是……女的？ ！ ” “是的，我们也是在前天见到她时才知道。 ”主任说。 那名工程师问： “她这人是不是有什么心理障碍， 要不怎么会从来 不上媒体呢？别像是钱钟书似的，到死大家也没能在电视上看上一 眼。” “可我们也不至于不知道钱钟书的性别吧？我觉得她童年一定有 什么不寻常的经历，以致得了自闭症。 ”汪淼说，多少有一些酸葡萄心 理。 杨冬和总工程师走过来，在经过时她对他们微笑着点点头，没说一 句话，但汪淼记住了她那清澈的眼睛。 当天晚上汪淼坐在书房里，欣赏着挂在墙上的自己最得意的几幅 风景摄影，他的目光落在一幅塞外风光上那是一个荒凉的山谷，雪 山从山谷的尽头露出一抹白；山谷的这一端，半截沧桑的枯木占据了几 乎三分之一的画面。汪淼在想象中把那个萦绕在他脑海中的身影叠印 到画面上，让她位于山谷的深处，看去很小很小；这时汪淼惊奇地发现， 整个画面苏醒过来，仿佛照片中的世界认出了那个身影，仿佛这一切本 来就是为她而存在。他又依次在想象中将那个身影叠印到另外几幅作 品上，有时还将她那双眼睛作为照片上空旷苍穹的背景，那些画面也都 苏醒过来，展现出一种汪淼从未想象过的美。以前，汪淼总觉得自己的 摄影作品缺少某种灵魂；现在他知道了，缺的是她。 中国科幻基石丛书 8 “名单上的这些物理学家，在不到两个月的时间里，先后自杀。 ”常 伟思说。 晴天霹雳，汪淼的大脑一片空白。后来这空白中渐渐有了图像，那 是他那些黑白风景照片，照片中的大地没有了她的身影，天空抹去了她 的眼睛，那些世界死了。 “是……什么时候？ ”汪淼呆呆地问。 “在不到两个月的时间里。 ”常将军重复道。 “你是指最后一位吧。 ” 坐在汪淼旁边的大史得意地说， 然后压低 声音， “她是最后一位自杀者，前天晚上，服过量安眠药。她死得很顺 溜，没有痛苦。 ” 刹那间，汪淼居然对大史有了那么一丝感激。 “为什么？”汪淼问，那些照片上死去的风景画仍在他的脑海中幻 灯似的循环浮现。 常伟思回答道： “现在能肯定的只有一点：促使他们自杀的原因是相 同的。但原因本身在这里很难说清，也可能对我们这些非专业人士根 本就说不清。文件中附加了他们遗书的部分内容，各位会后可以仔细看 看。 ” 汪淼翻翻那些遗书的复印件，都是长篇大论。 “丁仪博士，您能否把杨冬的遗书给汪教授看一下？她的最简短， 也最有概括性。 ” 那个一直低着头沉默的人半天才有所反应，掏出一个白色的信封 隔着桌子递给汪淼，大史在旁边低声说： “他是杨冬的男友。 ”汪淼这才 想起自己在良湘的高能加速器工地中也见过丁仪，他是理论组的成员， 这名物理学家因在对球状闪电 ① 的研究中发现宏原子而闻名于世。汪淼 从信封中抽出一片散发出清香的东西，形状不规则，不是纸，竟是一片 白桦树皮，上面有一行娟秀的字： ①此处参见作者 2004年出版的《球状闪电》 。 地球往事 三体 9 一切的一切都导向这样一个结果：物理学从来就没有存在过，将来 也不会存在。我知道自己这样做是不负责任的，但别无选择。 连签字都没有，她就走了。 “物理学……不存在？ ”汪淼茫然四顾。 常将军合上文件夹， “有一些相关的具体信息与世界上三台新的 高能加速器建成后取得的实验结果有关，很专业，我们就不在这里讨论 了。我们首先要调查的是‘科学边界’学会。联合国教科文组织将 2005 年定为世界物理年，这个组织就是在这一年国际物理学界频繁的学术 会议和交流活动中逐渐诞生的，是一个松散的国际性学术组织。丁博 士，您是理论物理专业的，能进一步介绍一下它的情况吗？ ” 丁仪点点头说： “我与‘科学边界’没有任何直接联系，不过这个 组织在学术界很有名。它的宗旨是：自上个世纪下半叶以来，物理学古 典理论中的简洁有力渐渐消失了，理论图像变得越来越复杂、模糊和不 确定，实验验证也越来越难，这标志着物理学的前沿探索似乎遇到了很 大的障碍和困难。 ‘科学边界’试图开辟一条新的思维途径，简单地说 就是试图用科学的方法找出科学的局限性，试图确定科学对自然界的 认知在深度和精度上是否存在一条底线底线之下是科学进入不了 的。现代物理学的发展，似乎隐隐约约地触到了这条底线。 ” “很好。 ”常伟思说， “据我们了解，这些自杀的学者大部分与‘科 学边界’有过联系，有些还是它的成员。但没有发现诸如邪教精神控制 或使用违法药物这类的犯罪行为。也就是说，即使‘科学边界’对那些 学者产生过影响，也是通过合法的学术交流途径。汪教授，他们最近与 您有联系，我们想了解一些情况。 ” 大史粗声粗气地开口说： “包括联系人的姓名、见面地点和时间、 谈话内容，如果交换过文字资料或电子邮件的话……” “大史！ ”常伟思厉声制止了他。 “不吱声没人拿你当哑巴！ ”旁边一位警官探过身去对大史低声 说，后者拿起桌上的茶杯，看到里面的烟头后， “咚”的一声又放下了。 中国科幻基石丛书 10 大史又令汪淼像吃了苍蝇一样难受，刚才那一丝感激消失得无影 无踪。但他还是克制着回答了这个问题： “我与‘科学边界’的接触是 从认识申玉菲开始的，她是一名日籍华裔物理学家，现在为一家日资公 司工作，就住在这个城市。她曾在三菱电机的一家实验室从事纳米材料 研究，我们是在今年年初的一次技术研讨会上认识的。通过她，又认识 了几位物理专业的朋友，都是‘科学边界’的成员，国内国外的都有。和 他们交往时，谈的都是一些很……怎么说呢，很终极的问题，主要就 是丁博士刚才提到的科学底线的问题。 “我一开始对这些问题没有太大的兴趣，只是作为消遣。我是搞应 用研究的，在这方面水平不高，主要是听他们讨论和争论。这些人思想 都很深刻，观点新颖，自己感觉同他们交流，思想开阔了许多，渐渐变得 很投入了。但讨论的话题仅限于此，都是天马行空的纯理论，没有什么 特别的。他们曾邀请我加入‘科学边界’ ，但那样的话，参加这样的研讨 会就变成了一项义务，我因为精力有限就谢绝了。 ” “汪教授，我们希望您接受邀请，加入‘科学边界’学会，这也是我 们今天请您来的主要目的。 ”常将军说， “我们希望能通过您这个渠道， 得到一些这个组织的内部信息。 ” “您是说让我去卧底吗？ ”汪淼不安地问。 “哇哈哈，卧底！ ”大史大笑一声。 常伟思责备地看了大史一眼，对汪淼说： “只是提供一些情况，我 们也没有别的渠道。 ” 汪淼摇摇头： “对不起，首长。我不能干这事。 ” “汪教授， ‘科学边界’是一个由国际顶尖学者构成的组织，对它 的调查是一件极其复杂和敏感的事，我们真的是如履薄冰。没有知识界 的帮助，我们寸步难行，所以才提出了这个唐突的要求，希望您能理解。 不过我们也尊重您的意愿，如果不同意，我们也是能够理解的。 ” “我……工作很忙，也没有时间。 ”汪淼推托道。 常伟思点点头， “好的，汪教授，那我们就不再耽误您的时间了，谢 地球往事 三体 11 谢您能来参加这次会议。 ” 汪淼愣了几秒钟，才明白他该离开了。 常伟思礼貌地把汪淼送到会议室门口时，大史在后面大声说： “这 样挺好，我压根儿就不同意这个方案。已经有这么多书呆子寻了短见， 让他去不是‘肉包子打狗’吗？ ” 汪淼返身回去，走到大史身旁，努力克制着自己的愤怒， “你这么 说话实在不像一名合格的警官。 ” “我本来就不是。 ” “那些学者自杀的原因还没有搞清楚。你不该用这么轻蔑的口气 谈论他们，他们用自己的智慧为人类社会做出的贡献，是任何人都不可 替代的。 ” “你是说他们比我强？ ” 大史在椅子上仰头看着汪淼， “我总不至于 听人家忽悠几句就去寻短见。 ” “那你是说我会？ ” “总得对您的安全负责吧。 ” 大史看着汪淼， 又露出他招牌式的傻 笑。 “在那种情况下我比你要安全得多，你应该知道，一个人的鉴别能 力是和他的知识成正比的。 ” “那不见得，像您这样的……” “大史，你要再多说一句，也从这里出去好了！ ”常伟思严厉地喝斥 道。 “没关系，让他说， ”汪淼转向常将军， “我改变主意了，决定按您 的意思加入‘科学边界’ 。 ” “很好， ”大史连连点头， “进去后机灵点儿，有些事顺手就能做， 比如瞄一眼他们的电脑，记个邮件地址或网址什么的……” “够了！够了！你误会了，我不是去卧底，只是想证明你的无知和愚 蠢！” “如果您过一阵儿还活着，那自然也就证明了。不过恐怕……嘿 中国科幻基石丛书 12 嘿。”大史仰着头，傻笑变成了狞笑。 “我当然会一直活下去，但实在不想再见到你这号人了！ ” 常伟思一直把汪淼送下了楼梯，并安排车送他，在道别时说： “史 强就那种脾气，其实他是一名很有经验的刑警和反恐专家。二十多年 前，他曾是我连里的一名战士。 ” 走到车前，常伟思又说： “汪教授，你一定有很多问题要问。 ” “刚才您说的那些，与军方有什么关系？ ” “战争与军方当然有关系。 ” 汪淼迷惑地看看周围明媚春光中的一切， “可战争在哪儿？现在全 球一处热点都没有，应该是历史上最和平的年代了。 ” 常伟思露出了高深莫测的笑容： “你很快就会知道一切的， 所有人 都会知道。汪教授，你的人生中有重大的变故吗？这变故突然完全改变 了你的生活，对你来说，世界在一夜之间变得完全不同。 ” “没有。 ” “那你的生活是一种偶然，世界有这么多变幻莫测的因素，你的人 生却没什么变故。 ” 汪淼想了半天还是不明白。 “大部分人都是这样嘛。 ” “那大部分人的人生都是偶然。 ” “可……多少代人都是这么平淡地过来的。 ” “都是偶然。 ” 汪淼摇头笑了起来， “得承认今天我的理解力太差了， 您这岂不是 说……” “是的，整个人类历史也是偶然，从石器时代到今天，都没什么重大 变故，真幸运。但既然是幸运，总有结束的一天；现在我告诉你，结束了， 做好思想准备吧。 ” 汪淼还想问下去，但将军与他握手告别，阻止了他下面的问题。 上车后，司机开口问汪淼家的地址，汪淼告诉他后，随口问道： 地球往事 三体 13 “哦，接我来的不是你？我看车是一样的。 ” “不是我，我是去接丁博士的。 ” 汪淼心里一动，便向司机打听丁仪的住处，司机告诉了他。当天晚 上，他就去找丁仪。,"P AR T II T H R E E B O D Y4 T h e F r o n t i e r s o f S c i e n c e Forty-plus years later W ang Miao thought the four pe ople who came to find him made a rather odd com bination: two cops and two men in military uniforms. If the latter two were armed police, that wo uld be somewhat understandab le, but they were actually PLA of ficers. As s oon as W ang saw the cops, he felt annoyed. The younger one was all rightat least he was polite. But the other one, in plainclothes, immediately grated on him. He was thickset and had a face full of bulging muscles. W earing a dirty leather jacket, smelling of cigarettes, and speaking in a loud voice, he was exactly the sort of person W ang despi sed. “W ang Miao?” The way the cop addressed him by name only , so direct and impolite, made W ang unc omfortable. Add ing to the insult, the man lit a cigarette as he addre ssed hi m, without even lifting his head to show his f ace. Before W ang co uld answ er , the man nod ded at the younger cop, who showed W ang his badge. Having lit the cigarette, the older cop moved to enter W ang’ s apartment. “Please don’ t smoke in my home,” W ang said, blocking him. “Oh, sorry , Professor W ang.” T he young police of ficer smiled. “This is Captain Shi Qiang.” He gave Shi a pleading look. “Fine, we can talk in the hallway ,” Shi said. He took a deep drag. Almost half the cigarette had turned to ashes, and he didn’ t blow out muchsmoke. He inclined his head toward the younger police of fice r . “Y ou ask him, then.” “Professor W ang, we want to k now if you’ve had any recent contacts with members of the Frontiers of Science,” the young cop said. “The Frontiers of Science is full of famous scholars, a nd very influential. Why can’ t I have c ontact with a legal international academic group?” “Look a t the way you talk!” Shi said. “Did we say anything about it not being legal? Did we say anything about you not being allowed to contact them?” He finally blew out th e lungful of smoke that he had sucked in earlierright in W ang’ s face. “All righ t then. Please respect my privacy . I don’ t need to answ er your questions.” “Y our p rivacy ? Y ou’re a famous academic. Y ou have a responsibility toward t he publ ic welfare.” Shi threw away the butt and took out another cigarette from a flattened pack. “I have the right to not answer . P lease leave.” W ang turned around to go back inside. “W ait!” Shi shouted. He waved at the young cop next to him. “G ive him the address and phone number . Y ou can come by in the afternoon.” “What are you really after?” W ang said, his voice now ting ed with anger . The ar gument brought the neighbors, curious about what was happening, out into the hallway . “Captain Shi! Y ou said you” The young cop pulled Shi aside and continued speaking to him in hushed, ur gent tones. Apparently , W ang wasn’ t the only one annoyed by his rough manners. “Professor W ang, please don’ t misunderstand.” One of the army of ficers, a major , stepped forw ard. “There’ s an important meeting this afternoon, to which several scho lars and specialists are invited. The general sent us to invite you.” “I’m busy this afternoon.” “W e know . The general alr eady spoke with the head of the Nanotechnology Research Center . W e can’ t have this meeting without you. If you can’ t attend, we’ll have to reschedule.” Shi and the young cop said no thing. Both turned and went d own the stairs. The two army of ficers watched them leave and seemed to sigh withrelief. “What’ s wrong with that guy?” the major whispered to the other of ficer . “He’ s go t quite a record. Durin g a hostage crisis a few years ago, he acted recklessly , without concern for the lives of the hostages. In the end, a family o f three all died at the hands of the criminals. Rumor has it that he’ s also frie ndly with elements of or ganized crime, using one ga ng to fight another . Last year , he used tort ure to obtain confessions, and permanently disabled one of the suspects. That’ s why he was suspended from duty .…” W ang Miao suspected that he w as meant to overhear the conv ersation between the of ficers. Maybe they intended to show him that they were dif ferent from that rude cop; or maybe they wanted to make him curious about their mission. “How can a ma n like that be part of the Battle Command Cent er?” the major asked. “The general specifically reque sted him. I guess he must have some special skills. In any case, his duties are quite restricted. Other than public safety matters, he’ s not allowed to know much.” Battle Command Center? W ang looked at the two of ficers, baf fled. * * * The car they sent for W ang Miao took him to a lar ge compound in the suburbs. Since the door had only a number and no sign, W ang deduced that this building belonged to the military , rather than the police. W ang w as surpr ised by the chao s as he entered the lar ge meeting room. Around him were numerous computers in various states of disarray . They had run out of table space and p ut a few workstations directly o n the floor , where power cords and networking wires formed a tangled mes s. Instead of being installed in racks, a bunch of routers were left haphazard ly on top of the servers. Printer paper was scattered everywhere. A few projector screens stood in various corners of the room, sticking out at odd angles like gypsy tents. A cloud of smok e hovered over the room.… W ang Miao wasn’ t sure if this was the Battle Command Center , but he was sure of one thing: Whatever they were dealing with was too important for them to care about keeping up appearances.The mee ting tab le, formed by p ushing several smaller tables together , was pile d with documents and odds and ends. The attendees, their clothes wrinkled, looked exhausted. Those wearing ties had all pulled them loose. It seemed as if they had been up all night. A major general named Chang W eisi presided over the meeting, and half the attendees were military of ficers. After a few quick introductions, W ang found out that many of the others were police. The rest were academics like him, with a few prominent scientists specializ ing in basic research in the mix. He a lso found four foreigners in attendance. Their identities shocked him: a United States Air Force colonel and a British Army colonel, both NA T O liaisons, as well as two CIA of ficers, apparently acting as observers. On the faces o f everyone around the table, W ang could r ead one sentiment: W e’ve done all we can. Let’ s fucking get it over with, alr eady . W ang Miao saw Shi Qiang sitting at the table. In contrast to his rudeness yesterday , Shi greeted W ang as “Professor .” But the smirk on Shi’ s face annoyed W ang. He didn’ t want to sit next to Shi, but he had no choice, as that was the only empty seat. Th e already thick cloud of cigarette smoke in the room became thicker . As documents were distributed, Shi moved closer to W ang. “Professor W ang, I understand you’re researching some kind of … new material?” “Nanomaterial,” W ang answered. “I’ve he ard of it. That stuf f is re ally strong, right? Do you think it could be used to commit crimes?” As Shi’ s face was still half smir king, W ang couldn’ t tell if he was joking. “What do you mean?” “Heh. I heard that a strand of that stuf f could be used to lift up a truck. If criminals steal some and make it into a knife, can’ t they slice a car in half with one stroke?” “There’ s no need to even make it into a knife. That kind of material can be made into a line as thin as one-hundredth of a hair . If you string it across a roa d, a passing car would be sliced into two halves like cheese but what can’ t be used fo r criminal purposes? Even a dull knife for descaling a fish can!” Shi pulled a document halfway out of the envelope in front of him and shoved i t back in again, suddenly losing interest. “Y ou’re right. Even a fishcan be used to commit a crime. I handled a murder case once. Some bitch cut of f her husband’ s family jewels. Y ou know what she used? A frozen tilapia she got o ut of the freezer ! The spines along the back were like razors ” “I’m no t interes ted. Did you ask me to the meeting just to talk about this?” “Fish? Nanomat erials? No, no, nothing to do with those.” Shi put his mouth n ext to W ang’ s ear . “D on’ t be nice to them. They’re prejudiced against us. All they want is to get information out of us, but never tell us anything. Look at me. I’ve been here for a month, and I still don’ t know anything, just like you.” “Comrades,” General Chang said, “let’ s get started. Of all the combat zones ar ound the globe, this one has become the focal point. W e need to update the current situation for all the attending comrades.” The unusual term “combat zone ” gave W ang pause. He also noticed that the g eneral did not seem to want to explain in detail the backgro und of what they wer e dealin g with to new people like him. This supported Shi’ s point. Also, in General Chang’ s short opening remarks, he used the word “comrades” twi ce. W ang looked at the NA T O and CIA of f icers sitting across from him. The general had neglected to add “gentlemen.” “They’re also comrades. Anyway , that’ s how everyone addresses each other here,” Shi whispered to W ang, pointing at the four foreigners with his cigarette. While h e was baf fled by how Shi knew what he was thinkin g, W ang was impressed with his powers of observation. “Da Shi , put out your cigarette . There’ s enough smoke here,” General Chang s aid as he flipped through some documents. He called Shi Qiang by a nickname, “Big Shi.” Shi looked around but couldn’ t find an ashtray . In the end, he dropped the cigarette into a teacup. He ra ised his hand, and before Chang could even acknowledge hi m, he spoke loudly . “General, I have a request which I’ve made before: I want information parity .” General Chang lifted his head. “ There’ s never been a military o peration in which there was information parity . I have to apologize to all the scholars, but we cannot give you any more background.”“W e are not t he same as the eggheads,” Shi said. “The police have been part of the Battl e Command Center from the start. But even now , we still don’ t kn ow wha t this is all about. Y ou continue to push the police out. Y ou learn from us w hat you need a bout our techniques, and then you send us away one by one.” Several other police of ficers in attendance whispered to Shi to shut up. It surprised W ang that Shi dared to speak in this manner to a man of Chang’ s rank. But Chang’ s response surprised him even more. “Da Shi , it seems that you still have the same problem you had back when yo u were in the army . Y ou think you can speak for the police? Because of your poor record, y ou had already been suspended for several months, and you were about to be expelled from the force. I asked for you because I value your experienc e in city policing. Y ou should treasure this opportunity .” Shi con tinued to speak roughly . “So I’m working in the hope of redeeming myself by good service? I thought you told me that all my techniques were dishonest and crooked.” “But us eful.” C hang nodded at Shi. “All we care about is if they’re useful. In a time of war , we can’ t af ford to be too scrupulous.” “W e can ’ t be too fastidious,” a CIA of ficer said, in perfect Modern Standard Mandarin. “W e can no longer rely on conventional thinking.” The British colonel apparently also understood Chinese. He nodded. “T o be, or not to be…” he added in English. “It’ s a matter of life and death.” “What is he saying?” Shi asked W ang. “Nothing,” W ang replied mechanically . The people before him seemed to be speaking o ut of a dream. T ime of war? Wher e is this war? He twisted to lo ok o ut one of the floor -length windows. Through the window he could see Beijing in the distance: Under the spring sun, cars filled the streets like a de nse river; on a lawn someone was walking a dog; a few children were playing.… Which is mor e r eal? The world inside or outside these walls? General Chang said, “Recently , the enemy has intensified the pattern of attacks. The tar gets remain elite scientists. Please begin by taki ng a look at the list of names in the document.” W ang took out the first page of the document, printed in lar ge f ont. The list seemed to have been generated in a hurry , containing both Chinese andEnglish names. “Professor W ang, as you look th rough these names, does anything strike you?” General Chang asked. “I kn ow three of the names. All of them are famous scholars wo rking at the fore front of physics research.” W ang was a little distracte d. His eyes locked onto the last name on the list. In his mind, the two characters took on a dif ferent tint than the names above it. How can her name appear her e ? What happened to her? “Y ou kn ow her? ” Shi pointed t o the name with a thick finger , stained yellow f rom sm oking. W ang did not reply . “Ha. Don’ t know her . But want to know her?” Now W a ng Miao understood why it made sense for General Chang to have asked to have this man who was once a soldier under his command. Shi, who appeared so vulgar and careless, had eyes as sharp as knives. Maybe he wasn’ t a good cop, but he was certainly a fearsome one. * * * A year earlier , W ang Miao had been in char ge of the nanoscale components for the “Sinotron II” high-ener gy particle accelerator project. One afternoon, during a brief break at the Liangxiang construction site, W ang was struck by th e scene before h im. As a landscape photography enthusiast, W ang often saw the sights around him as artistic compositions. The ma in component of the composition was the solenoid of the superconducting magnet they w ere still installing. About three stories high and only half completed, the magnet loomed like a monster made of giant blocks of metal and a confusing mess of cryogenic coolant pipes. Like a junk heap from the Industrial Revolution, the structure exuded inhuman technological grimness and steel-bound barbarity . In front of this metal monster stood the slim figure of a young woman. The com position’ s lighting was fantastic as well: The metal monster was buried in the shadow of a temporary construction shel ter , further emphasizing its stern, rough q uality . But a single ray of light from the westering sun coming through th e central hole in the shelter fell right on the woman. The soft glow lit up her supple hair and highlighted her white neckabove the collar of her overalls, as though a single flower was blooming in a metal ruin after a violent thunderstorm.… “What are you looking at? Get back to work!” W ang was shocked out of his reverie, but then realized that the director of the Nanotech nology Research Center wasn’ t talking to him, but to a young engineer who had also b een staring at the woman. Having returned from art to reality , W ang saw that the young woman wasn’ t an ordinary workerthe chief engineer stood next to her , explaining something respectfully . “Who is she?” W ang asked the director . “Y ou sh ould kno w her ,” the dir ector said, waving his hand aro und in a lar ge circle. “The first experiment on this twenty-billion-yuan accelerator will pro bably be to test her superstring model. Now , seniority matters in theoretical phys ics, and normally , she wouldn’ t have been senior enough to get t he first sho t. But those old er academics didn’ t dare to show up first, afraid that they might fail and lose face, so that’ s why she got the chance.” “What? Y ang Dong is … a woman?” “Indeed,” the director said. “W e only found out when we finally met her two days ago.” The you ng engineer asked, “Does she have some psychological issue? Why else wouldn’ t she agree to be interviewed by the media? Maybe she’ s like Qian Zhongshu,1 1 who died without ever appearing on TV .” “But at least w e knew Qian’ s gender . I bet Y ang had some unusual experiences as a child. Maybe it made her somewhat autistic.” W ang’ s words w ere tinged with a hint of self-mockery . He wasn’ t even famous enough for the media to be interested in him, let alone to turn down interview requests. Y ang wa lked ov er with the chief engineer . As they passed, she smiled at W ang and the others, nodding lightly without saying anything. W ang remembered her limpid eyes. That nig ht, W ang sat in his study and admired the few la ndscape photographs, his works he was the most proud of, hanging on t he wall. His eyes fell on a fro ntier scene: a d esolate valley terminating in a s nowcapped mountain. On the nearer end of the valley , half of a dead tree, er oded by the vicissitudes of many years, took up one-third of the pict ure. In hisimagination, W ang placed the figure that lingered in his mind at the far end of the valley . Surprisingly , it made the entire scene come alive, as though the world in the photograph recognized that tiny figure and responded to it, as though the whole scene existed for her . He then imagined her figure in each of his other photographs, sometimes pasti ng her two eye s into the empty sky over the landscapes. Those images also came alive, achieving a beauty that W ang had never imagined. W ang had always thought that his photographs lacked some kind of soul. Now he understood that they were missing her . * * * “All the physicists on this list have committed suicide in the last two months,” General Chang said. W ang was thunderstruck. Gradually , his black-and-white lan dscapes faded in to blank ness in his mind . The photographs no longer ha d her figure in the foreground, and her eyes were wiped from the skies. Those worlds were all dead. “When … did this happen?” W ang asked mechanically . “The last two months,” Chang repeated. “Y ou mean the last name, don’ t you?” Shi responded with sati sfaction. “She was the last to commit suicidetwo nights ago, overdosed on sleeping pills. She died very peacefully . No pain.” For a moment, W ang was grateful to Shi. “Why?” W ang asked. The dead scenes in those landscape phot ographs continued to flicker through his mind. General Chang replied, “The only thing we can be sure of is this: The same reason drove all of them to suicide. But it’ s hard to articulate. Maybe it’ s imp ossible for us nonspecialists to even understand the reason. The document contai ns excerpts from their suicide notes. Everyone can examine them after the meeting.” W ang flipped through the notes: All of them seemed to be long essays. “Dr . Ding, would you please show Y ang Dong’ s note to Professor W ang? Hers is the shortest and possibly the most representative.”The man in question, Ding Y i, had been silent until now . After another pause, h e finally took out a white envelope and handed it across the table to W ang. Shi whispered, “He was Y ang’ s boyfriend.” W ang recalled that he had seen Ding at the particle accelerator construction site in Liangxiang. He was a the oretician who had became famous for his discovery of the macroatom while studying ball lightning.12 W ang took fr om the envelope a thin, irregularly shap ed sheet exuding a faint fragrancenot paper , but birch bark. A single line of graceful characters was written on it: All the evidence points to a single conclusion: Physics has never existed, and will never exist. I know what I’m doing is irr esponsible. But I have no choice. There wasn’ t even a signature. She was gone. “Physics … does not exist?” W ang had no idea what to think. General Chang closed the folde r . “The file also contains some specific information related to the experimental results obtained after the completion of the world’ s th ree newest particle accelerators. It’ s very techn ical, and we won’ t be discussing it here. The first focus of our investigation is the Frontiers of Science. UNESCO designated 2005 the W orld Y ear of Physics, and that or ganization gradually developed out of the numerous academic conferences and exchanges that occurred among world physicists that year . Dr . Ding, since you’re a theo retical physicist, can you give us more background on it?” Ding nodded. “I have no direct connection with the Frontiers of Science, but it is famous in academia. It s core goal is a response to the following: Since the second half of the twentieth century , physics has gradually lost the concision and simplicity of its classical theories. Modern theoretical models have bec ome m ore and more co mplex, vague, and uncertain. Experimental verification has become more dif ficult as well. This is a si gn that the forefront of physics research seems to be hitting a wall. “Members of the Frontiers of Science want to attempt a new way of thinking. T o put it simply , they want to use the methods of science to discover the limits of science, to try to find out if there is a limit to howdeeply and precisely science can know naturea boundary beyond which science cannot go. The develop ment of modern physics seems to suggest that such a line has been touched.” “V ery good,” General Chang said. “According to our investigation, most of the scholars who committed suicide had some connection with the Frontiers of Science, and some were even members. But we’ve found no evidence of the use of illegal ps ychotropic drugs or techniques akin to the psychological manipulation of religious cults. In other words, even if the Frontiers of Science influenced them, it was only through legal academic exchanges. Professor W ang, sinc e they recently contacted you, we’d like to ask you for some information.” Shi added gruf fly , “Including the names of your contacts, the times and locations of meetings, the co ntent of your conversations, and if you exchanged letters or e-mails” “Shut up, Da Shi!” General Chang said. Another police of ficer leaned ov er and whispered to Shi, “Do you think we’ll fo r get you have a mouth if you don’ t use it all the time?” Shi picked up his teacup, saw the drowned cigarette butt inside, and put it back down. Shi’ s questions irritated W ang again, not unlike the feeling a man has upon fin ding out that he has swallowed a fly with his meal. The gratitude he had felt earlier was gone without a trace. But he restrained himself and answered, “My contact with t he Frontiers of Science began with Shen Y ufei. She’ s a J apanese physicist of Chinese descent who currently works for a Jap anese c ompany here in Beijing. She once worked at a Mitsubishi lab, res earching nanotech. W e met at a technical conference at the beginning of this year . Through her , I met a few other physicist friends, all members of the Frontiers of Science, some Chinese, some fore ign. When I talked with them, all the topics were … how do I put this? V ery radical. They all involv ed the question that Dr . Ding just described: What is the limit of science? “Initially , I didn’ t have much interest in these topics. I thought of them as o nly an idle pastime. My work is in applied research, and I don’ t know much about these theoretical matters. Mainly , I was interested in listening to their dis cussions and ar guments . All of them were deep thinkers with novel points of view , and I felt that I was opening my mind t hrough the exchanges. Grad ually , I grew m ore interested. But all our talk was limitedto pure theory a nd nothing else. They once invited me to join t he Frontiers of S cience. But if I had done so, attending the discussions would have turned into a duty . Since my time and ener gy were limited, I declined.” “Professor W an g,” General Chang said, “we’d like you to ac cept the invitation and join the Frontier s of Science. This is the main reason we asked you here today . Through you, we’d like to learn more about the internal workings of the or ganization.” “Y ou want me to be a mole?” W ang was uneasy . “A mole!” Shi laughed. Chang g ave Shi a reprimanding look. He turned back to W ang. “W e just want you to give us some information. W e have no other way in.” W ang shook his head. “I’m sorry , General. I cannot do this.” “Professor W ang, the Frontie rs of Science is made up of elite international scholars. Investigating it is an extremely complex and sensitive matter . For us, it’ s like walking across thin ice. W itho ut someone from academia helping us, we cannot make any progress. This is why we’re making this request. But we’ll respect your wishes. If you won’ t agree, we understand.” “I am … very busy at work. I just don’ t have the time.” General Chang nodded. “All rig ht, Professor W ang, we won’ t w aste any more of your time. Thank you for coming to this meeting.” W ang waited a few more seconds before realizing that he h ad been dismissed. General Chang politely accompa nied W ang to the door . They could hear Shi’ s loud voice behind them. “It’ s better this way . I disagree with the plan anyway . So many bookworms have already killed themselves. If we send him, he’d be a meat dumpling thrown to the dogs.” W ang turned around and walked back to Shi. Forcing his anger down, W ang said, “The way you speak is not appropriate for a g ood police of ficer .” “Who said I’m a good cop?” “W e don’ t know why these researchers killed themselves, but you shouldn’ t speak of them so contemptuously . Their minds have made irreplaceable contributions to humanity .” “Y ou’re saying they’re better than me?” Still seated, Shi lifted his eyes to meet W ang’ s. “At least I wouldn’ t kill myself just because someone toldme some bullshit.” “Y ou think I would?” “I have to be concerned about your safety .” That trademark smirk again. “I th ink I would be much safer than you in such situations. Y ou must know th at a person’ s ability to discern the truth is directly pro portional to his knowledge.” “I’m not sure about that. T ake someone like you” “Be quiet, Da Shi!” General Chang said. “One more sentence and you’re out of here!” “It’ s okay ,” W ang said. “Let him speak.” He turned to General Chang. “I’ve changed my mind. I will join the Frontiers of Science as you wish.” “Good!” Shi nodded vigorously . “Stay alert after you join. Gather intelligence whenever it’ s convenient. For example, glance at their computer screens, memorize e-mail or W eb addresses” “That’ s enough! Y ou misunderstand me. I don’ t want to be a spy . I just want to prove you’re an idiot!” “If y ou remain a live after you’ve joined them for a while, that would be the best proof. But I’m afraid fo r you…” Shi lifted his face, and the smirk turned into a wolfish grin. “Of course I’ll stay alive! But I never want to see you again.” * * * They kept W ang out of the way while the others left so he woul dn’ t have to deal wit h Shi Qiang again. Then General Chang walked W ang all the way down the stairs and called for a car to take him back. He said to W a ng, “Don’ t worry about Shi Qiang. That’ s just his personality . He’ s actually a very experienced beat of ficer and antiterrorism expert. T wenty years ago, he was a soldier in my company .” As they approached the car , Chang added, “Professor W ang, you must have many questions.” “What d id ever ything you talked about in there have to do with the military?” “W ar has everything to do with the army .” W ang lo oked ar ound in the spri ng sun, baf fled. “But where is this war? This is probably the most peaceful period in history .”Chang gave him an inscrutabl e smile. “Y ou will know mo re soon. Everyone will know . Professor W ang, have you ever had anything happen to yo u that chan ged your life completely? Some event where af terward the world became a totally dif ferent place for you?” “No.” “Then your life has been fortun ate. The world is full of unpre dictable factors, yet you have never faced a crisis.” W ang turned over the words in his mind, still not understanding. “I think that’ s true of most lives.” “Then most people have lived fortunately .” “But … many generations have lived in this plain manner .” “All fortunate.” W ang la ughed, s haking his head. “I have to confess that I’m no t feeling very sharp today . Are you suggesting that” “Y es, th e entire history of hum ankind has been fortunate. From the Stone A ge till now , no real crisi s has occurred. W e’ve been very lucky . But if it’ s all luck, then it has to end one day . Let me tell you: It’ s ended. Prepare for the worst.” W ang w anted to ask more, but Chang shook his head and said go od-bye, preventing any more questions. After W ang got into the car , the driver asked for his address. W ang gave it and asked, “Oh, were you the one who took me here? I thought it was the same type of car .” “No, it wasn’ t me. I took Dr . Ding here.” W ang ha d a new idea. He asked the driver to take him to Ding’ s address instead."
中国科幻基石丛书 14 2．台 球 推开丁仪那套崭新的三居室的房门，汪淼闻到了一股酒味，看到丁 仪躺在沙发上，电视开着，他的双眼却望着天花板。汪淼四下打量了一 下，看到房间还没怎么装修，也没什么家具和陈设，宽大的客厅显得很 空，最显眼的是客厅一角摆放的一张台球桌。 对汪淼的不请自来，丁仪倒没表示反感，他显然也想找人说话。 “这套房子是三个月前买的， ”丁仪说， “我买房子干什么？难道她 真的会走进家庭？ ”他带着醉意笑着摇摇头。 “你们……”汪淼想知道杨冬生活中的一切，但又不知该如何问。 “她像一颗星星，总是那么遥远，照到我身上的光也总是冷的。 ”丁 仪走到窗前看着夜空，像在寻找那颗已逝去的星辰。 汪淼也沉默下来。很奇怪，他现在就是想听一听她的声音，一年前 那个夕阳西下的时刻，她同他对视的那一瞬间没有说话，他从来没有听 到过她的声音。 丁仪一挥手， 像要赶走什么， 将自己从这哀婉的思绪中解脱出来。 “汪教授，你是对的，别跟军方和警方纠缠到一块儿，那是一群自以为 是的白痴。那些物理学家的自杀与‘科学边界’没有关系，我对他们解 释过，可解释不清。 ” “他们好像也做过一些调查。 ” “是，而且这种调查还是全球范围的，那他们也应该知道，其中的 两人与‘科学边界’没有任何来往，包括杨冬。 ”丁仪说出这个名 字时显得很吃力。 地球往事 三体 15 “丁仪，你知道，我现在也卷进这件事里了。所以，关于使杨冬做出 这种选择的原因，我很想知道，我想你一定知道一些。 ”汪淼笨拙地说 道，试图掩盖他真正的心迹。 “如果知道了，你只会卷得更深。现在你只是人和事卷进来了，知 道后连精神也会卷进来，那麻烦就大了。 ” “我是搞应用研究的，没有你们理论派那么敏感。 ” “那好吧，打过台球吗？ ”丁仪走到了台球桌前。 “上学时随便玩过几下。 ” “我和她很喜欢打，因为这让我们想到了加速器中的粒子碰撞。 ” 丁仪说着拿起黑白两个球，将黑球放到洞旁，将白球放到距黑球仅十厘 米左右的位置，问汪淼， “能把黑球打进去吗？ ” “这么近谁都能。 ” “试试。 ” 汪淼拿球杆，轻击白球，将黑球撞入洞内。 “很好，来，我们把球桌换个位置。 ”丁仪招呼一脸迷惑的汪淼，两 人抬起沉重的球桌，将它搬到客厅靠窗的一角。放稳后，丁仪从球袋内 掏出刚才打进去的黑球，将它放到洞边，又拾起那个白球，再次放到距 黑球十厘米左右的地方， “这次还能打进去吗？ ” “当然。 ” “打吧。 ” 汪淼再次轻而易举地将黑球打入洞内。 “搬。 ”丁仪挥手示意，两人再次抬起球桌，搬到客厅的第三个角， 丁仪又将黑白两个球摆放到同样的位置， “打吧。 ” “我说，我们……” “打吧。 ” 汪淼无奈地笑笑，第三次将黑球击入洞内。 他们又搬了两次台球桌，一次搬到了客厅靠门的一角，最后一次搬 回了原位。丁仪又两次将黑白球摆到洞前的位置，汪淼又两次将黑球击 中国科幻基石丛书 16 入洞内。这时两人都有些出汗了。 “好了，实验结束，让我们来分析一下结果。 ”丁仪点上一枝烟说， “我们总共进行了五次试验，其中四次在不同的空间位置和不同的时 间，两次在同一空间位置但时间不同。您不对结果震惊吗？”他夸张地 张开双臂， “五次，撞击试验的结果居然都一样！ ” “你到底想表达什么？ ”汪淼喘着气问。 “你现在对这令人难以置信的结果做出解释，用物理学语言。 ” “这……在五次试验中，两个球的质量是没有变化的；所处位置， 当然是以球桌面为参照系来说，也没有变化；白球撞击黑球的速度向量 也基本没有变化，因而两球之间的动量交换也没有变化，所以五次试验 中黑球当然都被击入洞中。 ” 丁仪拿起撂在地板上的一瓶白兰地，把两个脏兮兮的杯子分别倒 满，递给汪淼一杯，后者谢绝了。 “应该庆祝一下，我们发现了一个伟大 的定律：物理规律在时间和空间上是均匀的。人类历史上的所有物理学 理论，从阿基米德原理到弦论，以至人类迄今为止的一切科学发现和思 想成果，都是这个伟大定律的副产品，与我们相比，爱因斯坦和霍金才 真是搞应用的俗人。 ” “我还是不明白你想表达什么。 ” “想象另一种结果：第一次，白球将黑球撞入洞内；第二次，黑球走 偏了；第三次，黑球飞上了天花板；第四次，黑球像一只受惊的麻雀在房 间里乱飞，最后钻进了您的衣袋；第五次，黑球以接近光速的速度飞出， 把台球桌沿撞出一个缺口，击穿了墙壁，然后飞出地球，飞出太阳系，就 像阿西莫夫描写的那样 ① 。这时您怎么想？ ” 丁仪盯着汪淼，后者沉默许久才问： “这事真的发生了， 是吗？ ” 丁仪将手中的两杯酒都仰头灌下去，两眼直勾勾地看着台球桌，仿 佛那是个魔鬼， “是的，发生了。近年来，基础理论研究的实验验证条件 渐渐成熟，有三个昂贵的‘台球桌’被造了出来，一个在北美，一个在欧 ①这里指阿西莫夫的科幻小说《台球》 。 地球往事 三体 17 洲，还有一个你当然知道，在中国良湘，你们纳米中心从那里赚了不少 钱。 “这些高能加速器将实验中粒子对撞的能量提高了一个数量级， 这是人类以前从未达到过的。在新的对撞能级下，同样的粒子，同样的 撞击能量，一切试验条件都相同，结果却不一样。不但在不同的加速度 上不一样，在同一加速器不同时间的试验中也不一样，物理学家们慌 了，把这种相同条件的超高能撞击试验一次次地重复，但每次的结果都 不同，也没有规律。 ” “这意味着什么呢？”汪淼问，看到丁仪盯着自己不做声，他又补充 道， “哦，我搞纳米，也接触物质微观结构，但比起你们来要浅好几个层 次，请指教一下。 ” “这意味着物理规律在时间和空间上不均匀。 ” “这又意味着什么呢？ ” “往下您应该能推论出来吧，那个将军都想出来了，他真是个聪明 人。 ” 汪淼看着窗外沉思着，外面城市的灯海一片灿烂，夜空中的星星被 淹没得看不见了。 “这就意味着宇宙普适的物理规律不存在，那物理学……也不存 在了。 ”汪淼从窗外收回目光说。 “‘我知道自己这样做是不负责任的，但别无选择。 ’”丁仪紧接着 说， “这是她遗书的后半部分，您无意中刚说出了前半部分，现在多少 能够理解她吧。 ” 汪淼从台球桌上拿起刚才他打过五次的那个白球，抚摸了一会儿 轻轻放下， “这对一个前沿理论的探索者确实是个灾难。 ” “在理论物理这个领域要想有所建树，需要一种宗教般的执着，这 很容易把人引向深渊。 ” 告辞时，丁仪给了汪淼一个地址。 “你如果有空，拜托去看看杨冬 的母亲。杨冬一直和她住在一起，女儿是她生活的全部，现在就一个人 中国科幻基石丛书 18 了，很可怜。 ” 汪淼说： “丁仪，你知道得显然比我多，就不能再透露一点吗？你真 的相信物理规律在时空上不均匀？ ” “我什么都不知道……” 丁仪与汪淼对视了好长时间，最后说： “这是个问题。 ” 汪淼知道，他不过是接下了那位英军上校的话：生存还是死亡，这 是个问题。,"5 A G a m e o f P o o l As s oon as he opened the door to Ding Y i’ s brand-new three-bedroom apartment, W ang smelled alcohol. Ding was lying on the sofa w ith the TV on, stari ng at the ceiling. The a partment was unfinished, with only a few pieces o f furniture and little decoration, and the huge living room seemed very empty . The most eye-catching object was the pool table in the corner . Ding didn’ t seem annoyed by W ang’ s unannounced visit. He was clearly in the mood to talk to someone. “I bo ught the ap artment about three months ago,” Ding said. “Why did I buy it? Did I really think she w as going to become interested in starting a family?” His laugh sounded drunk. “Y ou tw o…” W ang wanted to k now the details of Y ang Dong’ s life, but didn’ t know how to ask the questions. “She was like a star , always so distant. Even the light she shone on me was alw ays cold.” Ding walked to one of the windows and look ed up at the night sky . W ang said nothing. All he wanted now was to hear her voice. But a year ago, as the sun sank in the west, when she and he had locked eyes for a moment, they had not spoken to each other . He had never heard her voice. Ding waved his hand as though trying to flick something away . “Professor W ang, you were right. Don’ t get involved with the police or the military . They’re all idiots. The deaths of those physicists had nothing to dowith the Frontiers of Science. I ’ve explained it to them many times, but I can’ t get them to understand.” “They seem to have conducted some independent investigation.” “Y es, and the i nvestigation’ s scope was global. They should already know th at two of the dead never had any contact with the Frontiers of Science, including … Y ang Dong.” Ding seemed to have troubl e saying her name. “Ding Y i, you k now that I am already involved. So … as far as why Y ang m ade the choice that … she did, I’d like to know . I thin k you must know some of it.” W ang thought he must sound very foolish as he tried hard to disguise his real intent. “If y ou know m ore, you’ll only get pulled in deeper . Right now you’re just superficially involved, but with more knowledge your spirit will be drawn in as well, and then it will mean real trouble.” “I work in applied research. I’m not as sensitive as you theoreticians.” “All right, then. Do you play pool?” Ding walked to the pool table. “I used to play a little in college.” “She and I loved to play . It re minded us of particles colliding in the accelerator .” Ding picked up two balls: one black and one white. He set the black ball next to one of the pockets, and placed the white ba ll about ten centimeters from the black ball. “Can you pocket the black ball?” “This close? Anyone can do it.” “T ry .” W ang picked up the cue, struck the white ball lightly , and drove the black ball into the pocket. “Good. Come, now let’ s move the table to a dif ferent location.” Ding directed the confused W ang to pick up the heavy table. T ogether they moved i t to another corner of th e living room, next to a window . Then Ding scooped out the black ball, set it next to the pocket, and again pi cked up the white ball and set it down about ten centimeters away . “Think you can do it again?” “Of course.” “Go for it.” Again, W ang easily made the shot. Ding wa ved his hands. “Let’ s m ove it again.” They lifted the table and set it down in a third corner of the living room. Ding set up the two balls asbefore. “Go.” “Listen, we” “Go!” W ang shrugged helplessly . He m anaged to pocket the black bal l a third time. They moved the table two more times: once next to the doo r of the living room, and finally back to the original location. Ding set up the two balls tw ice more, and W ang twice more made his shot. By now both were slightly winded. “Good, that’ s the conclusion of the experiment. Let’ s analyze the results.” Ding lit a cigarette before continuing, “W e ran the same experiment five times. Four of th e experiments dif fered in both location and time. T w o of the experiments were at the same location but dif f erent times. Aren’ t you shocked by the res ults?” He opened his arms ex aggeratedly . “Five times! Every colliding experiment yielded the exact same result!” “What are you trying to say?” W ang asked, gasping. “Can yo u explain this incredible result? Please use the language of physics.” “All right … During these five experiments, the mass of the two balls never changed. In terms of their locations, as long as we’re using the frame of reference of the tabletop, the re was also no change. The velocity of the white ball striking the black ball also remained basically the same throughout. Thus, the transfer of momentum between the two balls didn’ t change. Therefore, in all five experiments, the result was the black ball being driven into the pocket.” Ding picked up a bottle of brandy and two dirty glasses from t he floor . He filled both and handed one to W ang. W ang declined. “Come on, let’ s celebrate. W e’v e discovered a great principle o f nature: The laws of physics are invariant across space and time. All the physical laws of human h istory , from Archimedes’ principle to string the ory , and all the scientific discoveries and in tellectual fruits of our species are the by- products of this great law . Com pared to us two theoreticians, Einstein and Hawking are mere applied engineers.” “I still don’ t understand what you’re getting at.” “Imagine another set of results. The first time, the white ball drove the black ball into the pocket. The second time, the black ball bounced away .The thir d time, the black ball flew onto the ceiling. The fourth time, the black ball shot around the room like a frightened sparrow , finally taking refuge i n your jacket pocket. T he fifth time, the black ball flew away at nearly the speed of light, breaking the edge of the pool tab le, shooting through the wall, and leaving the Earth and the Solar System, just like Asimov once described.13 What would you think then?” Ding watched W ang. After a long silence, W ang finally said, “This actually happened. Am I right?” Ding drained both glasses in his hands. He stared at the pool table as though l ooking at a demon. “Y es. It happened. In the last few years, we finally obtained the necessary equipment for experimentally testing fundamental theories. Three expensive ‘pool tables’ have been constructed: one in North America, another in Europe, and the third you are familiar with, in Liangxiang. Y our Nanotechnology Research Center earned a lot of money from it. “These high-ener gy particle accelerators raised the amount of ener gy available for colliding particles by an order of magnitude, to a level never before a chieved by the human r ace. Y et, with the new equipme nt, the same particles, the same ener gy levels, and the same experimental parameters would yield dif ferent results. N ot only would the results vary if dif ferent accelerators were used, but even with the same accelerator , experiments performed at dif ferent times would give dif ferent results. Physicists panicked. They repeated the ult ra-high-ener gy collision experiments again and agai n using the same conditions, but every time the result w as dif ferent, and there seemed to be no pattern.” “What d oes this mean?” W ang a sked. When he saw Ding starin g at him without speakin g, he added, “O h, I’m in nanotech, and I also work with microscale struc tures. But that’ s orders of magnitude lar ger than the scale at which you do your work. Please educate me.” “It mean s that the laws of phy sics are not invariant across t ime and space.” “What does that mean?” “I think you can deduce the rest. Even General Chang figured it out. He’ s really a smart man.”W ang looked outside the window thoughtfully . The lights of the city were so bright that the stars of the night sky were drowned out. “It means that laws of physics that could be applied anywhere in the universe do not exist, which means that physics … also does not exist.” W ang turned back from the window . “‘I k now what I ’m doing is irre sponsible. But I have no choice ,’” Ding said. “That was the second half of her note. Y ou just stumbled on the first half. Now can you understand her? At least a little?” W ang picked up the white ball. He caressed it for a bit and put it back down. “For someone exploring t he forefront of theory , that would indeed be a catastrophe.” “T o acc omplish something in theoretical physics requires one to have almost religious faith. It’ s easy to be led to the abyss.” As t hey said the ir farewells, Ding gave W ang an address. “If y ou have the t ime, please visit Y ang Dong’ s mother . She and her mother a lways lived together , and she was the entiret y of her mother ’ s life. Now the old woman is all alone.” “Ding, you clearly know a lot more than I do. Can you tell me more? Y ou really believe that the laws of physics are not invariant across time and space?” “I do n’ t know a nything.” Ding stared into W ang’ s eyes for a lo ng time. Finally , he said, “But that is the question.” W ang k new that he was only finishing what the British colonel had begun to say: T o be, or not to be: that is the question."
地球往事 三体 19 3．射手和农场主 第二天是周末，汪淼反而起得很早，带上相机骑着自行车出去了。 作为一名摄影爱好者，他最向往的题材是人迹罕至的荒野，但人到中 年，已经没有精力进行这种奢侈的享受了，大多数时间只能在城市里拍 风景了。他有意无意地选取城市中那些散发着蛮荒气息的角落，如公园 中干涸的湖底、建筑工地上翻出的新土、钻出水泥缝隙的野草等。为了 消除背景上城市的俗艳色彩，他只使用黑白胶片，没想到竟自成一派， 渐渐小有名气，作品入选了两次大影展，还加入了摄影家协会。每次出 去拍摄，他就这样骑着自行车在城市里随意乱转，捕捉着灵感和他需要 的构图，有时一转就是一整天。 今天，汪淼的感觉有些异样。他的摄影以古典风格的沉稳凝重见 长，但今天，他很难再找到创造这种构图所需要的稳定感，在他的感觉 中，这座正在晨曦中苏醒的城市似乎建立在流沙上，它的稳定是虚幻 的。在刚过去的那一夜，那两颗台球一直占据着他长长的梦境，它在黑 色的空间中无规则地乱飞，在黑色的背景上黑球看不见，它只有在偶尔 遮挡白球时才显示一下自己的存在。 难道物质的本原真的是无规律吗？难道世界的稳定和秩序，只是宇 宙某个角落短暂的动态平衡？只是混乱的湍流中一个短命的旋涡？ 不知不觉中，他已骑到了新落成的 CCTV 大厦脚下。他停下车，坐 到路边，仰望这 A字形的巍峨建筑，试图找回稳定的感觉，顺着大厦在 朝阳中闪烁的尖顶的指向，他向深不见底的蓝色苍穹望去，脑海中突然 浮现出两个词：射手、农场主。 中国科幻基石丛书 20 在“科学边界”的学者们进行讨论时，常用到一个缩写词： SF，它不 是指科幻，而是上面那两个词的缩写。这源自两个假说，都涉及到宇宙 规律的本质。 “射手”假说：有一名神枪手，在一个靶子上每隔十厘米打一个洞。 设想这个靶子的平面上生活着一种二维智能生物，它们中的科学家在 对自己的宇宙进行观察后，发现了一个伟大的定律： “宇宙每隔十厘 米，必然会有一个洞。 ”它们把这个神枪手一时兴起的随意行为，看成 了自己宇宙中的铁律。 “农场主假说”则有一层令人不安的恐怖色彩：一个农场里有一群 火鸡，农场主每天中午十一点来给它们喂食。火鸡中的一名科学家观察 这个现象，一直观察了近一年都没有例外，于是它也发现了自己宇宙中 的伟大定律： “每天上午十一点，就有食物降临。 ”它在感恩节早晨向火 鸡们公布了这个定律，但这天上午十一点食物没有降临，农场主进来把 它们都捉去杀了。 汪淼感到脚下的路面像流沙般滑动， A字形大厦仿佛摇晃起来， 他赶紧收回目光。 仅仅是为了摆脱不安，汪淼强迫自己拍完了一个胶卷，午饭前回到 了家。妻子带着孩子出去玩，中午不回来了。往常，汪淼一定会迫不及待 地把胶卷冲出来，但今天他一点兴致都没有。简单地吃过午饭后，他倒 头便睡，由于昨天夜里没睡好，一觉睡醒后都快五点了。他这时才想起 上午拍的胶卷，便钻到那间由壁橱改成的狭窄暗室里去冲洗。 胶片很快冲出来了，他开始查看哪张值得放大洗成照片，在第一张 就发现了一件离奇的事。这张拍的是一个大商场外的一小片草地，他看 到底片正中有一行白色的东西，细看是一排数字： 1200:00:00 。 第二张底片上也有数字： 1199:49:33 。 整卷胶片，每张底片上都有小小的一排数字！ 第三张 :1199:40:18 ； 第四张 :1199:32:07 ； 第五张 :1199:28:51 ； 第六张： 地球往事 三体 21 1199:15:44 ；第七张： 1199:07:38 ；第八张 :1198:53:09 ……第三十四张： 1194:50:49 ；第三十六张，也是最后一张 :1194:16:37 。 汪淼立刻想到是胶卷的问题。 他使用的 1988 年产的莱卡 M2型相 机，全机械手动，没有任何自动化功能，更不可能往胶片上叠印日期 一类的数字。仅凭其品质卓绝的镜头和机械机构，即使在数码时代，也 是专业相机中的贵族。 重新查看每张底片，汪淼很快发现了这些数字的第一个诡异之处： 它们自动适应背景。如果背景是黑色，数字则为白色，白色背景上的数 字就是黑色，似乎是为了形成最大的反差便于观察者看清。当汪淼再看 第十六张底片时，心跳加快了，感到暗室中有一股寒气沿着脊背升上 来： 这张拍的是以一面老墙为背景的一棵枯树，老墙斑驳一片，在照片 上黑白相间。在这样的背景上，那行数字以正常的位置无论是黑是白都 不可能显示清楚，但它竟竖了起来，且弯曲自身，沿着枯树深色的树身 呈白色显示，看上去仿佛是附着在枯树上的一条细蛇！ 汪淼开始研究那些数字的数学关系，起初他以为是某种编号，但每 组数字的间隔并不相同，他很快明白这是以小时、分、秒为单位的计时。 他拿出了拍摄笔记，上面详细记录了每张照片的拍摄时间，精确到分。 他发现两张照片上计时的差值与它们实际拍摄的时间间隔是一致的。 很明显，这卷胶片上反向记录了某个以现实的速度流逝的时间。汪淼马 上明白了它是什么。 一个倒计时。 倒计时从 1200 小时开始，到现在还剩余 1194 小时。 现在？不， 是拍完胶卷最后一张那一时刻。 这个倒计时还在继续吗？ 汪淼走出暗室，取出一只新的黑白胶卷装到莱卡相机上，在房间里 飞快地随意拍摄起来，最后又到阳台上拍了几张室外的画面。胶卷拍完 后，他把它从相机里取出来，一头钻进暗室冲洗。冲出来的胶片上，那 数字幽灵般地在每一张底片上不断显示出来， 第一张是 1187:27:39 ，从 上 中国科幻基石丛书 22 一卷最后一张拍摄到拍这卷的第一张，正好是间隔这么长时间。以后的 每一张的计时间隔为三到四秒， 1187:27:35 、1187:27:31 、1187:27:27 、 1187:27:24 ……是他快速拍摄的间隔。 倒计时仍在继续。 汪淼再次给相机装上新胶卷，飞快地乱拍起来，有几张他是故意扣 上镜头盖拍的。当他将拍完的胶卷取出时，妻子和孩子回来了。在去冲 洗前，他给莱卡装上第三个胶卷，把相机递给妻子： “来，拍完这卷。 ” “拍什么？”妻子惊诧地看着丈夫。以前，他是绝不允许其他人碰自 己的相机，当然她和儿子对那玩意儿也没兴趣，在他们眼里，那是一个 两万多元买来的乏味的老古董。 “什么都行，随便拍。 ”汪淼把相机塞到妻子手中，一头钻进了暗 室。 “那，豆豆，我给你拍吧。 ”妻子把镜头对准了儿子。 汪淼的脑海中突然浮现出幽灵般的数字像一条张开的绞索横在孩 子面容前的幻象，他不由微微战栗了一下。 “不，别拍儿子，随便拍别的 什么吧。 ” 快门“咔嚓”一声，妻子拍了第一张，然后叫道： “这怎么按不动 了？”汪淼教妻子扳了一个手柄， “这样，每次都要倒卷。 ”然后钻进了 暗室。 “真麻烦。 ” 身为医生的妻子不能理解， 在千万级像素的数码相机 已经普及的今天，还有人用这种过时的昂贵玩意儿，而且拍的还是黑白 胶卷。 胶卷冲出来后，对着晕暗的红灯，汪淼看到那幽灵倒计时仍在继 续，在一张张随意拍出的混乱画面上，包括那几张扣着镜头盖拍的，清 晰地显示出： 1187:19:06 、1187:19:03 、1187:18:59 、1187:18:56 …… 妻子敲了两下暗室的门，告诉他拍完了。汪淼出门抓过相机，取胶 卷时他的手明显地在颤抖。不顾妻子异样的目光，他拿着胶卷又回到暗 室，死死地关上门。他干得很忙乱，显影液、定影液洒了一地，胶卷很快 地球往事 三体 23 冲出来了，他闭上双眼，默默祈祷：别出现，不管是什么，别在现在出现， 别轮到我…… 他用放大镜沿着湿漉漉的胶卷看去，倒计时消失了，底片上只有妻 子拍出的室内画面，在低速光圈下，她那不专业的操作拍出的画面一片 模糊，但汪淼觉得这是他看过的最赏心悦目的照片了。 汪淼走出暗室，长出一口气，发现汗水已浸湿了全身。妻子去厨房 做饭了，儿子也到自己的房间去玩，他一个人坐在沙发上，开始了稍微 冷静的思考。 首先，这组在不同的拍摄间隔精确地记录时间流逝，并显示出智能 迹象的数字，不可能是预留在胶片上的，只能是某种力量使其感光，那 会是什么呢？是相机的问题吗？是某种装置被有意无意地放置到了相机 中吗？他将镜头卸下来，把相机拆开，用放大镜仔细地观察着相机内部， 检查着每个一尘不染的光洁机件，没有发现任何异常。那么，联想到那 几张扣上镜头盖后拍摄的画面，最可能的感光源是外界某种穿透力很 强的射线，但这在技术上同样是不可能的：射线源在哪儿？如何瞄准？ 至少以现有技术而言，这种力量是超自然的。 为了进一步确定幽灵倒计时已经消失，汪淼又在莱卡相机中装上 了一个胶卷，开始一张张地随意拍起来。当这次的胶卷冲出来后，刚刚 稍微平静了一会儿的他又被推到了疯狂的边缘：幽灵倒计时又出现了， 从画面显示的时间看，它根本就没有停止过，只是在妻子拍的那卷上没 有显示而已。 1186:34:13 、1186:34:02 、1186:33:46 、1186:33:35 …… 汪淼冲出暗室，冲出家门，猛敲邻居的门，开门的是退休的张教授。 “老张，你家有没有相机？哦，不要数码的，要用胶卷的！ ” “你这大摄影家朝我借相机？那个两万多的坏了？我只有数码的 ……你不舒服？脸色这么难看。 ” “借我用用。 ” 老张很快拿来一架很普通的柯达数码相机。 “给，里面的几张删掉 中国科幻基石丛书 24 就行……” “谢谢！ ”汪淼抓过相机和胶卷，匆匆返回屋里。其实家里还有三架 胶卷相机和一架数码相机，但汪淼觉得从别处借更可靠些。他看着摊放 在沙发上的两架相机和几只黑白胶卷，略一思考后，又给莱卡装上了胶 卷，然后将数码相机递给正在端饭的妻子： “快，拍几张，就像刚才一样！ ” “这是干什么？看你的脸色……你到底怎么了？！ ” 妻子惊恐地望着 他。 “你别管，拍！ ” 妻子放下手中的碟子，走过来看着丈夫，眼中的惊恐又加上了忧 虑。 汪淼把柯达相机塞到过来吃饭的六岁儿子手里， “豆豆， 你帮爸爸 拍。 就按这个， 对， 这是一张； 再按一下， 对对， 又是一张； 就这样一直拍， 对着哪儿都行。 ” 儿子很快掌握了，小家伙很感兴趣，拍得很快。汪淼转身从沙发上 拿起自己的莱卡，也拍了起来，父子俩就这样“咔嚓、咔嚓”地疯狂拍 着，丢下妻子在频频闪光中不知所措，眼泪涌了出来。 “汪淼，我知道你最近工作压力很大，你可别……” 汪淼把莱卡相机的胶卷拍完，又从孩子手中抢过数码相机。他想了 一下，为了避开妻儿的干扰，走到卧室中，自己用数码相机也拍了几张。 他拍的时候用的是目视取景器，没用液晶屏，因为怕看到结果，虽然迟 早要看。 汪淼取出莱卡里的胶卷钻进暗室，紧紧地关上门工作起来。冲洗完 成后，他细看底片，因手在颤抖，他只能用双手握着放大镜底片上， 幽灵倒计时在继续。 汪淼冲出暗室，开始检查数码相机上的照片，从液晶屏上看到，刚 才拍的数码照片中，儿子拍的部分没有显示倒计时；而在自己拍的那部 分，倒计时清晰地显示出来，并且与底片上的同步变化。 地球往事 三体 25 汪淼使用不同的相机拍摄，目的是排除问题出在相机或底片上的 可能性，但他无意中让孩子拍摄，加上之前让妻子拍摄，得出了一个更 加诡异的结果：用不同相机和不同胶卷拍摄，别人拍出的都正常，幽灵 倒计时只会在他拍摄的照片上出现！ 汪淼绝望地抓起那堆胶卷，像抓着一团纠缠在一起的蛇，又像一团 难以挣脱的绞索。 他知道，仅凭自己的力量是无法解决这个问题的，那么去找谁呢？ 大学和研究所里的同事是不行的，他们与自己一样，都是技术型思维的 人；直觉告诉他，这件事已超出了技术之外。他想到了丁仪，可现在这人 自己也陷入精神危机之中。他最后想到了“科学边界” ，那是一群思想 深刻而且活跃的人。于是，他拨通了申玉菲的电话。 “申博士，我这里有些事，必须到你那里去一趟。 ”汪淼急促地说。 “来吧。 ”申玉菲只说了这两个字就挂断了电话。 汪淼吃了一惊，申玉菲平时说话也十分精简，以至于“科学边界” 的一些人戏称她为“女海明威” 。但这次，她竟连是什么事都不问，汪淼 不知该感到安慰还是更加不安。 他将那团胶卷塞进一个提包，并带上那架数码相机，在妻子焦虑的 目光中冲出家门。本来可以开车去的，但即使在这灯火灿烂的城市，他 在路上也想有人陪伴，于是叫了出租车。 申玉菲住在新城铁线附近的一个高档别墅区，这里的灯光稀疏了 许多，别墅群环绕着几个能垂钓的小人工湖，晚上有一种乡村的感觉。 申玉菲显然很富有，但汪淼一直搞不清她的财产来源，她以前的研究职 位和现在公司中的职位都挣不到这么多钱。不过她的别墅中并没有豪 华享受的痕迹，那里是“科学边界”的一个聚会场所，其中的陈设很像 一个带会议室的小图书馆。 在客厅里，汪淼见到申玉菲的丈夫魏成。这个四十岁左右的男人， 一副敦厚的知识分子模样，汪淼对他的了解仅限于其姓名，申玉菲介绍 中国科幻基石丛书 26 时也只说了这些。他似乎没有工作，成天待在家里，对“科学边界”的讨 论不感兴趣，对家里频繁来往的学者们也习以为常。 但他并非无所事事，显然在家研究着什么东西，整天沉浸在思考 中，见到任何人都是心不在焉地打个招呼，然后回到楼上的房间里，他 一天的大部分时间都待在那里。一次，汪淼在楼上无意中从半开的房门 向里瞥了一眼，看到一个令人惊奇的东西：一台 HP小型机。他不会看 错的，因为这台设备与他工作的超导研究中心那台一样，黑灰色机箱， 是四年前出品的 RX8620 。把这台价值上百万的设备放在家里似乎很奇 怪，魏成每天一个人守着它到底在干什么？ “玉菲在上面有点事，您稍等一会儿吧。 ”魏成说，然后走上楼。汪 淼本打算等的，但实在坐不住，也跟着走上楼去，看到魏成正要进入他 那个放着小型机的房间。他看到汪淼跟来似乎并不反感，指指对面的一 个房间说： “哦，就在那个房间里，你去找她吧。 ” 汪淼敲门，门没锁，开了一个缝，他看到申玉菲正坐在电脑前玩游 戏，令汪淼惊奇的是她竟穿着一套“ V装具” 。这是目前在游戏玩家中 很流行的玩意儿，由一个全视角显示头盔和一套感应服构成，感应服可 以使玩家从肉体上感觉到游戏中的击打、刀刺和火烧，能产生出酷热和 严寒，甚至还能逼真地模拟出身体暴露在风雪中的感觉。汪淼走到她后 面，由于游戏是在头盔中以全视角方式显示的，在显示器上什么都看不 到。这时，汪淼想起大史让他记网址和邮件地址的事，无意中扫了一眼 显示器，那个游戏登录界面上的英文名很特别，他记住了。 申玉菲摘下显示头盔，又脱下了感应服，戴上她那副在瘦削的脸上 显得很大的眼镜，面无表情地对汪淼点点头，一个字都没说，等着他说 话。汪淼拿出那团胶卷，开始讲述发生在自己身上的诡异事件。申玉菲 注意听着，对那些胶片，只是拿起来大概扫了几眼，并没有细看，这 令汪淼很震惊，现在他进一步确定申玉菲对此事并非完全不知情，这几 乎令他停止了讲述，只是申玉菲几次点头示意他继续，才将事情讲完 了。这时申玉菲才说出了他们见面后的第一句话： 地球往事 三体 27 “你领导的纳米项目怎么样了？ ” 这不着边际的问题令汪淼十分吃惊。 “纳米项目？它与这有什么关 系？ ”他指指那堆胶卷。 申玉菲没有说话，只是静静地看着他，等他回答自己的问题。这就 是她的谈话风格，从不多说一个字。 “把研究停下来。 ”申玉菲说。 “什么？ ”汪淼认为自己听错了， “你说什么？ ” 申玉菲沉默着，没重复自己的话。 “停下来？ ！那是国家重点项目！ ” 申玉菲仍不说话，只是看着他，目光平静。 “你总得说出原因吧！ ” “停下来试试。 ” “你到底知道些什么？告诉我！ ” “我能告诉你的就这些了。 ” “项目不能停，也不可能停！ ” “停下来试试。 ” 关于幽灵倒计时的简短谈话就到此为止，之后，不管汪淼如何努 力，申玉菲再也没有说出一个与此有关的字，只是重复那句话： “停下 来试试。 ” “我现在明白了， ‘科学边界’ 并不是像你们宣称的那样是一个基 础理论的学术交流组织， 它与现实的关系比我想象的要复杂得多。 ”汪 淼说。 “相反，你得出这个印象，是因为‘科学边界’涉及的东西比你想 象的更基础。 ” 绝望的汪淼没有告辞起身就走，申玉菲默默地一直送他到庭院的 大门处，并看着他坐进出租车。正在这时，另一辆汽车疾驰而来，在门前 刹住了。一个男人下车，借着别墅中透出的灯光，汪淼一眼就认出了他。 这人是潘寒，是“科学边界”里最著名的人物之一。作为一名生物 中国科幻基石丛书 28 学家，他成功地预言了长期食用转基因农产品造成的后代遗传畸形，还 预言了转基因作物可能造成的生态灾难。与那些空洞地危言耸听的学 者不同，他的预言充满了具体的细节，且都一一精确兑现，其准确度达 到令人震惊的程度，以至于有传言说他来自未来。 他使自己闻名于世的另一个创举，是创建了国内第一个实验社会。 与西方那些旨在回归自然的乌托邦社团不同，他的“中华田园”不是处 于荒野之地，而是置身于最大的城市中。社团没有一分钱财产，包括食 物在内的所有生活用品，均来自城市垃圾。与人们最初的预想不同， “中华田园”不但生存下来，而且迅速壮大，其固定成员已达三千多人， 不定期到其中体验生活的人更是不计其数。 以这两个成功为基础，潘寒的社会思想也日益具有影响力。他认 为，科技革命是人类社会的一种病变，技术的爆炸性发展与癌细胞的飞 速扩散相当，最终的结果都是耗尽有机体的养分，破坏器官，导致其寄 宿体的死亡。他主张废除那些“粗暴的”技术，如化石能源和核电，保留 “温和的”技术，如太阳能和小水电。将大城市逐步解散，人口均匀分布 于自给自足的小村镇中，以“温和技术”为基础，建立“新农业社会” 。 “他在吗？ ”潘寒指指别墅的二楼问。 申玉菲没有回答，沉默地挡在他面前。 “我要警告他，当然也要警告你，别逼我们！ ”潘寒冷冷地说。 申玉菲仍没回答他，只是对出租车里的汪淼说： “走吧，没事。 ”然 后示意司机开车。车发动后，汪淼再也没有听到他们说什么，他回头远 远地看到，灯光下申玉菲一直没让潘寒走进别墅。 回到家已是深夜，汪淼在小区的门口走下出租车，一辆黑色桑塔纳 紧贴着他刹住，车窗摇下，一股烟喷了出来，是大史，粗壮的身躯将驾驶 座挤得满满的。 “哇，汪教授，汪院士！这两天过得可好？ ” “你在跟踪我？ 真无聊！ ” 地球往事 三体 29 “别误会，我要是直直开过去不就完了，讲个礼貌打个招呼你还当 成驴肝肺了。 ”大史露出他的特色傻笑，一副无赖相， “咋的，那边看到 什么有用的信息没，交流交流？ ” “我说过，我和你们没关系了，今后请不要跟踪我！ ” “得”大史开动了车子， “好像我愿意挣这俩夜班外勤费似 的，球赛都耽误了。 ” 汪淼走进家门，妻儿已经睡了，他听到妻子在床上不安地翻身，嘴 里发出模糊不清的声音，丈夫今天怪异的举动，不知会给她带来怎样的 噩梦。汪淼吃了两片利眠灵，躺到床上，过了很长时间才艰难地进入梦 乡。 他的梦境很纷乱，但其中的一个东西却恒定地存在着：幽灵倒计 时。其实，倒计时在梦中出现是汪淼早就预料到的事。梦境中，他疯狂地 击打悬浮在半空的倒计时，撕它、咬它，但一切击打都无力地穿透了它， 它就悬在梦境正中，坚定地流逝着。它使汪淼烦躁至极，终于从梦中醒 来。 他睁开眼，看到了模糊的天花板，外面城市的灯光透过窗帘，在上 面投出黯淡的光晕。但有一样东西从梦中跟随他到现实中：幽灵倒计 时。倒计时仍在他睁开的眼睛前显现，数字很细，但很亮，发出一种烧灼 的白光。 1185:11:34 、1185:11:33 、1185:11:32 、1185:11:31 …… 汪淼转转头，看到了卧室中模糊的一切，确认自己已经醒来，倒计 时没有消失。他闭上双眼，倒计时仍显现在他那完全黑暗的视野中，像 黑天鹅绒上发亮的水银。他再次睁眼，并揉揉眼睛，倒计时仍没有消失， 不管他的视线如何移动，那一串数字稳稳地占据着视野的正中央。 一股莫名的恐惧使汪淼猛地坐起来，倒计时死死跟随着他。他跳下 床，冲到窗前，扯开窗帘，推开窗。外面沉睡中的城市仍然灯光灿烂，倒 计时就在这广阔的背景前显现着，像电影画面上的字幕。 中国科幻基石丛书 30 一时间，汪淼感到自己窒息了，不由发出一声低沉的惊叫。面对被 惊醒的妻子恐慌的探问，他努力使自己镇定下来，安慰妻子说没什么， 又躺回床上，闭上眼睛，在幽灵倒计时的照耀下艰难地度过了剩下的夜 晚。 清晨起床后，汪淼努力使自己在家人面前显得正常些，但妻子还是 看出了异样，问他的眼睛怎么了？是不是看不清东西？ 早饭后，汪淼向纳米中心请了假，开车去医院。一路上，幽灵倒计时 无情地横在他眼中的现实世界前面，这东西会自动调节自己的亮度，在 不同的背景上都清晰地显现出来。汪淼甚至盯着初升的太阳，试图使倒 计时被强光暂时隐没一会儿，但没有用，那串魔鬼数字竟在日轮上显现 出来，这时它不是增加亮度，而是变成黑色，更加恐怖。 同仁医院很难挂号，汪淼直接找了妻子的一个同学，一位著名的眼 科专家。他没有说病情，而是先让医生检查自己的眼睛。仔细检查了汪 淼的双眼后，医生告诉他没有发现什么病变，眼睛一切正常。 “我的眼睛总是看见一个东西，不管你看哪里，这东西都在。 ”汪淼 说。同时，那串数字就横在医生脸前。 1175:11:34 、1175:11:33 、1175:11:32 、1175:11:31 …… “飞蚊症。 ”医生说，同时抽出处方签开始写， “我们这年纪的常见 眼病，晶状体混浊。不太好治，但没什么要紧的，开些碘药水和维 D吧， 也许能吸收掉，但希望不大。不过，这确实没什么要紧的，只要你习惯了 忽略视野里的那些杂物，对视力没什么影响。 ” “你说的飞蚊症，那些……东西看上去是什么样子？ ” “不规则，因人而易，有时是小黑点儿，有时像蝌蚪。 ” “如果看到的是一串数字呢？ ” 医生写处方的笔停了。 “你看到一串数字？ ” “是的，横在视野中心。 ” 医生推开纸和笔，关切地看着他， “一进来我就看出，你过度劳累。 上次同学聚会，李瑶向我提起你，说你的工作压力很大。到我们这岁数， 地球往事 三体 31 应该注意了，健康可透支不起了。 ” “你是说，我这是精神因素所致？ ” 医生点点头， “要是一般的病人，我就建议他去精神科了，其实没 必要，没什么要紧的，就是太累了。休息几天吧，去度几天假，和李瑶、孩 子，叫什么来着，豆豆吧，一起去。放心，很快会恢复的。 ” 1175:10:02 、1175:10:01 、1175:10:00 ，1175:09:59 …… “我告诉你我看到的是什么，一个倒计时！一秒一秒，在精确地走！ 这会是精神因素？ ” 医生宽容地笑笑， “想知道精神因素能对视力影响到什么程度吗？ 上个月我们收治了一个女孩儿，十五六岁吧，她在教室里突然间什么都 看不见了，完全失明。可经过所有检查，眼睛在生理上完全正常。后来精 神科的专家对她进行了一个月的心理治疗，又是突然间，她的眼睛恢复 到正常的视力。 ” 汪淼知道在这里是浪费时间，他起身要走，最后说： “好吧，不管我 的眼睛，我只有一个问题想请教你：有什么外力，能通过远程作用使人 看到什么吗？ ” 医生想了想说： “有，我前一阵儿参加神舟 19号的医疗组，曾有航 天员报告说，他们在舱外工作时看到了并不存在的闪光。以前国际空间 站上的航天员报告过类似情况，都是在太阳活动剧烈的时候，太空中的 高能粒子打到视网膜上，人就看到闪耀。不过你说的看到数字，还是倒 计时，绝无可能是这个原因。 ”汪淼恍惚地走出医院，倒计时就在他眼 前，他似乎在跟着它走，跟着一个死死缠着他的鬼魂。他买了一副墨镜 戴上，仅仅是为了不让别人看到自己梦游般迷离的眼神。 汪淼走进纳米中心的主体实验室，进门之前没忘记把墨镜摘下来， 尽管这样，遇见他的同事都对他的精神状态露出担心的神色。 在实验大厅中央，汪淼看到反应黑箱仍在运行中。这台巨型设备的 主体是汇集了大量管道的一个球体。代号叫“飞刃”的超强度纳米材料 已经生产出来，但是用分子建筑术制造的，就是用分子探针将材料分子 中国科幻基石丛书 32 像砌砖那样一个个垒砌起来，这样的工艺要耗费大量的资源，那些产品 可以说是世界上最贵重的珍宝了，根本无法进行量产。 实验室现在做的，就是试图通过一种催化反应来代替分子建筑法， 使巨量的分子在反应中同时完成筑砌。试验就是在反应黑箱中进行的， 这台设备可以在数量庞大的成分组合上进行反应试验，这样数量的组 合如果用传统的人工操作可能上百年也做不完，但在反应黑箱中可以 快速自动进行。同时，这是一种集现实反应与数字模拟一体化的设备， 当合成进行到一定程度时，计算机会根据反应的阶段性结果建立起合 成反应的数字模型，将剩下的反应进程用数字模拟代替，大大提高了实 验效率。 实验主任见到汪淼后，急匆匆走过来，开始汇报反应黑箱刚出现的 一系列故障。这是近来汪淼上班就遇到的事。现在，反应黑箱连续运 行了一年多，许多传感器灵敏度下降，误差增大，急需停机维护。但身为 项目首席科学家的汪淼坚持做完第三批合成组合再停机，工程师们只 好在反应黑箱上加入越来越多的补偿修正装置，到现在这些装置本身 也需要补偿修正，搞得整个项目组疲惫不堪。但主任小心翼翼地没提停 机和暂停试验的事，怕汪淼又像上几次那样大发雷霆。他只是把困难都 摆出来，意思也很明白。 汪淼抬头看看反应黑箱，觉得它像一个子宫，工程师们正围着它忙 碌，艰难地维持着正常的运行。在这场景前面，叠现着幽灵倒计时。 1174:21:11 、1174:21:10 、1174:21:09 、1174:21:08 …… 停下来试试。汪淼脑海中突然响起申玉菲的话。 “全面更新外围传感系统需要多长时间？ ”他问。 “四五天吧， ”实验主任突然看到了希望，赶紧加一句， “快些干， 三天就行，汪总，我保证！ ” 我并没有屈服，设备确实需要维修，因而试验必须暂停，与别的无 关。汪淼在心里对自己说，然后转向主任，透过倒计时的数字看着他， “把试验停下来吧，停机维修，就照你说的时间表。 ” 地球往事 三体 33 “好的汪总，我会很快给你一份更新方案，下午就能停机了！ ”主任 兴奋地说。 “现在就停吧。 ” 主任像不认识似的看着汪淼，但旋即恢复了兴奋状态，好像生怕失 掉这个机会似的。他拿起电话下了停机命令，项目组里那些疲惫的研究 员和工程师一下子都兴奋起来，开始按程序扳动上百个复杂的开关，众 多的监控屏一个接一个地黑了下来，最后，主监控屏上显示了停机状 态。 几乎与此同时，汪淼眼前的倒计时停止了走动，数字固定为 1174: 20:35 。几秒钟后，数字闪动了几下，消失了。 当没有幽灵倒计时覆盖的现实重现眼前时，汪淼长出了一口气，像 刚从水底挣扎出来一样。他无力地坐下，很快意识到旁边还有人在看着 他。 他对实验主任说： “系统更新是设备部的事，你们实验组的人好好 休息几天吧，这一阵大家都辛苦了。 ” “汪总，你也太累了，这里有张总工程师盯着，你也回家好好休息 一下吧。 ” “是啊，太累了。 ”汪淼无力地说，待他离开后，拿起电话，拨了申玉 菲的号码，只响了一声铃她就接了。 “你们背后是什么？ ”汪淼问，尽量使自己的声音冷静一些，但没有 做到。 沉默。 “倒计时的尽头是什么？ ” 沉默。 “你在听吗？ ” “在。 ” “高强度纳米材料怎么了？这不是高能加速器，只是一项应用研 究，值得这样关注么？ ” 中国科幻基石丛书 34 “什么值得关注，不应由我们来判断。 ” “够了！ ”汪淼大吼一声，心中的恐惧和绝望突然化为疯狂的怒 气，“你们以为这点小魔术就能骗得了我？就能阻止技术进步！ ？我承认 一时无法做出技术上的解释，但那是因为我还没有绕到那个可耻魔术 师的背后！ ” “你的意思，是想在更大的尺度上看到倒计时？ ” 申玉菲的话让汪淼愣了一下，他对这个问题没有准备，于是强迫自 己冷静下来，以免落入圈套。 “收起你那套把戏吧。大尺度又怎么样，你 们同样可以玩魔术！可以向天空投映全息图像，就像上一次战争中北约 做的那样，强力激光甚至可以将图像映满整个月球表面！射手和农场主 应该能够玩弄人类力不能及的更大尺度，比如，倒计时能够显示到太阳 表面吗？”话刚说完，汪淼吃惊地张大了嘴，他竟在下意识中说出了那 两个这时应十分忌讳的名词，还好，没有说出更忌讳的那个。他想争取 更多的主动性，于是接着说， “考虑到某种我还没想到的可能性，即使 在太阳的尺度上，你们那个可耻魔术师仍有可能耍魔术，那种力量要真 正令人信服，显示的尺度还需更大些。 ” “问题是你能承受得了吗？我们是朋友，我想帮你，别走杨冬的 路。” 听到这个名字，汪淼不由打了个寒战，但随之而来的愤怒又使他不 顾一切了： “能接受这个挑战吗？ ” “能。 ” “你想怎么样？ ”汪淼的声音变得无力了。 “你旁边有上网的电脑吗？好，进这个网址： http://www.qsl. net/bg3tt/zl/mesdm.htm ，打开了吗？把网页打印出来，随身带着。 ” 汪淼看到网页上显示的只是一张莫尔斯电码对照表。 “我不明白，这是……” “在以后的两天内，设法找到一个能够观测宇宙背景辐射的地方。 具体的请看我随后发给你的电子邮件。 ” 地球往事 三体 35 “这是……干什么呢？ ” “我知道纳米研究项目已经停了，你打算重新启动它吗？ ” “当然，三天以后。 ” “那倒计时将继续。 ” “我将在什么尺度上看到它？ ” 沉默良久，这个为某种超出人类理解力的力量代言的女人，冷酷地 封死了汪淼的一切出路。 “三天后，也就是十四日，在凌晨一点钟至五点钟，整个宇宙将为 你闪烁。 ”,"6 T h e S h o o t e r a n d t h e F a r m e r The nex t day was the start of the weekend. W ang got up early and left on his bicy cle. As a hobby photographer , his favorite subjects were wildernesses fre e of human presence. But now that he was middle-aged, he no longe r had the ener gy to eng age in such indulgent travel and only shot city scenes. Consciously or subconsciously , he usually chose corners of the city that held som e aspec t of the wild: a dried lakebed in a park, the fre shly turned soil of a construction site, a weed struggling out of cracks in cement. In order to eliminate the busy col ors of the city in the background, he only used black-and- white film. Unexpectedly , he had developed his own style and had gained some notice. His works had been select ed for two exhibitions, and he was a member of the Photographers Associa tion. Every time he went ou t to take pictures , he would ride his bike and wander around the city in sear ch of inspiration and compositions that caugh t his fancy . Often he would be out all day . T oday , W ang felt strange. His photography style tended toward the classical, calm and dignified. But today he could not seem to get in the mood ne cessary for such compositions. In his mind, the city , as it awoke from its slumber , seemed to be built on quicksand. The stability was illusory . All night long, he had dreamt of those two billiard balls . They flew around a dark space without any pattern, the black one disappea ring againstthe black background and only revealing its existence occasionally when it obscured the white ball. Can the fundamental natur e of matter r eally be lawlessness? Can the stability and or der of the world be but a temporary dynamic equilibrium achieved in a corner of the universe, a short-lived eddy in a chaotic curr ent? W ithout realizing it, he found himself at the foot of the newly completed China Central T elevision building. He stopped at the side of the road and lifted his head to gaze up at this gigantic A-shaped tower , trying to recapture the feeling of stabilit y . His gaze followed the sharp tip of the building, gleam ing in the morning sunlight, pointing toward the blue, bottomless depths of the sky . T wo words suddenly floated into his consciousness: “shooter” and “farmer .” When th e members of the Fron tiers of Science discussed physics, they often us ed the abbreviation “SF .” They didn’ t mean “science fiction,” but the two words “shooter” and “farmer .” This was a refere nce to two hypotheses, bot h involving the fundamental nature of the laws of the universe. In th e sh ooter hy pothesis, a good marksman shoots at a tar get, c reating a hole ev ery ten centimeters. Now suppose the surface of the tar get is inhabited by intelligent, two-di mensional creatures. Their scie ntists, after observing the universe, discover a great law: “There exists a hole in the universe every ten centimeters .” They have mistaken the result of the marksman’ s momentary whim for an unalterable law of the universe. The farmer hypothesis, on the other hand, has the flavor of a horror story: Every morning on a turkey farm, the farmer comes to feed the turkeys. A scientist turkey , having observed this pattern to hold without change f or almost a year , make s the following discovery: “Every morning at eleven, food arrives.” On the morning of Thanksgiving, the scientist announces this law to the other turkeys. But that morning at e leven, food doesn’ t arrive; instead, the farmer comes and kills the entire flock. W ang felt the ro ad beneath his feet shift like quicksand. The A -shaped building seemed to wobble and sway . He quickly brought his gaze back to the street. * * *T o get rid of the anxiety , W ang forced himself to finish a roll of film. He returned home before lunch. His wife had taken their son out and wouldn’ t be back for a while. Usually , W ang would rush to develop th e film, but today he wasn’ t in the mood. After a quick and simple lunch, he went to take a nap. Because he hadn’ t slept well the night before, by the time he woke up it was almost five. Finally remembering the roll of film he had shot, he went into the cramped darkroom he had converted from a closet. The film developed. W ang began to look through the negatives to see if any sho ts were worth printing, but he saw something strange in the very first ima ge. The shot was of a small lawn outside a lar ge shopping center . The center of the negative held a line of tiny white marks, which, upon closer examination, turned out to be numbers: 1200:00:00. The second picture also had numbers: 1 199:49:33, as did the third: 1 199:40:18. In fact, every picture in the roll had such numbers, until the thirty-sixth (and last) image: 1 194:16:37. W ang’ s first thought was that so mething was wrong with the fi lm. The camera he had used was a 1988 Leica M2entirely mechanical, which made it impossi ble for it to add a date stamp. Given the excellent lens and refined mechanical operation, it was considered a great professional camera even in this digital age. After reexamining the negatives, W ang discovered another strange thing about the numbers: They see med to adapt to the background. If the background was black, the numbers were white, and vice versa. The shift seemed designe d to maximize the numbers’ contrast for visibility . By the time W a ng saw the sixteenth negative, his heart was beating faster , and a chill crept up his spine. This shot was of a dead tree aga inst an old wall. The wall was mottled, showing a pattern of alternating black and white patches on the negative. Given this background, either white or black numbers would have been hard to read. Bu t in the picture, the numbers arranged themselv es vertically to fit along the curve of the tree trunk, allowing the white numbers to show up against the dark coloring of the dead tree like a crawling snake. W ang began to a nalyze the mathematical pattern in the numbers . At first he thought it w as some kind of assigned numbering, but the dif ference between the numbers wasn’ t co nstant. He then guessed that t he numbersrepresented time in the form of hours, minutes, and seconds. He took out his s hooting diary , in which he r ecorded the exact time he took each picture down to the min ute, and discovered the dif ference between two successive numbers on the photographs corresponded to the dif ference in time between when they were taken. A countdown. The countdown began with 1,200 hours. And now there wer e about 1,194 hours left, just under 50 days. Now? N o, at the moment I took the last photograph. Is the countdown still pr oceeding? W ang walked out of the darkroom, loaded a new roll of film in the Leica, a nd bega n to snap rando m shots. He even walked onto the balcony for a few outdoor shots. Afterwa rd, he took out the film and we nt back into the darkroom. In the developed roll, the numbers again appear ed on every negative like ghosts. The first one was marked 1 187:27:39. The dif ference matched the passage of time between the last shot of the last roll and the first shot of thi s roll. After that, the number decreased by three or four seconds in each image: 1 187:27:35, 1 187:27:31, 1 187:27:27, 1 187:27:24 … just like the intervals between the quick shots he had taken. The countdown continued. W ang again loaded a new roll o f film. He snapped of f the shots rapidly , even tak ing a few with the lens cap on. As he took out the roll of film, his wife and son returned. Before he went into the darkroom to develop the film, he loaded another roll of f ilm in the Leica and handed it to his wife. “Here, finish the roll for me.” “What a m I supposed to shoot?” His wife looked at him, ama zed. He never allowed anyone to touch h is camera, though she and their son had no interest in doing so either . In their eyes, it was a boring antique that cost more than twenty thousand yuan. “Doesn’ t matter . Just shoot whatever you want.” W ang stuf fed the camera into her hands and ducked into the darkroom. “All righ t. Dou Dou, why don’ t I take some pictures of you?” His wife aimed the camera at their son. W ang’ s mind suddenly filled with the imagined sight of the ghostlike figures appearing over his son’ s face like a hangman’ s noose. He shuddered. “No, don’ t do that. Shoot something else.”The shu tter clicked, and his wife had taken her first shot. “Wh y can’ t I press it again?” she asked. W ang taught her how to wind the film to advance it. “Like that. Y ou have to do it after every shot.” Then he ducked back into the darkroom. “So complicated!” His wife, a d octor , couldn’ t understand why anyone would use such expensive bu t outdated equipment when ten- or even twenty-megapixel digital cameras were common. And he even used black- and-white film. After th e third roll of film deve loped, W ang held it up against the red light. He saw that the ghostlike countdown continued. The numb ers showed up c learly on ev ery randomly shot picture, including the few he had taken with the lens cap on: 1 187:19:06, 1 187:19:03, 1 187:18:59, 1 187:18:56 … His wife knocked on the darkroom door and told him she was finished with the roll. W ang opened the door and took the camera from her . As he took out the roll, his hands trembled. Ignoring his wife’ s concerned look, he took the film back into the darkroom and shut the door . He wor ked fast and clumsily , spillin g developer and fixer all over the ground. Soon the images were developed. He closed his eyes, silently praying, Please don’ t appear . No matter what, please don’ t appear now . Don’ t make it my turn.… He exam ined the wet film wi th a magnifying glass. There was no countdown. The negatives held only the interior shots his wife had taken. She had used a slow shutter speed, and her amateurish operation left all the scenes blurry . But W ang thought these were the most enjoyable pictures he had ever seen. W ang came out of the darkroo m and let out a held breath. He was covered in sweat. His wife wa s in the kitchen cooking, and his son was playing in his room. He sat on the sofa and thought the matte r over more rationally . First, the numbers, which pre cisely recorded the passage of time between shots and which show ed signs of intelligence, could n ot possibly have bee n prepr inted on the fil m. Something exp osed them o nto the film. But wha t? Did the camera have a malfunction? Had some mechanism been installed in the camera without his knowledge? He took of f the lens and disassembled the camera. He examined the interior with a magnifying glass and chec ked every dustless component without discovering any thing out of place. T hen, considering that the numbers showed up even i n the shotstaken with the lens cap on, he realized the most likely light source was some kind of pe netrating ray . But how was this technologically possible? Where was the source of the rays? How could they have been aimed? At least given current technology , such power would be supernatural. In o rder to see if the ghostly countdown had disappeared, W ang loaded another roll into the Leica, and again began to shoot randomly . When this roll was developed, W ang’ s short-lived calm was again shattered. He felt himself pushed to the precipice of madness. The countdown h ad returned. Based on the numbers, it had never stopped, just failed to display on the roll shot by his wife. 1 186:34:13, 1 186:34:02, 1 186:33:46, 1 186:33:35 … W ang ru shed ou t of the darkroom and continued through the do or of the apartment. He knocked loudly o n the door of his neighbor , retired Professor Zhang. “Professor Zhang, do you have a camera? Not a digital one, but one that takes film!” “A professional photographer like you wants to borrow my camera? What happened to your expensive one? I have only digital point-and-shoots. Are you okay? Y our face looks so pale.” “Please, let me borrow it.” Zhang returned with a common Kodak digital camera. “Here you go. Y ou can just delete the few pictures already on there.” “Thank you!” W ang seized the camera and rushed back home. He actually had three more film cameras and a digital one, but W ang thought it better to borrow a camera from someone else. He looked at his own camera lying on the sofa and the few ro lls of film, paused in thought, and decided to reload the Leica with new film. He handed the borrowed digital camera to his wife, who was setting out dinner . “Quick! Shoot another few pictures, like before.” “What are you doing? Look at your face! What’ s happening?” “Don’ t worry about it. Shoot!” She put down th e dishes and cam e over to him, her eyes filled with both worry and fright. W ang st uf fed the Kodak into the hands of his six-year -old son, who was about to start eating dinner . “Dou Dou, come help Daddy . Push this button.Right, li ke that. That’ s one shot. Push it again. That’ s another sh ot. Keep on shooting like that. Y ou can take pictures of anything you want.” The boy learned quickly . He wa s very interested and made rapid shots. W ang turned around and picked up the Leica from the couch, and began to shoot as well. The father and son kept on pressing the shutter s as though they were mad. His wife, not k nowing what to do as the flashes went of f around her , began to cry . “W ang Miao, I k now that you’ve been under a lot of pressure lately , but please, I hope you haven’ t…?” W ang fin ished the roll in the Leica and grabbed the digital from his son. He thou ght for a moment, and th en, in order to avoid his wife, went into the bedroom and took a few more shots with the digital. He used the optical finder instead of the LCD becau se he was afraid to see the results, though he was going to have to face them soon enough. W ang took out the film from the Leica and went back into the darkroom. He shut the door and worked. After the film was developed, he examined the imag es care fully . Because his hands were shaking, he had to hold the magnifying glass with both hands. On the negatives, the countdown continued. W ang rushed out of the darkroom and began to look through the digital images on the K odak. On the L CD, he saw that the pictures his son had taken did not h ave the numbers, but in the pictures that he took, the countdown show ed clearly and was synchronized with the numbers on the film. By u sing dif ferent cameras, W an g was trying to eliminate proble ms with the came ra or the film as possible explanations. But by allowing his son and his wife to take some pictures, he discovered an even stranger result: The countdown only appeared on the pictures he took! Desperate, W ang picked up the pile of film rolls, like a tangled nest of snakes, like a bunch of ropes tied into an impossible knot. He knew that he could not solve the mystery on his own. Who could he turn to? His old classmates from college and his colleagues at the Research Center were hopeless. Like him , they were all people with technical minds. Intuitively , he knew that this went beyond a technical problem. He thought of Ding Y i, but that man was now in a spiritual crisis of his own. Finally , hethought of the Frontiers of S cience. These were deep thinkers who remained open-minded. So he dialed Shen Y ufei’ s number . “Dr . Shen, I have a problem. I must see you.” “Come over ,” Shen said, and hung up. W ang w as surp rised. Shen was a woman of few words. Some in the Frontiers of Science jokingly c alled her the Female Hemingway . But the fact that she didn’ t even ask him what was wrong made W ang uncertain whether he should be comforted or even more anxious. He stuf f ed the mess of film into a bag, and, taking the digital camera, rushed o ut of the apartment as his wife watched him anxiously . He could have dri ven, but even with the city being full of lights, he wante d to be with people. He called for a cab. * * * Shen liv ed in a luxury housing d evelopment reachable by one of the newer commuter rails. Here, the lights were much dimmer . The houses were set around a small artificial lake sto cked with fish for the residents, and at night the place felt like a village. Shen wa s clearly well of f, but W ang could never figure out the s ource of her wealth. Neither her old research position nor her current job with a private c ompany could earn that much income. But her house didn’ t show signs of luxury on the inside. It was used as a gathering pl ace for the Frontiers of Science, and W ang always thought it resembled a s mall library with a meeting room. In the living room, W ang saw W ei Cheng, Shen’ s husband. W ei was about fo rty year s old and had the look of a staid, honest intellectual. W ang knew lit tle about him other than his name. Shen hadn’ t said muc h when she introduced him. He didn’ t seem to have a job, since he stayed home all day . He neve r showed any interest i n the Frontiers of Science discussions, but seemed used to the sight of so many scholars coming to their house. But he wasn’ t idle. He appeared to be conducting some kind of research at home, always deep in thought. Whenever he met any visitor , he would greet them absentmindedly and then return to his room upstairs. Most of his day was spent there. One time, W ang glanced into his room through the half-open door and saw an asto nishing sight: a powerful HP w orkstation.He was sure of w hat he saw because the workstation was the sam e model as the one he used at the Research Center: slate-gray chassis, model RX8620, four years old. It seemed very strange to own a machine costing more than a million yuan just for personal use. What was W ei Cheng doing with it all day? “Y ufei is a bit bu sy right now . Why don’ t you wait a while?” W ei Cheng walked upstairs. W ang tried to wait, but he found that he couldn’ t be still, so he f ollowed W ei Cheng. W ei was about to enter his room with the workstation whe n he saw W ang behind him, but he didn’ t seem annoyed. He pointed to the room across from his. “She’ s in there.” W ang k nocked on the door . It wasn’ t locked, and it opened a crack. Shen was seated in front of a computer , playing a game. He w as surprised to see that she wore a V -suit. The V -su it was a very popular p iece of equipment among gamers, made up o f a panoram ic viewing helmet and a haptic feedback suit. The suit allowed the player to experience the sensations of the game: being struck by a fist, being stab bed by a knife, being burned by flames, and so on. It was also cap able of generating feelings of extreme heat and cold, even simulating the sensation of being exposed in a snowstorm. W ang w alked be hind her . As the game was displayed only on the inside of the panoram ic viewing helmet, there were no colorful im ages on the computer monitor . W ang suddenly remembered Shi Qiang’ s comment about memorizing W eb and e-mail addresses. He glanced at the monitor . The game site’ s URL caught his attention: www .3body .net. Shen took of f the helmet and stripped of f the haptic feedback suit. She put on her glasses, which appeared extra lar ge against her thin face. W ithout any exp ression, she nodded at W ang and said nothing. W ang t ook out the mess of film rolls and began to explain his strange experience. Shen paid full attention to his story , picking up the rolls of film and only casually looking at them. This surprised W ang, but further confirmed f or him that Shen wa sn’ t completely ignora nt about what he was going through. He almost stopped speaking, but Shen kept on nodding at him, indicating that he should continue. When h e finished, Shen spoke for the first time. “How’ s the nanomaterial project you’re leading proceeding?”This non sequitur disoriented W ang. “The nanomaterial project? What does that have to do with this?” He pointed at the rolls of film. Shen did n’ t ans wer , but continued to stare at him, waiting for him to answer her question. This was always her style, never wasting a single word. “Stop your research,” she said. “What?” W ang wasn’ t sure h e heard right. “What are you talking about?” Shen remained silent. “Stop? That’ s a key national project!” Shen still said nothing, only looking at him calmly . “Y ou have to give me a reason.” “Just stop. T ry it.” “What do you know? T ell me!” “I’ve told you all I can.” “I can’ t stop the project. It’ s impossible!” “Just stop. T ry it.” That was the end of the conversation about the countdown. After that, no matter how hard W ang tried, Shen only repeated, “Just stop. T ry it.” “I under stand now ,” W ang said. “The Frontiers of Science isn’ t just a discussion group about fundamental theory , like you claimed. Its connection to reality is far more complicated than I had imagined.” “No. It’ s the o pposite. Y our impression is due to the fact that the Frontiers of Science concerns matters far more fundamental than you imagine.” Desperate, W ang got up to leave without saying good-bye. Mute ly , Shen accompanied him to the door and watched as he got into the taxi. Just then, another car drove up and braked to a hard stop in front of the door . A man g ot out. By the faint light leaking from the h ouse, W ang recognized him immediately . The man was Pan Han, one of the most prominent members of the Frontiers of Science. A biologist, he had successfully predicted the birth defects associated with long-term consumption of genetically modified foods. He had a lso predicted the ecological disasters that would come with cultivation of genetically modified crops. Unlike the prophets of doom who regularly warned of catastrophes without any particulars, Pan madepredictions that always gave many specific details that later turned out to be correct. His accuracy was such that there were rumors that he came from the future. The other cause for his fame was that he had created Chin a’ s first experimental community . Unlike the “return to nature” utopia n groups in the W est, his “Pastoral China” wasn’ t located in the wilderness, but in the midst of one of its lar gest cities. The community had no property of its own. Everything needed for daily life, including food, came from urban trash. Contrary to the predictions of many , Pastoral China not only survived, but thrived. Current ly , it had more than three thousand permanent members, and countless others had joined for short stints to experience the lifestyle. Based on these two successes , Pan’ s opinions on social iss ues had grown m ore and more influential. He believed that technological progress was a disease in human society . The explosive development of technology was analogous to the growth of cancer cells, and the results would be identical: the exhaustion of all sources of nourishment, the destruction of or gans, and the final death of the host body . He advocated abolishing crude technologies suc h as fossil fuels and nuclear ener gy and keep ing gentler technologies suc h as solar power and small-scale hydroelectric power . He believed in the gradual de-urbanization of modern metropolises by distributing the population mor e evenly in self-suf ficient small towns and villages. Relyin g on the gentler technologies, he would build a new agricultural society . “Is he in?” Pan asked Shen, pointing to the house. Shen didn’ t answer , but blocked his progress. “I have to warn him and also warn you. Do not force our hand.” Pan’ s voice was cold. Shen called to th e taxi driver , “Y ou can go now .” After the taxi started, W ang couldn’ t hear any more of the conversation between Sh en and Pan, but he glanced back and saw that Shen did not let Pan into the house. * * * By the time W an g arrived home, it was already after midnight. A s W ang got out of the taxi, a black V olkswagen Santana braked to a stop n ext to him.The win dow rol led down and a cloud of smoke emer ged. Shi Qiang’ s thick body filled the driver ’ s seat. “Professor W an g! Academician W ang!14 H ow’v e you been the last couple of days?” “Are you following me? Don’ t you have anything better to do?” “Now , don’ t misunderstand me. I could have just driven past you, but instead, I chose to be polite and stop to greet you. Y ou’re makin g being nice a t hankle ss task.” Shi revealed his trademark roguish smirk. “W e ll? Did you find out any useful information over there?” “I’ve told you already , I don’ t want anything to do with you. Please leave me alone from now on.” “Fine.” Shi started the car . “It’ s not like I’m going to starve wit hout the overtime for doing this. I’d rather not have missed my soccer match.” * * * W ang entered the apartment. His wife was already asleep. He could hear her tossing and turning in bed, m umbling anxiously . Her husband’ s strange behavior during the day was surely giving her bad dreams. W ang swallowed a few sleeping pills, lay down on the bed, and, after a long wait, fell asleep. His dre ams were chaotic, but there was one constant: the ghostly countdown, suspended in midair . Even before he fell asleep, he had known he w ould dream of it. In his dreams, he attacked the countdown . Crazed, he tore at it, bit it, but every attem pt failed to leave a mark. It continued to hang in the middle of his dream, steadily ticking away . Finally , just as the frustration became almost intolerable, he woke up. Opening his eyes, he saw the ceiling, indistinct above him. T he city lights ou tside th e window cast a dim glow against it through t he curtains. But one thing did follow him f rom dream into reality: the co untdown. It was still hoverin g before his ey es. The numbers were thin, but very bright with a burning, white glow . 1 180:05:00, 1 180:04:59, 1 180:04:58, 1 180:04:57 … W ang looked around, taking in t he blurry shadows around the b edroom. He was now certain that he was awake, but the countdown did not disappear . He shut his eyes, and the countdown remained in the darkness of his vision, looking like mercury flowing against a black swan’ s feathers. Heopened his eyes, rubbed them, a nd still the countdown did not go away . No matter how he moved his gaze, the numbers stayed at the center of it. A na meless terror made W ang sit up. The countdown clung to him. He jumped of f the bed, tore the curtains apart, and pushed the window open. The city , deep in sleep, was still brightly lit. The countdown hov ered before this grand background like subtitles on a movie screen. W ang fe lt he was suf focating. He let out a stifled scream. H is wife, frightened awak e, questioned him anxiously . He tried to force h imself to be calm and comfo rted her , telling her that it was nothing. He lay back on the bed, closed his eyes, and spent the rest of his dif ficult nigh t under the constant glow of the countdown. In th e morning, he tried to act normal in front of his family , but he could not fool his wife . She asked him whether his eyes were all right, whether he could see clearly . After br eakfast, W ang called the Research Center and asked for the day of f. He drove to the hospital. Along the way , the countdown mercilessly hovered in front of the real world. It was able to adjust its brightness so that, no m atter what t he background, it showed up distinctly . W ang even tried to temporarily over whelm the display by staring into the rising sun. But it was useless. The infernal numbers t urned black and showed up aga inst the orb of the sun like projected shadows, which made them even more frightening. T ongren Hospita l was very bus y , but W ang was able to see a famous ophthalmologist who had gone to school with his wife. He asked the doctor to te st him, with out describing the symptoms. After careful examination of both eye s, the doctor told him th ey were functioning normally with no signs of any disease. “There’ s someth ing stuck in m y vision. No matter where I look, it’ s always there.” As W ang said this, the numbers hovered in front of the doctor ’ s face. 1 175:1 1:34, 1 175:1 1:33, 1 175:1 1:32, 1 175:1 1:31 … “Oh, you’re talking about floate rs.” The doctor took out a prescription pad and began to write. “They’re common at our age, the result of clouding in the lens. They’re not easy to cure, but they’re also not a big deal. I’ll give you som e iodine drops and vita min Dit’ s possible that they’ll go away , but don ’ t get your hopes up to o much. Really , they’re nothing to worryabout, as they do n’ t af fect your v ision. Y ou just have to get used to ignoring them.” “Floaters … Can you tell me what they look like?” “There’ s no real pattern. It dif fers by person. For some, they a ppear as tiny black dots; for others, like tadpoles.” “What if someone sees a series of numbers?” The doctor ’ s pen stopped. “Y ou see numbers?” “Y es, right in the middle of the visual field.” The do ctor pushed his pen and paper away , and looked at him sympathetically . “As soon as you came in, I could tell you’d be en working too much. At the last class reunion, Li Y ao told me you were under a lot of pressure at work. W e have to be careful at our age. Our health is no longer what it used to be.” “Y ou are saying this is due to psychological factors?” The doctor nodded. “If it was anyone else, I’d suggest you g o see a psychiatrist. But it’ s nothing serious, just exhaustion. Why don’ t you rest for a few days? T ake a vacation. Go be with Y ao and your kidwhat’ s his name … Dou Dou, right? No worries. They’ll go away soon.” 1 175:10:02, 1 175:10:01, 1 175:10:00, 1 175:09:59 … “Let me tell you what I see. It’ s a countdown! One second after another , it keeps on ticking precisely . Are you saying this is all in my head?” The doc tor gave him a tolerant smile. “Y ou know how much the mind can af fe ct vision? Last month we had a patienta girl, maybe fifteen, sixteen. She was in class when she suddenly lost the ability to see, went completely blind. But all the te sts showed that there was nothing wrong with her eyes physiologically . Finally , someone from the Department of Psychiatry treate d her with psyc hotherapy for a month. All of a sudden, her vision returned.” W ang knew that he was wastin g his time here. He got up. “All right, let’ s not talk about my eyes anymore. I have one last questi on: Do you know of any physical phenomenon that can operate from a distance and make people see visions?” The doctor gave this some thoug ht. “Y es, I do. A while ago I was part of the med ical team for the Shenzh ou 19 spacecraft. Some taikonauts engaged in e xtravehicula r activities reported seeing flashes that didn’ t exist. The astronauts on the International Space Station reported similar experiences.It was because d uring periods of intense solar activity , high-ener gy particles struck against the retina, causin g them to see flashes. But you’re talking about numbersa countdown, even. Solar activity can’ t possibly cause that.” W ang w alked ou t of the hospita l in a daze. The countdown continued to hover in his eye s, and he seemed to be following the numbers, following a ghost that would not leave him. He bought a pair of sunglas ses and put them on so that others would no t see his eyes wandering around as though he were sleepwalking. Before e ntering the main lab at the Nanotechnology Research Center , W ang to ok of f his sunglasses. Even so, his colleagues noticed his apparent mental state and gave him concerned looks. W ang saw that t he main reaction chamber in the middle of the lab was still in operation. The main compartment of the gigantic appa ratus was a sphere with many pipes connected to it. They ha d made small quantities of a new , ultrastrong nanomaterial that they’d given the code name “Flying Blade.” But the samples so far were all made with molecular construction techniquesthat is, using a nanoscale molecular probe to stack the molecules one by one, like laying out bricks for a wall. This method was ve ry resource-intensive, and the results might as well have been the world’ s m ost precious jewels. It was im practical to produce lar ge quantities this way . At th e m oment, the lab was attem pting to develop a catalytic rea ction as a su bstitute for molecular const ruction so that lar ge numbers o f molecules would stack themselves into t he right arrangement. The main reaction chamber could rapidly run through a lar ge number of reactions using dif ferent molecular combinations. There were so many combinations that normal manual testing method s would have taken more than a hundred years. In addition, the apparatus augmented actual reactions with mathematical simulations. When the reaction reached a certai n stage, the computer would build a mathematical model of it based on intermediate products and finish the remain der of the reaction via simu lation. This greatly boosted the experimental ef ficiency . When th e lab director saw W an g, he hurried over and began to report a series of malfunctions with the main reaction chambera recent ritual whenever W ang arrived at wor k. By now the main reaction chamber hadbeen in continuo us operation for more than a year , and many sensors had lost sens itivity , r esulting in measurement errors that required shutting down the apparatus for maintenance. But as the lead scientist on the project, W ang insisted that the machine would not be shut down until the third set of molecular comb inations was finished. The technicians had no choice but to jury-rig more and more kludges onto the main reaction chamber to compensate. An d now those klu dges required their own kludges, a state of af fairs that exhausted the project staf f. But the lab director carefully avoided the topic of shutting down the machine and temporarily halting the experiment, as he knew that such discussions tend ed to enrage W ang Miao. He just laid out the dif ficulties before W ang, though his unspoken desire was clear . Engineers rushed around the main reaction chamber like doctors around a critica l patient, trying to keep it going for a little longer . In front of the whole scene, the countdown appeared. 1 174:21:1 1, 1 174:21:10, 1 174:21:09, 1 174:21:08 … Just stop. T ry it. Shen’ s words came to W ang. “How lo ng would it take to completely overhaul the sensors? ” W ang asked. “Four or five days.” Now that the lab director saw a ray of hope, he quickly added, “If we work fast, it will take only three days. I guarantee it, Chief W ang!” I’m not giving in, W ang though t. The eq uipment r eally needs maintenance, so the experiment must be temporarily stoppe d. This has nothing to do with anything else . He turned to the lab director and focused on h im through the hovering co untdown. “Shut down the experiment and perform the maintenance. Follow the schedule you gave me.” “Absolutely , Ch ief W ang. I’ll give you an updated schedule rig ht away . W e can stop the reaction this afternoon!” “Y ou can stop it right now .” The lab director stared at him in disbelief, but soon he was excited again, a s if afraid to lose this opportunity . He picked up the phone and issued the order to stop the reaction. All the exhausted rese archers and technicians grew excited, too. They immediately began the procedures to shut down the main reaction chamber , flipping a hundred complex switches.The various control screens became dark one after another , unti l finally , the main screen reflected the main reaction chamber ’ s halted status. Almost simulta neously , the countdown before W ang’ s eyes also stopped. The final number w as 1 174:10:07 . A few secon ds later , the numbers flickered and disappeared. As the world reemer ged, free of the ghostly numbers, W ang let out a long bre ath, as though he had just struggled up from underwater . He sat down, drained, and realized that others were still watching him. He t urned to the lab director . “System maintenance is the respo nsibility of th e E quipment Division. Why don’ t all of you in the research group take a break for a few days? I know everyone’ s been working hard.” “Chief W ang, you’re tired, too. Chief Engineer Zhang can take care of things here. Why don’ t you go home and rest as well?” “Y es, I am tired,” W ang said. After the lab d irector left, he picked up the phone and dial ed Shen Y ufei’ s number . She picked up after one ring. “Who or what is behind this?” W ang asked. He tried to make his voice calm, but failed. Silence. “What will happen at the end of the countdown?” More silence. “Are you listening?” “Y es.” “Why nanomate rials? This is not a particle accelerator . It’ s just applied research. Is it worth your attention?” “Whether something is worth the attention is not for us to decide.” “That’ s enough!” W ang shouted into the phone. The terror and desperation of the last few day s suddenly turned into uncontrollable rage. “Do you think these cheap tricks can fool me? Can stop technological progress? I admit that I can’ t, for now , explain how you’re doing it. But that’ s on ly because I haven’ t be en able to peek behind the curtain of your shameful illusionist.” “Y ou’re saying you want to see the countdown on an even greater scale?” Shen’ s question stunned W ang for a moment. He forced himself to be calm so he wouldn’ t fall into a trap. “Put away your set of tricks. So what ifyou show it at a bigger scale? I t’ s still only an illusion. Y ou can project a hologram into the sky , like wh at NA T O did during the last war . W ith a powerful enough laser you can project an image onto the surface of the moon! The shooter and the farm er should be able to manipulate matters at a scale that humans cannot. For example, can you make the countdown appear on the s urface of the sun?” W ang’ s mouth hung open. He had shocked himself with his own words. Unconsciously , he had named the two hypotheses that he ought to have avoided. He felt on the ver ge of falling into the same mental trap that had claimed the other victims. T rying to seize the initiative, he continued, “I can’ t anticipate all your tricks, but even with the sun, p erhaps your despicable illusion ist can still somehow make the deception seem real. T o give a demonstrati on that will really be convincing, you have to display it at an even lar ger scale.” “The question is whether you can take it,” Shen said. “W e’re friends. I want to help you avoid Y ang Dong’ s fate.” The men tion of Y ang’ s name made W ang shudder . But another sur ge of anger made him reckless. “W ill you take up my challenge?” “Of course.” “What are you going to do?” “Do you have a computer con nected to the Internet? Okay , enter the following W eb address: http://www .qsl.net/bg3tt/zl/mesdm.htm. Y ou got it open? Now , print it out and keep it with you.” W ang saw that the page was nothing more than a Morse code chart. “I don’ t understand. This” “During the next two days, please find a place where you can observe the cosm ic micr owave backgro und. For specifics, please check the e-mail I’ll send you.” “What … are you going to do?” “I know that yo ur nanomaterial project has been stopped. Do you plan on restarting it?” “Of course. Three days from now .” “Then the countdown will continue.” “At what scale will I see it?” A long silence followed. This woman, who was acting as the spokesperson for some force beyond human understanding, blocked every exit W ang had.“Three d ays from nowthat’ s the fourteenthbetween one an d five in the morning, the entire universe will flicker for you.”"
中国科幻基石丛书 36 4．三体、 周文王、 长夜 汪淼拨通了丁仪的电话，对方接听后，他才想起现在已是凌晨一点 多了。 “我是汪淼，真对不起，这么晚打扰。 ” “没关系，我正失眠。 ” “我……遇到一些事，想请你帮个忙。你知道国内有观测宇宙背景 辐射的机构吗？”汪淼产生了一种倾诉的欲望，但旋即觉得幽灵倒计时 之事目前还是不要让更多的人知道为好。 “宇宙背景辐射，你怎么对这个有雅兴？看来你真的遇到一些事了 ……你去看过杨冬的母亲吗？ ” “啊真对不起，我忘了。 ” “没关系。现在科学界，很多人都……像你说的那样遇到了一些 事，心不在焉的，不过你最好还是去看看她，她年纪大了，又不愿雇保 姆，要是有什么费力气的事麻烦你帮着干干……哦，宇宙背景辐射的 事， 你正好可以去找杨冬的母亲问问， 她退休前是搞天体物理专业的， 与国内的这类研究机构很熟。 ” “好好，我今天下班就去。 ” “那先谢谢了，我是真的无法再面对与杨冬有关的一切了。 ” 打完电话后，汪淼坐到电脑前，开始打印网页上显示的那张很简单 的莫尔斯电码对照表。这时他已经冷静下来，将思绪从倒计时上移开， 想着关于“科学边界”和申玉菲的事，想到她玩的网络游戏。关于申玉 地球往事 三体 37 菲，他能肯定的唯一一件事就是她不是爱玩游戏的人，这个说话如电报 般精简的女人给他唯一的印象就是冷，她的冷与其他的某些女性不同， 不是一张面具，而是从里到外冷透了。 汪淼总是下意识地将她与早已消失的 DOS 操作系统联系在一起， 一面空荡荡的黑屏幕，只有一个简单得不能再简单的“ C:>”提示符在 闪动，你输入什么它就输出什么。一个字都不会多，也不会有变化。现在 他知道， “ C:>”提示符后面其实是一个无底深渊。 她真会有兴致玩游戏，而且是戴着 V装具玩儿？她没有孩子，那套 V装具只能是自己买回去用的，这有些不可思议。 汪淼在浏览器的地址栏中输入那个很容易记住的游戏网址： www. threebody.com 。网页上显示该游戏只支持 V装具方式。汪淼想起了纳米 中心的职工娱乐室里好像有一套 V装具，就走出已经空荡荡的中心实 验大厅，去值班室要了钥匙，在娱乐室中穿过一排台球桌和健身器材， 在一台电脑旁找到了 V装具。费了很大劲才把感应服穿上，然后戴上显 示头盔，启动电脑。 启动游戏后，汪淼置身于一片黎明之际的荒原，荒原呈暗褐色，细 节看不清楚，远方地平线上有一小片白色的曙光，其余的天空则群星闪 烁。一声巨响，两座发着红光的山峰砸落在远方的大地上，整个荒原笼 罩在红色光芒之中。被激起的遮天蔽日的尘埃散去后，汪淼看清了那两 个顶天立地的大字：三体。 随后出现了一个注册界面，汪淼用“海人”这个 ID注册，然后成功 登录。 荒原依旧，但 V装具感应服中的压缩机咝咝地启动了，汪淼感到 一股逼人的寒气。前方出现了两个行走的人影，在曙光的背景前呈黑色 的剪影。汪淼追了上去，他看到两人都是男性，披着破烂的长袍，外面还 裹着一张肮脏的兽皮，都带着一把青铜时代那种又宽又短的剑，其中一 人背着一只有他一半高的细长的木箱子，那人扭头看看汪淼。他的脸像 中国科幻基石丛书 38 那兽皮一样脏和皱，双眼却很有神，眸子映着曙光。 “冷啊。 ”他说。 “是，真冷。 ”汪淼附和道。 “这是战国时代，我是周文王。 ”那人说。 “周文王不是战国时代的人吧？ ”汪淼问。 “他一直活到现在呢，纣王也活着。 ”另一个没背箱子的人说， “我 是周文王的追随者，我的 ID就叫‘周文王追随者’ ，他可是个天才。 ” “我的 ID是‘海人’ 。 ”汪淼说， “您背的是什么？ ” 周文王放下那只长方形木箱，将一个立面像一扇门似的打开，露出 里面的五层方格，借着晨曦的微光，汪淼看到每层之间都有高低不等的 一小堆细沙，每格中都有从上一格流下的一道涓细的沙流。 “沙漏，八小时漏完一次，颠倒三次就是一天。不过我常常忘了颠 倒，要靠追随者提醒。 ”周文王介绍说。 “你们好像是在长途旅行，有必要背这么笨重的计时器吗？ ” “那怎么计时呢？ ” “拿个小型的日晷多方便，或者干脆只看太阳也能知道大概的时 间。 ” 周文王和追随者面面相觑，然后一起盯着汪淼，好像他是个白痴， “太阳？看太阳怎么能知道时间？这可是乱纪元。 ” 汪淼正要询问这个怪异名词的含义，追随者哀鸣道： “真冷啊，冷 死我了！ ” 汪淼也觉得冷，但他不能随便脱下感应服，一般情况下，那样做会 被游戏注销 ID的。他说： “太阳出来就会暖和些的。 ” “你在冒充伟大的先知吗？连周文王都不算先知呢！ ”追随者冲汪 淼不屑地摇摇头。 “这需要先知吗？谁还看不出来太阳一两个小时后就会升起。 ”汪 淼指指天边说。 “这是乱纪元！ ”追随者说。 “什么是乱纪元？ ” 地球往事 三体 39 “除了恒纪元，都是乱纪元。 ”周文王说，像回答一个无知孩童的提 问。 果然，天边的晨光开始暗下去，很快消失了，夜幕重新笼罩了一切， 苍穹星光灿烂。 “原来现在是黄昏不是早晨？ ”汪淼问。 “是早晨，早晨太阳不一定能升起，这是乱纪元。 ” 寒冷使汪淼很难受， “看这样子，太阳要很长时间以后才会升出 来。”他哆嗦着指指模糊的地平线说。 “你怎么又会有这种想法？那可不一定，这是乱纪元。 ”追随者说着 转向周文王， “姬昌，给我些鱼干吃吧。 ” “不行！ ”周文王断然说道， “我也是勉强吃饱，要保证我能走到朝 歌，而不是你。 ” 说话间，汪淼注意到另一个方向的地平线又出现了曙光，他分不清 东南西北，但肯定不是上次出现时的方向。这曙光很快增强，不一会儿， 这个世界的太阳升起来了，是一颗蓝色的小太阳，很像增强了亮度的月 亮，但还是让汪淼感到了一丝温暖，并看清了大地的细节。但这个白昼 很短暂，太阳在地平线上方划了一道浅浅的弧形就落下了，夜色和寒冷 又笼罩了一切。 三人在一棵枯树前停下，周文王和追随者拔出青铜剑来砍柴，汪淼 将碎柴收集到一块，追随者拿出火镰，噼啪、噼啪打了好一阵，升起了一 堆火。汪淼的感应服的前胸部分变暖和了，但背后仍然冰冷。 “烧些脱水者，火才旺呢。 ”追随者说。 “住嘴！那是纣王干的事！ ” “反正路上那些散落的，都破成那样，泡不活了。如果你的理论真 能行，别说烧一些，吃一些都成，与那理论相比，几条命算什么？ ” “胡说！我们是学者！ ” 篝火燃尽后，三人继续赶路。由于他们之间交谈很少，系统加快了 游戏时间的流逝速度，周文王很快将背上的沙漏翻了六下，转眼间两天 中国科幻基石丛书 40 过去了，太阳还没有升起过一次，甚至天边连曙光的影子都没有。 “看来太阳不会出来了。 ”汪淼说，同时调出游戏界面来看了一下 自己的 HP，它正因寒冷而迅速减小。 “你又冒充伟大的先知了……”追随者说，汪淼和他一起说出了后 半句， “这是乱纪元！ ” 这话说完不久，天边真的出现了曙光，并且迅速增强，转眼间太阳 就升了起来，汪淼发现这次升起的是一颗大太阳，当它升至一半时，直 径占了视野内至少五分之一的地平线。暖流扑面而来，令汪淼心旷神 怡，但他看周文王和追随者时，发现他们都一脸惊恐，仿佛魔鬼降临。 “快，找阴凉地儿！ ”追随者大喊，汪淼跟着他们飞奔，跑到了一处 低矮的岩石后面蹲下来。岩石的阴影在渐渐缩短，周围的大地像处于白 炽状态般刺眼，脚下的冻土迅速融化，由坚硬如铁变成泥泞一片，热浪 滚滚，汪淼很快出汗了。当大太阳升到头顶正上方时，三人用兽皮蒙住 头，强光仍如利箭般从所有缝隙和孔洞中射进来。三人绕着岩石挪到另 一边，躲进那边刚刚出现的阴影中…… 太阳落山后，空气依然异常闷热，大汗淋漓的三人坐在岩石上，追 随者沮丧地说： “乱纪元旅行，真是在地狱里走路，我受不了了；再说我 也没吃的了，你不分我些鱼干，又不让吃脱水者，唉 ” “那你只能脱水了。 ”周文王说，一手用兽皮扇着风。 “脱水以后，你不会扔下我吧？ ” “当然不会，我保证把你带到朝歌。 ” 追随者脱下了被汗水浸湿的长袍，赤身躺到泥地上，在落日的余晖 中，汪淼看到追随者身上的汗水突然增加了。他很快知道那不是出汗， 这人身体内的水分正在被彻底排出，这些水在沙地上形成了几条小小 的溪流，追随者的整个躯体如一根熔化的蜡烛在变软变薄……十分钟 后水排完了，那躯体化为一张人形的软皮一动不动地躺在泥地上，面部 的五官都模糊不清了。 “他死了呜？”汪淼问。他想起来了，一路上不时看到有这样的人形 地球往事 三体 41 软皮，有的已破损不全，那就是不久前追随者想要用来烧火的脱水者。 “没有。 ”周文王说着，将追随者变成的软皮拎起来，拍了拍上面的 土，放到岩石上将他（它）卷起来，就像卷一只放了气的皮球一般， “在 水里泡一会儿，他就会恢复原状活过来，就像泡干蘑菇那样。 ” “他的骨骼也变软了？” “是的，都成了干纤维，这样便于携带。 ” “这个世界中的每个人都能脱水吗？ ” “当然，你也能，要不，在乱纪元是活不下去的。 ”周文王将卷好的 追随者递给汪淼， “你带着他吧，扔到路上不是被人烧了，就是吃了。 ” 汪淼接过软皮，很轻的一小卷。用胳膊夹着倒也没有什么异样的感 觉。 汪淼夹着脱水的追随者，周文王背着沙漏，两人继续着艰难的旅 程。同前几天一样，这个世界中的太阳运行得完全没有规律，在连续几 个严寒的长夜后，可能会突然出现一个酷热的白天，或者相反。两人相 依为命，在篝火边抵御严寒，泡在湖水中度过酷热。好在游戏时间可以 加快。一个月可以在半小时内过完，这使得乱纪元的旅程还是可以忍受 的。 这天，漫漫长夜已延续了近一个星期（按沙漏计时） ，周文王突然 指着夜空欢呼起来： “飞星！飞星！两颗飞星！ ！ ” 其实，汪淼之前就注意到那种奇怪的天体，它比星星大，能显出乒 乓球大小的圆盘形状，运行速度很快，肉眼能明显地看到它在星空中移 动，只是这次出现了两个。 周文王解释说： “两颗飞星出现，恒纪元就要开始了！ ” “以前看到过的。 ” “那只有一个。 ” “最多只有两个吗？ ” “不，有时会有三个，但不会再多了。 ” 中国科幻基石丛书 42 “三颗飞星出现，是不是预示着更美好的纪元？ ” 周文王用充满恐惧的眼神瞪了汪淼一眼， “你在说什么呀，三颗飞 星……祈祷它不要出现吧。 ” 周文王的话没错，他们向往的恒纪元很快开始了，太阳升起落下开 始变得有规律，一个昼夜渐渐固定在十八小时左右，日夜有规律的交替 使天气变得暖和了一些。 “恒纪元能持续多长时间？ ”汪淼问。 “一天或一个世纪，每次多长谁都说不准。 ”周文王坐在沙漏上，仰 头看着正午的太阳。 “据记载，西周曾有过长达两个世纪的恒纪元，唉， 生在那个时代的人有福啊。 ” “那乱纪元会持续多长时间呢？ ” “不是说过嘛，除了恒纪元都是乱纪元，两者互为对方的间隙。 ” “那就是说，这是一个全无规律的混乱世界？ ！ ” “是的，文明只能在较长的气候温暖的恒纪元里发展。大部分时间 里，人类集体脱水存贮起来，当较长的恒纪元到来时，再集体浸泡复活， 生产和建设。 ” “那怎样预知每个恒纪元到来的时间和长短呢？” “做不到，从来没有做到过，当恒纪元到来时，国家是否浸泡取决 于大王的直觉，常常是：浸泡复活了，庄稼种下了，城镇开始修筑，生活 刚刚开始，恒纪元就结束了。严寒和酷热就毁灭了一切。 ”周文王说到 这里，一手指向汪淼，双眼变得炯炯有神， “好了，你已经知道了这个游 戏的目标：就是运用我们的智力和悟性，分析研究各种现象，掌握太阳 运行的规律，文明的生存就维系于此。 ” “在我看来太阳运行根本就没有规律。 ” “那是因为你没能悟出世界的本原。 ” “你悟出来了？” “是的，这就是我去朝歌的目的，我将为纣王献上一份精确的万年 历。 ” 地球往事 三体 43 “可这一路上，没看到你有这种能力。 ” “对太阳运行规律的预测只能在朝歌做出，因为那里是阴阳的交 汇点，只有在那里取的卦才是准确的。 ”两人又在严酷的乱纪元跋涉了 很长时间，其间又经历了一次短暂的恒纪元，终于到达了朝歌。 汪淼听到一种不间断的类似于雷声的轰鸣，这声音是朝歌大地上 许多奇怪的东西发出的，那是一座座巨大的单摆，每座都有几十米高。 单摆的摆锤是一块块巨石，被一大束绳索吊在架于两座细高石塔间的 天桥上。每座单摆都在摇动中。驱动它们的是一群群身穿盔甲的士兵， 他们合着奇怪的号子，齐力拉动系在巨石摆锤上的悬索，维持着它的摆 动。汪淼发现，所有巨摆的摆动都是同步的，远远看去，这景象怪异得使 人着迷，像大地上竖立着一座座走动的钟表，又像从天而降的许多巨 大、抽象的符号。 在巨摆的环绕下，有一座巨大的金字塔，夜幕中如同一座高耸的黑 山，这就是纣王的宫殿。汪淼跟着周文王走进了金字塔基座上的一个不 高的洞门，门旁几名守卫的士兵在黑暗中如幽灵般无声地徘徊。他们沿 着一条长长的隧道向里走，隧道窄而黑，间隔很远才有一枝火炬。 “在乱纪元，整个国家在脱水中，但纣王一直醒着，陪伴着这片没 有生机的国土。要想在乱纪元生存，就得居住在这种墙壁极厚的建筑 中，几乎像住在地下，才能避开严寒和酷热。 ”周文王边走边对汪淼解 释。 走了很长的路，才进入了纣王位于金字塔中心的大殿，其实这里并 不大，很像一个山洞。身披一大张花兽皮坐在一处高台上的人显然是纣 王了，但首先吸引汪淼目光的是一位黑衣人，他的黑衣几乎与大殿中浓 重的阴影融为一体，那张苍白的脸仿佛是浮在虚空中。 “这是伏羲。 ”纣王对刚进来的周文王和汪淼介绍那位黑衣人，仿 佛他们一直就在那儿似的，而黑衣人才是新来的， “他认为，太阳是脾 气乖戾的大神，他醒着的时候喜怒无常，是乱纪元；睡着时呼吸均匀，是 恒纪元，伏羲建议竖起了外面的那些大摆，日夜不停地摆动，声称这对 中国科幻基石丛书 44 太阳神有强烈的催眠作用，能使其陷入漫长的昏睡。但直到现在，我们 看到太阳神仍醒着，最多只是不时打打盹儿。 ” 纣王挥了一下手，有人端来一个陶罐，放到伏羲面前的小石台 上汪淼后来知道，那是一罐调味料。伏羲长叹一声，端起陶罐喝下 去，那咕咚咕咚的声音仿佛黑暗深处有一颗硕大的心脏在跳动。喝了一 半后，他将剩下的调味料倒在身上，然后扔下陶罐，走向大殿角落的一 口架在火上的青铜大鼎，爬上鼎沿；他跳进大鼎，激起了一大团蒸气。 “姬昌坐下，一会儿就开宴。 ”纣王指指那口大鼎说。 “愚蠢的巫术。 ”周文王朝大鼎偏了下头，轻蔑地说。 “你对太阳悟出了什么？”纣王问，火光在他的双眸中跳动。 “太阳不是大神，太阳是阳，黑夜是阴，世界是在阴阳平衡中运转 的，这不在我们的控制之中，但可以预测。 ”周文王说着，抽出青铜剑， 在火炬照到的地板上画出了一对大大的阴阳鱼，然后以令人目眩的速 度在周围画出了六十四卦，看上去如同火光中时隐时现的大年轮， “大 王，这就是宇宙的密码，借助它，我将为您的王朝献上一部精确的万年 历。 ” “姬昌啊，我现在急需知道的，是下一个长恒纪元什么时候到来。 ” “我将立刻为您占卜。 ”周文王说着，走到阴阳鱼中央盘腿坐下，抬 头望着大殿的顶部，目光仿佛穿透了厚厚的金字塔看到了星空，他的双 手手指同时在进行着复杂的运动，组合成一部高速运转的计算器。寂静 中，只有大鼎中的汤发出咕嘟咕嘟的声响，仿佛煮在汤中的巫师在梦 呓。 周文王从阴阳图中站起来，头仍仰着，说： “下面将是一段为期四 十一天的乱纪元，然后将出现为期五天的恒纪元，接下来是为期二十三 天的乱纪元和为期十八天的恒纪元，然后是为期八天的乱纪元，当这段 乱纪元结束后，大王，您所期待的长恒纪元就到来了，这个恒纪元将持 续三年零九个月，其间气候温暖，是一个黄金纪元。 ” “我们首先需要证实一下你前面的预测。 ”纣王不动声色地说。 地球往事 三体 45 汪淼听到上方传来一阵轰隆隆的声音，大殿顶上的一块石板滑开， 露出一处正方形的洞口，汪淼调整方向，看到这个方洞通到金字塔的外 面，在这个方洞的尽头，汪淼看到了几颗闪烁的星星。 游戏的时间加快了，由两名士兵看守的周文王带来的沙漏几秒钟 就翻动一次，标志着八小时的流逝，上方的窗口无规律地闪烁起来，不 时有一束乱纪元的阳光射进大殿，有时很微弱，如月光一般；有时则十 分强烈，投在地上的方形光斑白炽明亮，使所有的火炬黯然失色。汪淼 数着沙漏翻动的次教，当翻到一百二十次左右时，阳光投进窗口的间隔 变得规则了，预测中的第一个恒纪元到来。沙漏再翻动十五下后，窗口 的闪烁又紊乱起来，乱纪元又开始了。然后又是恒纪元，然后又是乱纪 元，它们的开始和持续时间虽然有些小误差，但与周文王的预测已是相 当的吻合了。当最后一段为期八天的乱纪元结束后，他预言的长恒纪元 开始了。汪淼数着沙漏的翻动，二十天过去了，射进大殿的日光仍遵循 着精确的节奏。这时，游戏时间的流逝被调整到正常。 纣王向周文王点点头： “姬昌啊，我将为你竖起一座丰碑，比这座 宫殿还要高大。 ” 周文王深鞠一躬： “我的大王，让您的王朝苏醒吧，繁荣吧！ ” 纣王在石台上站起身，张开双臂，仿佛要拥抱整个世界，他用一种 很奇怪的歌唱般的音调喊道： “浸泡……” 听到这号令，大殿内的人都跑向洞门。在周文王的示意下，汪淼跟 着他沿着长长的隧道向金字塔外走去。走出洞门，汪淼看到时值正午， 太阳在当空静静地照耀着大地，微风吹过，他似乎嗅到了春天的气息。 周文王和汪淼一同来到了距金字塔不远的一处湖畔，湖面上的冰已融化 了，阳光在微波间跳动。 先出来的一队士兵高呼着： “浸泡！浸泡！ ”都奔向湖边一处形似谷 仓的高大石砌建筑。在来的路上。汪淼不时在远处看到过这种建筑，周 文王告诉他那是“干仓” ，是存贮脱水人的大型仓库。士兵们打开干仓 的石门，从中搬出一卷卷落满灰尘的皮卷，他们每人都抱着、夹着好几 中国科幻基石丛书 46 个皮卷，走向湖边，将那些皮卷扔进湖中。那些皮卷一遇到水，立刻舒展 开来，一时间，湖面上漂浮着一片似乎是剪出来的薄薄的人影。每一张 “人片”都在迅速吸水膨胀，渐渐地，湖面上的“人片”都变成了圆润的 肉体，这些肉体很快具有了生命的迹象，一个个挣扎着从齐腰深的湖水 中站立起来。他们睁大如梦初醒的眼睛看着这风和日丽的世界。 “浸 泡！”一个人高呼起来，立刻引来了一片欢呼声： “浸泡！浸泡！ ！”…… 这些人从湖中跑上岸，赤身裸体地奔向干仓，将更多的皮卷投入湖中， 浸泡复活的人一群群从湖中跑出来，这一幕也发生在更远处的湖泊和 池溏中，整个世界在复活。 “噢，天啊！我的指头 ” 汪淼顺着声音看去，见一个刚浸泡复活的人站在湖中，举着一只手 哭喊道，那手缺了中指，血从手上断指处滴到湖中，其他复活者纷纷拥 过他的身边，兴高采烈地奔向湖岸，没有人注意他。 “行了。你就知足吧！ ”一个经过的复活者说， “有人整条胳膊腿都 没了，有人脑袋被咬了个洞，如果再不浸泡，我们怕是都要被乱纪元的 老鼠啃光了！ ” “我们脱水多长时间了？”另一位复活者问。 “看看大王宫殿上积的沙尘有多厚就知道了，刚听说现在的大王 已不是脱水前的大王了，不知是他的儿子还是孙子。 ” 浸泡持续了八天才完全结束，这时所有的脱水人都已复活，世界又 一次获得了新生。这八天中，人们享受着每天二十个小时、周期准确的 日出日落。沐浴在春天的气息里，所有人都衷心地赞美太阳、赞美掌管 宇宙的诸神。第八天夜里，大地上的篝火比天上的星星都密，在漫长的 乱纪元中荒废的城镇又充满了灯火和喧闹，同文明以前的无数次浸泡 一样，所有人将彻夜狂欢，迎接日出后的新生活。 但太阳再也没有升起来。 各种计时器都表明日出的时间已过，但各个方向的地平线都仍是 漆黑一片。又过了十个小时，没有太阳的影子，连最微弱的晨光都见不 地球往事 三体 47 到。一天过去了，无边的夜在继续着；两天过去了，寒冷像一只巨掌在暗 夜中压向大地。 “请大王相信我，这只是暂时的，我看到了宇宙中的阳在聚集，太 阳就要升起来了，恒纪元和春天将继续！ ”金字塔的大殿里，周文王跪 在纣王端坐的石台下哀求道。 “还是把鼎烧上吧。 ”纣王叹了口气说。 “大王！大王！ ”一名大臣从洞门里跌跌撞撞地跑进来，带着哭腔喊 道， “天上，天上有三颗飞星！ ！ ” 大殿中的所有人都惊呆了，空气仿佛凝固了，只有纣王仍然不动声 色。他转向以前一直不屑于搭理的汪淼， “你还不知道出现三颗飞星意 味着什么吧？姬昌啊，告诉他。 ” “这意味着漫长的严寒岁月，冷得能把石头冻成粉末。 ”周文王长 叹一声，说。 “脱水 ”纣王又用那歌唱般的声音喊道。其实，在外面的大地 上，人们早已开始陆续脱水，重新变成人干以度过漫漫长夜，他们中的 幸运者被重新搬入干仓，还有大量的人干被丢弃在旷野上。周文王慢慢 站起身，朝架在火上的青铜大鼎走去，他爬上鼎沿，跳进去前停了几秒 钟，也许是看到伏羲煮得烂熟的脸正在汤中冲他轻笑。 “用文火。 ”纣王无力地说，然后转向其他人， “该 EXIT的就 EXIT吧，游戏到这儿已经没什么玩头了。 ” 洞门上方出现了发着红光的 EXIT标志，人们纷纷向那里走去，汪 淼也跟随而去，穿过洞门和长长的隧道来到了金字塔外，看到黑夜里大 雪纷飞，刺骨的寒风使他打了个冷颤。天空的一角显示出游戏的时间又 加快了。 十天后，雪仍在下着，但雪片大而厚重，像是凝结的黑暗。有人在汪 淼耳边低声说： “这是在下二氧化碳干冰了。 ”汪淼扭头一看，是周文王 的追随者。 又过了十天，雪还在下，但雪花已变得薄而透明，在金字塔洞门透 中国科幻基石丛书 48 出的火炬的微光中呈现出一种超脱的淡蓝色，像无数飞舞的云母片。 “这雪花已经是凝固的氧、氮了，大气正在绝对零度中消失。 ” 金字塔被雪埋了起来，最下层是水的雪，中层是干冰的，上层是 固态氧、氮的雪。夜空变得异常晴朗，群星像一片银色的火焰。一行字在 星空的背景上出现： 这一夜持续了四十八年，第 137号文明在严寒中毁灭了，该文明 进化至战国层次。 文明的种子仍在，它将重新启动，再次开始在三体世界中命运莫测 的进化，欢迎您再次登录。 退出前，汪淼最后注意到的是夜空中的三颗飞星，它们相距很近， 相互围绕着，在太空深渊中跳着某种诡异的舞蹈。,"7 T h r e e B o d y : K i n g W e n o f Z h o u a n d t h e L o n g N i g h t W ang dialed Ding Y i’ s number . Only when Ding picked up did he realize that it was already one in the morning. “This is W ang Miao. I’m sorry to be calling so late.” “No problem. I can’ t sleep anyway .” “I have … seen something, and I’d like your help. Do you know if there are any facilities in China th at are observing the cosmic microwave background?” W ang had the ur g e to talk to someone about what was going on, but he thought it best to not let too many people know about the countdown that only he could see. “The cosmic microwave background? What made you interested in that? I guess you really have run into some problems.… Have you been to see Y ang Dong’ s mother yet?” “AhI’m sorry . I for got.” “No worries. Right now , many scientists have … seen something, like you. Everyone’ s distracted. But I think it’ s still best if you go visit her . She’ s getting on in years, and she won’ t hire a caretaker . If there’ s some task around the home that she needs help with, please help her .… Oh, right, the cosmic microwave background. Y ou can ask Y ang’ s mother . Before she retired, she was an astrophysicis t. She’ s very familiar with such facilities in China.” “Good! I’ll go after work today .”“Then I’ll thank you in advance. I really can’ t face anything that reminds me of Y ang Dong again.” * * * After ha nging up, W ang sat in front of his computer and printed out the simple Morse code chart. By now he was calm enough to turn his thoughts away fr om the countdown. He pondered the Frontiers of Science, Shen Y ufei, and the computer game she had been playing. The only thing he knew fo r certain about Shen was that she wasn’ t the type to enjoy computer games. S he spoke like a telegrap h and gave him the impression that she was always e xtremely cold. It wasn’ t the kind of coldness that some people put on like a maskhers suf fused her all the way through. W ang subconsciously thought of her as the long-obsolete DOS operating system: a blank, black screen, a bare “C:\ > ” promp t, a blinking cursor . Whateve r you entered, it echoed back. Not one extra letter and not a single change. But now he kne w that behind the “C:\ > ” was a bottomless abyss. She’ s actually inter ested in a game? A game that r equir es a V -suit? She has no kids, whi ch means she bo ught the V -suit for herself. The very idea is pr eposter ous. W ang en tered th e address for t he game into the browser . It had been easy to memori ze: www .3body . net. The site indicated that the game only supported access via V -suit. W ang remembered that the employee lounge at the N anotechno logy Research Center had a V -suit. He left the now-empty main lab and w ent to the secur ity of fice to get the key . In the lounge, he passed t he pool tables and the e xercise machines and found the V -suit next to a computer . He struggled into the haptic feedback suit, put on the panoramic viewing helmet, and turned on the computer . After en tering th e game, W ang f ound himself in the middle of a desolate plain at dawn. The plain was d un-colored, blurry , its details hard to make out. In the distance, there was a sliver of white light on the horizon. T winkling stars covered the rest of the sky . There w as a loud explosion, and two red-glowing mountains crashed against the earth in the distance. The whole plain was bathed in red light.When th e dust finally cleared from the sky , W ang saw two giant words erected between the sky and the earth: THREE BODY . Next came a re gistration screen. W ang created the ID “Hairen,” and logged in.15 * * * The plai n remain ed desolate, but now the compressors in the V -suit whirred to life, and W ang could feel gusts of cold air against his body . Before him appeared two walking figures, forming dark silhouettes again st the dawn light. W ang ran after them. He saw that both figures were male. They were dressed in lon g robes full of holes, covered by dirty animal hides. Each carried a short, wide bronze sword. One of them carried a narrow wooden trunk that was as long as half his heigh t. He turned aro und to look at W ang. The man’ s face was as dirty and wrinkled as the hide h e wore, but his eyes were sharp and lively , the pupils glinting in the early-morning glow . “It’ s cold,” he said. “Y es, very cold.” “This is the W arring States Period,” the man with the trunk on his back said. “I am King W en of Zhou.” “I d on’ t think K ing W en belongs to the W arring States Period ,” W ang said.16 “He’ s survived until now ,” the other man said. “King Zhou of Shang is alive, too. I am a follower of King W en. Indeed, that’ s my log-in ID: ‘Follower of King W en of Zhou.’ He’ s a genius, you know?”17 “My log-in ID is ‘Hairen.’ What are you carrying on your back?” King W e n put down the rectangular trunk and stood it up vertic ally . He opened o ne of the sides like a door and revealed five compartments within. By the faint ligh t, W ang could see that every layer held a small mound of sand. Every compartment seem ed to have sand falling into it from the compartment above, through a small hole. “A type of sandg lass. Every eight hours all the sand flows to the bottom. Flip it three times and you can measure a day . But often I for get to flip it, and I need Follower here to remind me.”“Y ou se em to be on a very long journey . Is it necessary to carry such a bulky clock?” “How else would we measure time?” “A p ortable sundial would be m uch more convenient. Or else yo u could just look at the sun and know the approximate time.” King W en and F ollower stared at each other , and then turned as one to gaze at W ang, as though he was an idiot. “The sun? How can the sun tell us the time? W e’re in the midst of a Chaotic Era.” W ang was about to ask for th e meaning of the strange ter m when Follower cried out piteously , “It’ s so cold! I’m going to die of the cold!” W ang felt very cold as well. B ut in most games, taking of f his V -suit would immediately cause his ID to be deleted by the system. He couldn’ t do that. He said, “When the sun comes out it will be warmer .” “Are yo u preten ding to be some kind of oracle? Even King W en cannot predict the future.” Follower shook his head contemptuously . “What d oes wha t I said have to do with predicting the future? E veryone can see that the sun will rise in about another hour or two.” W an g pointed to the sliver of light above the horizon. “This is a Chaotic Era!” “What is a Chaotic Era?” “Other than Stable Eras, all times are Chaotic Eras.” King W en answered the way he would have spoken to an ignorant child. Indeed, the light over the horizo n dimmed and soon disappeared. Night covered everything. The stars overhead shone even more brightly . “So that was dusk instead of dawn?” W ang asked. “It is morning. But the sun doesn’ t always rise in the morning. That’ s what a Chaotic Era is like.” W ang fo und the cold hard to take. “It looks like the sun won’ t rise for a long time.” He shivered and pointed to the blurry horizon. “What m akes yo u think that? There’ s no way to be certain. I told you, this is a Chaotic Era.” Follower turned to King W en. “May I have some dried fish?” “Absolutely not.” King W en’ s tone brooked no disagreement. “I barely have enough for myself. W e must guarantee that I mak e it to Zhao Ge, not you.”18As they spoke, W ang noticed the sky brightening over anothe r part of the horiz on. He couldn’ t be sure of the compass directions, but he was sure the d irection this time was dif ferent from last time. The sky gr ew brighter , and soon, the sun of this world rose. It was small and bluish in color , like a very bri ght moo n. W ang still felt a bit of warmth, and could now see the landscape aroun d him more cle arly . But the day didn’ t last long. The sun traversed a shallow arc over the horizon and soon set. Night and the bone- chilling cold once more settled over everything. The three travelers stopped in front of a dead tree. King W en and Follower took out their bronze swords to chop the tree into fir ewood, and W ang gathered the firewood int o a pile. Follower took out a p iece of flint and stru ck it against a blade unt il the sparks caught. The fire soon warmed the front of W ang’ s V -suit, but his back remained cold. “W e should burn some of the de hydrated bodies,” Follower said . “Then we’ll have a roaring fire!” “Put tha t though t out of your mind. Only the tyrant King Zhou would engage in that kind of behavior .” “W e’ve seen so many dehydrated bodies scattered along the road here. They’ve been torn, and won’ t b e revivable even when rehydrated. If your theory really works, what does it matter if we burn a few of the m? W e can even eat some. How can a few lives compare to the importance of your theory?” “Stop with that nonsense! W e’re scholars!” After the fire b urnt out, the three continued their journey . Sin ce they were not speaking to each other much, the system sped up the passage of in- game time. King W en flipped the sandglass on his back six times rapidly , indicating the lapse of two days. The sun never rose once, not even a hint of dawn over the horizon. “It seem s that the sun will never rise again,” W ang said. He bro ught up the game menu to take a look at his health bar . Due to the extreme cold, it was steadily decreasing. “Again, you’re pretending you’re some kind of oracle,” Follower said. But this time he and W ang finis hed the thought together . “This is a Chaotic Era!” Soon af ter this, however , dawn did appear over the horizon. The sky brightened rapid ly , and the sun rose. W ang noticed that this time, the sunwas gigantic. After just half of it rose, it took up at least one-fifth of the visible horizon. W aves of heat bathed them, and W ang felt refreshed. But when he glanced over at King W en and Follower , he saw that both had terror on their faces as though they had seen a demon. “Quick! Find shade!” Followe r shouted. W ang ran after them. They ducked behind a lar ge rock. The shadow cast by the rock gradually grew shorter a nd shor ter . The earth a round them glowed as though on fire. The permafrost bene ath them soon melted, the steel-like hard surf ace turning into a sea of mud, roiled by waves of heat. W ang sweated profusely . When th e sun was directly overhead, the three covered their heads with the anim al hides, but the bright light still shot through the holes and gaps like arrows. The three shifted a round the rock until they were able to hide inside the new shadow that had just appeared on the other side. After the sun s et, the air rema ined hot and damp. The three sweat- drenched travele rs sat on the rock. Follower spoke with dismay . “T raveling during a Chaotic Era is like wal king through hell. I can’ t stand it anymore. Also, I haven’ t had anything to eat because you won’ t give me any dried fish and you won’ t let me eat the dehydrated bodies. What” “The on ly choice is to dehydrate you,” King W en said, fanning himself with a piece of hide. “Y ou won’ t abandon me afterwards, will you?” “Of course not. I promise to bring you to Zhao Ge.” Follower strippe d of f his sweat- soaked robe and lay down nud e on the muddy earth. In the last glow from the sun, already below t he horizon, W ang sa w water oozing out of Follower ’ s body . He knew tha t it was no longer s weat. Al l the water in his body was being dischar ged and squeezed out. The water coalesced into a few small rivulets in the mud. His body turned soft and lost its shape like a melting candle. T en min utes later , all the wate r had been eliminated from his body . Follower was now a man-shap ed piece of leather stretched out on the ground. His facial features had flattened and become indistinct. “Is he dead?” W ang asked. He remembered seeing such man -shaped pieces of hide scattered along the road. Some were torn and incomplete. He supposed they were the dehyd rated bodies Follower spoke of earlier as potential kindling.“No,” K ing W en answered. He picked up Follower ’ s skin, brushed the mud and dust of f, laid him out on the rock, and rolled him up like a balloon with its air let out. “He’ll recover soon enough, when we soak him in water . It’ s just like soaking dried mushrooms.” “Even his bones have turned soft?” “Y es. Hi s skelet on has turned in to dried fibers. This makes him easy to carry .” “In this world, can everyone be dehydrated and rehydrated?” “Of course. Y ou can, too. Otherwise we could not survive the Chaotic Eras.” King W en handed the ro lled-up Follower to W ang. “Carry him. If you abandon him on the road, he’ll be burned or eaten.” W ang ac cepted the skin, a light roll. He held it under his arm, and it didn’ t feel too strange. W ith W ang carrying the dehydrated Follower and King W en carrying the sandglass, the two continue d their arduous journey . Like t he previous few days, the progress of the sun in this world followed no pattern. After a long, fri gid nigh t lasting several days’ worth of time, a brief bu t scorching day might follow , and vice versa. The two relied on each other for survival. They lit fires to hold of f the cold, and ducked into lakes to avoid the heat. At least the game sped up the progress of time. A month in game time might pass in half an hour . This made the journey through the Chaotic Era at least tolerable for W ang. One day , after a long night that lasted almost a week (as meas ured by the s andglass), King W en suddenly shouted joyously as he po inted to the night sky . “Flying stars! T wo flying stars!” Actually , W ang had already no ticed the strange celestial bodies. They were bigger than stars, and showed up as disks about the size of ping-pong balls. Th ey moved through the s ky at a pace quick enough for th e naked eye to detec t the motion. But it wa s the first time two of them ha d appeared together . King W e n expla ined, “When two flying stars appear , it means a Stable Era is about to begin.” “W e’ve seen flying stars before.” “Y es, but only one at a time.” “Is two the most we’ll see at once?”“No. Sometimes three will appear , but no more than that.” “If three flying stars appear , does that herald an even better era?” King W en gave W ang a frightened look. “What are you talking about? Three flying stars … pray that such a thing never happens.” King W en turned out to be right. The yearned-for Stable Era soon began. S unrise and sunset began to follow a pattern. A day-night cycle began to stabiliz e around eighteen hours. The orderly alternation of day and night made the weather warm and mild. “How long does a Stable Era last?” W ang asked. “As short as a day or as long as a century . No one can predict how long one will last.” K ing W en sat on the sandglass, lifting his head to gaze at the noonday sun. “According to historical records, the W estern Zhou Dynasty experienced a Stable Era lasting two centuries. How lucky to be born during such a time!” “Then how long does a Chaotic Era last?” “I already told you. Other than Stable Eras, all other times belong to Chaotic Eras. Each of them takes up the time not occupied by the other .” “So, this is a world in which there are no patterns?” “Y es. Civilizatio n can only dev elop in the mild climate of Stable Eras. Most of the time, humankind must collectively dehydrate and be stored. When a long Stable Era arrives, they collectively revive through rehydration. Then they proceed to build and produce.” “How can you predict the arrival and duration of each Stable Era?” “Such a thing ha s never been done. When a Stable Era arrives, the king makes a decision based on intuition as to whether to engage in mass rehydration. Often, the people are revived, crops are planted, cities begin construction, lif e has just startedand then the Stable Era en ds. Extreme cold and heat then destroy everything.” King W en now pointed at W ang, his eyes spa rkling. “Now you know the goal of this game: to use our intellect and und erstanding to analyze all phenomena until we can know the pattern of the sun’ s movement. The survival of civilization depends on it.” “Based on my observations, there is no pattern to the sun’ s movement at all.” “That’ s because you do not understand the fundamental nature of the world.” “And you do?”“Y es. Th is is why I’m going to Zhao Ge. I will present King Zhou with an accurate calendar .” “But I’ve seen no evidence on this trip that you can do such a thing.” “Predicting the sun’ s motion is only possible in Zhao Ge, for that is where yin and yang meet. Only the lots cast there are accurate.” The two continued on through the harsh conditions of another Chaotic Era, inte rrupted briefly by a sh ort Stable Era, until they finall y arrived in Zhao Ge. W ang heard an u nceasing roar that sounded like thunder . The sound was generated by the numerous gia nt pendulums that could be seen all over Zhao Ge, each te ns of meters in height. The weight of each pend ulum was a giant rock, suspended from a thick rope tied to a bridge th at stretched between the tops of two slender stone towers. All the pendulu ms were swinging as groups of soldiers in armor kept them in motion. Chanting incomprehensibly , they rhythmically pulled ropes attached to the g iant stone weights, adding to the pendulums’ arcs as they slowed. W ang noticed that all the pendulums swung in step. From far away , the sigh t was awe-inducing: It was as though numerous giant clocks had been erected over the earth, or colossal, abstract symbols had fallen from the sky . The giant pendulums surrounded an even more enormous pyramid, standing like a tall mountain in the dark night. This was K ing Zhou’ s palace. W ang followed King W en into a low door at the base of the pyramid, before which a few soldiers patrolled in the darkness, noiseless as ghosts. The door led to a long, narrow , dark tunnel going de ep into the pyramid, with a few torches along the way . As they walked, King W en spoke to W ang. “During a Chaotic Era, the entire co untry is dehydrated. But King Zhou remains awake, a companion to the lifeless la nd. In order to survive during a Chaotic Era, on e must live in t hick-walled buildings like this one, as though one w ere living under ground. It’ s the only way to avoid the extreme heat and cold.” After a long time in the tunnel, they finally arrived at the Grea t Hall at the cente r of the pyramid. Actu ally , the hall was not that big and reminded W ang of a cave. The man sittin g on a dais and draped with a particolored hide was undoubtedly King Zh ou. But what drew W ang’ s atte ntion was aman dressed all in black. The black robe blended with the thick shadows in the Great Hall, and the pale white face seemed to float in air . “This is Fu Xi.”19 King Zhou introduced the man in black to W ang and King W en. He spoke as though W ang and King W en had always been there, while the man in black was the newcomer . “He thinks that the sun is a temperamental god. When the god is awake, his moods are unpredictable, and thus we have a Chaotic Era. But when he’ s asleep, his brea thing evens out, and thus we have a Stable Era. Fu Xi suggested that I build those pendulums you see out there and keep them in constant motion. He claims that the pendulu ms can have a hypnotic ef fect on the sun god and cause him to sink into a long slumber . But we can all see that so far , the sun god remains awake, though from time to time he seems to nap briefly .” King Zh ou wav ed his hands, an d servants brought over a clay pot and set it down on the small stone table before Fu Xi. Later , W ang found out that it was a pot of seasoned broth. Fu Xi sighed, lifted the pot, and drank in great gulps, the sound of his sw allows echoing like the beating of a giant heart in the dar kness. After he was halfway done with the c ontents, he poured the rest over his body . Then he threw down the pot and walked toward a lar ge bronze cauldron suspended over a fire in the corner of the Great Hall. He climbed onto the edge of the cauldron and jumped in, stirring up a cloud of vapor . “Ji Chang, sit down,”20 Kin g Zhou said . “W e’ll eat in just a little while.” He pointed to the cauldron. “Foolish witchcraft,” King W en said, glancing contemptuously at the cauldron. “What have you learned about the sun?” King Zhou asked. Firelight flickered in his eyes. “The sun is not a god. The sun is yang, and the night is yin. The world proceeds on the balance betwee n yin and yang. Though we cannot control the p rocess, we can predict it.” King W en took out his bronze sword and drew a yin-yang symbol on the floor , dimly lit by the fire. Then , he carved the sixty-four hexagrams of th e I Ching a round the symbol, the whol e composition res embling a calendar wheel. “My king, this is the code of the universe. W ith it, I can present your dynasty with an accurate calendar .” “Ji Chang, I need to know when the next long Stable Era will come.”“I will forecast it for you right n ow ,” King W en said. He sat down in the middle o f the yin-yang symbol , his legs curled under him. He raised his head to look up at the ceiling of the Great Hall, his gaze seeming to penetrate the thick stones of the pyramid, until it reached the stars. The fingers o f his two hands began a series of rapid, complex mov ements, like components of a calculating ma chine. In the silence, only the soup in the cauldron in the corner made any noise, boiling and bubbling as though the shaman being cooked within was dream-talking in his sleep. King W en stood up in the middle of the yin-yang symbol. W ith his face still lifted to the ceiling, he said , “Next will be a Chaotic Era lasting forty- one day s. Then comes a five-d ay Stable Era. Thereafter , there will be a twenty-three-day Chaotic Era followed by an eighteen-day Stable Era. Then we’ll have an ei ght-day Chaotic Era. But when this Chaotic Era is over , my king, the long Stable Era you’ve been waiting for will begin. That Stable Era will last three years and nine months. The climate will be so mild that it will be a golden age.” “W e hav e to verify your initial predictions first,” King Zhou said, his face expressionless. W ang he ard a loud rumbling fro m above. A stone slab in the ceiling of the Great Hall slid open, reve aling a square opening. W ang shifted his position and saw that the opening led to another tunnel going up through the center o f the pyramid. At the en d of the tunnel he could see a few twinkling stars. Game time sped up. Every few seconds in real time, two soldiers flipped over the sandglass brought by King W en, indicating the passi ng of eight hours in game time. The opening through the ceiling flickered with random lights, and once in a while a ray of sunlight from the Chaotic E ra shot into the Grea t Hall. Sometimes the l ight was weak, like moonlight. Sometimes the l ight was ver y strong, and th e incandescent white square cast against the ground glowed so brightly tha t the torches in the Great Hall paled in comparison. W ang co ntinued to count the fl ipping of the sandglass. By the time it had been flipped 120 times or so, the appearance of the sunlight through the square opening became regular . The first of the predicted Stable Eras had arrived.After fif teen mo re flips of the sandglass, the flickering light thro ugh the opening became patternless again, the start of another Chaotic Era. Another Stable Era followed, and anot her Chaotic Era. The starting times and durations of the various eras were not exactly as King W en ha d predicted, but they were close. After the c onclusion of yet another eight-day Chaotic Era, the long Stable Era he predicted began. W ang kept counting the flips of the sandglass. T wenty days passed, and the sunl ight falling into the G reat Hall maintained the precise rhythm. Game time slowed down to normal. King Zhou nodded at King W en. “I shall erect a monument for you, one even greater than this palace.” King W en bowed deeply . “My king, awaken your dynasty a nd let it prosper!” King Zh ou stoo d up on the dais and opened his arms, as though he wanted to embrace the whole world. In a strange, otherworldl y voice, he began to chant, “Re-hy-drate…” As soon as the o rder was given, everyone in the Great Hall rush ed to the door . W ang followed King W en closely , and they exited the pyramid through the long tunnel they’d e ntered by . When they emer ged, W ang saw the n oonday sun bathing the land in warmth. In a passing breeze he seemed to smell the fragrances of spring. T ogether , King W en and W ang walked to a nearby lake. The ice over the lake had melted, and sunlight danced between the gentle waves. A colum n of soldiers shouted, “Rehydrate! Rehydrate!” as they ran toward a lar ge stone building, sh aped like a granary , next to the lake. On the road to Zhao Ge , W ang had seen many buildings like it, and King W en had told him that these buildings were called dehydratories, warehouses where the dehy drated b odies could be stored. The soldiers opened the heavy stone doors of the dehydratory and carried out rolls of dusty skins. E ach soldier walked to the la keshore, and tossed them into the water . As soon as the skins touched the water , they be gan to unfurl and stretch out. Soon, the lake was cov ered by a layer of man-shaped floating skins, e ach rapidly absorbing the water and expan ding. Gradually , all the man-shaped skin cutouts became fleshy bodies th at gradually began to display s igns of life. One by one, the y struggled up out of the waist-deep water an d stood up.Looking around at the sunny w orld with wide-open eyes, they appeared to have just awoken from a dream. “Rehydrate!” one man cried out. “Rehydrate! Rehydrate!” Other voices joyously echoed his. Everyone climbe d out of the lake and ran naked toward the dehy dratory . They ca rried ou t more skins and tossed them into the water , and even more of th e revived climbed out of the lake. The same scene rep eated itself around every lake and pool. The entire world was coming back to life. “Oh, heavens! My finger!” W ang saw a man who had just been revived standing in the middle of the lake, holding up one hand an d crying. The hand was missin g its middle finger , a nd bloo d flowed from the wound into the water . Others, who had also just been revived, passed by him as they happily waded ashore, ignoring him. “Count yourself lucky ,” one o f them said to the man. “Some lost a whole arm or le g. Others had their heads chewed through by rats. If we hadn’ t been rehydrated in time, maybe all of us would have been eaten by the Chaotic Era rats.” “How long have we been dehydrated?” one of the revived asked. “Y ou can tell by looking at the thickness of the dust covering the palace. I j ust heard tha t the king is no longer the king from before. But I don’ t know if he’ s the old king’ s son or grandson.” It to ok e ight days to complete the work of rehydration. All of the stored dehydrated bodi es had been rev ived, and the world was given a new life. During these eight days, everyone enjoyed regular cycles of sunset and sunrise, each cycle precisely twenty hours long. Enjoying the springlike climate, everyon e gave heartfelt praise to the sun and the gods who guided the world. On the night of the eighth day , the bonfires scattered over the ground seemed even more numerous and denser than the stars in the sk y . The ruins of c ities and tow ns abandoned during the Chaotic Eras once again filled with noi se and light. Like every mass rehydration in the past, the people were going to c elebrate all night to welcome their new life after the next sunrise. But the sun did not rise again.Every k ind of timepiece indicat ed that the time for sunrise had passed, but t he h orizon remained dark in every direction. T en hours later , there was still no sign of the sun, not even the slightest hint of dawn. The endless night lasted through a whole day , then two days. Coldness now pressed toward the earth like a giant hand. Inside the pyramid, King W en knelt before King Zhou, pleading, “My king, ple ase continue to have fai th in me. This is but temporary . I have seen the yang of the universe gathering, and the sun will rise soon. The Stable Era and spring will continue!” “Let’ s begin to heat the cauldron,” King Zhou said, and sighed. “Oh, Ki ng!” A minister stumbled through the cavelike entrance into the Great Hall. “There … there are three flying stars in the sky!” Those in the Great Hall were stunned. The air seemed frozen. Only King Zh ou rema ined impassive. He turned to W ang, to whom h e had never deigned to speak before. “Y ou still don’ t understand what the appearance of three flying stars means, do you? Ji Chang, why don’ t you tell him?” “It i ndicates the arrival of a long period of extreme cold, cold enough to turn stone into dust.” King W en sighed. “De-hy-drate…” King Zhou again chanted in that strange, otherworldly voice. O utside, people had already begun the process. They turned themselves back into dehydrated bodies to survive the long night that was coming. The lucky ones had time to be stacked in the dehydr atories, but many were abandoned in the empty fields. King W en stood up slowly and walked toward the cauldron over the roaring fire in t he corner of th e Great Hall. He climbed up the side and paused for a few seconds before jumping in. Perhaps he had seen the thoroughly cooked face of Fu Xi laughing at him from the soup. “Keep th e fire low ,” King Zhou ordered, his voice weak. Then h e turned to the others. “Y ou may exit if you wish. The game is no longer fun after it gets to this point.” A red EXIT sign showed up above the Gr eat Hall’ s cavelike entrance. Players in the Great Hall streamed toward it, and W ang followed the crowd. Through the long tunnel, they finally emer ged outside the pyramid. Heavy snow falling through the night air greeted them. The bone-c hilling cold caused W ang to shiver , and a display in a corner of the sky indicated that game time had sped up again.The snow continued without pause for ten days. By now the sno wflakes were lar ge and heavy , like pieces of solidified darkness. Someone whispered next to W ang, “The snow is now composed of frozen carbon dioxide, dry ice.” W ang turned around and saw that the speaker was Follower . After another ten days, the snow flakes turned thin and translucent. By the weak light fr om a few torche s within the entrance to the long tunnel, the snowflakes gave of f a faint blue glow , like pieces of dancing mica. “Those snowflakes are now composed of solidified oxygen and nitrogen. The atmosphere is disappearing through deposition, which means it’ s near absolute zero above.” Snow gr adually buried the pyramid. The lowest layers were co mposed of water snow , then dry ice, and finally , on top, snow made of oxygen and nitrogen. The night sky became especially clear , and the stars glowed like a field of silver bonfires. A l ine of text appeared against the starry background: The long night lasted forty-eight years. C ivilization Number 137 was destroyed b y the extreme c old. This civilization had advanced to the W arring States Period before succumbing. The seed of civilization remains. It will germinate and again progress through the unpredictable world of Thr ee Body . W e invite you to log on in the future. Before e xiting th e game, W ang noticed the three flying stars in the sky . Revolving closely around each other , they seemed to perform a strange dance against the abyss of space."
地球往事 三体 49 5．叶文洁 汪淼摘下 V装具后，发现自己的内衣已被冷汗浸透了，很像是从 一场寒冷的噩梦中醒来。他走出纳米中心，下楼开车，按丁仪给的地址 去杨冬的母亲家。 乱纪元，乱纪元，乱纪元…… 这个概念在汪淼的头脑中萦绕。为什么那个世界的太阳运行会没 有规律？一个颗状星的行星，不管其运行轨道是正圆还是偏长的椭圆， 其围绕恒星的运动一定是周期性的，全无规律的运行是不可能的…… 汪淼突然对自己很恼火，他使劲地摇头想赶走头脑中的这一切，不过是 个游戏嘛，但他失败了。 乱纪元，乱纪元，乱纪元…… 见鬼！别去想它！ ！为什么非想它不可？为什么？ ！ 很快，汪淼找到了答案。他已经有很多年没有玩过电子游戏了，这 些年来电子游戏的软硬件技术显然已经进化了很多，其中的虚拟现实 场景和附加效果都是他学生时代所无法比拟的。但汪淼明白， 《三体》 的真实不在于此。记得在大三的一次信息课中，教授挂出了两幅大图 片，一幅是画面庞杂精细的《清明上河图》 ，另一幅是一张空旷的天空 照片，空荡荡的蓝天上只有一缕似有似无的白云。教授问这两幅画中哪 一幅所包含的信息量更大，答案是后者要比前者大一至两个数量级！ 《三体》正是这样，它的海量信息是隐藏在深处的，汪淼能感觉到， 但说不清。他突然悟出， 《三体》的不寻常在于，与其他的游戏相比，它 的设计者是反其道而行之 一般游戏的设计者都是尽可能地增加显 中国科幻基石丛书 50 示的信息量，以产生真实感；但《三体》的设计者却是在极力压缩信息 量，以隐藏某种巨大的真实，就像那张看似空旷的天空照片。 汪淼放松了思想的缰绳，任其回到《三体》世界。 飞星！关键在于不引人注意的飞星，一颗飞星，二颗飞星，三颗飞星 ……这分别意味着什么？ 正想着，车已开到他要去的小区大门了。 在要去的那栋楼门口，汪淼看到一位六十岁左右的头发花白、身材 瘦削的女性，戴着眼镜，提着一个大菜篮子吃力地上楼梯。他猜她大概 就是自己要找的人，一问，她果然就是杨冬的母亲，叶文洁。听汪淼说明 来意后，她露出发自内心的感动，她是汪淼常见到的那种老知识分子， 岁月的风霜已消去了他们性情中所有的刚硬和火热，只剩下如水的柔 和。 汪淼拿过菜篮子同她一起上了楼，走进她的家门后发现，这里并不 像他想象的那么冷清有三个孩子在玩耍，最大的不超过五岁，小的 刚会走路。杨母告诉汪淼，这都是邻居的孩子。 “他们喜欢在我这儿玩儿。今天是星期天，他们的父母要加班，就 把他们丢给我了……哦，楠楠，你的画儿画完了吗？嗯，真好看，起个题 目吧！太阳下的小鸭子，好，奶奶给你题上，再写上六月九日，楠楠作 ……中午你们都想吃什么呢？洋洋？烧茄子？好好；楠楠？昨天吃过的 荷兰豆？好好； 你呢， 咪咪？肉肉？不， 你妈妈说了， 不要吃那么多肉肉， 不好消化的，吃鱼鱼好吗？看奶奶买回来的这么大的鱼鱼……” 她肯定想要孙子或孙女，但即使杨冬活着，会要孩子吗？看着杨母 和孩子们投入地对话，汪淼心想。 杨母将篮子提进厨房，出来后对汪淼说： “小汪啊，我先去把菜泡 上，现在的蔬菜农药残留很多，给孩子们吃至少要泡两小时以上……你 可以先到冬冬的房间里看看。 ” 杨母最后一句看似无意的提议令汪淼陷入紧张和不安之中。她显 地球往事 三体 51 然看出了汪淼此行在内心深处的真正目的。她说完就转身回到厨房，没 有看汪淼一眼，自然看不到他的窘态，她这几乎天衣无缝的善解人意令 汪淼一阵感动。 汪淼转身穿过快乐的孩子们，走向杨母刚才指向的那个房间。他在 门前停住了，突然被一种奇异的感觉所淹没，仿佛回到了少年多梦的时 节，一如清晨露珠般晶莹脆弱的感受从记忆的深处中浮起，这里面有 最初的伤感和刺痛，但都是玫瑰色的。 汪淼轻轻推开门，扑面而来的淡淡的气息是他没有想到的，那是森 林的气息，他仿佛进入了一间护林人的林间小屋。墙壁被一条条棕色的 树皮覆盖着，三只凳子是古朴的树桩，写字台也是由三个较大的树桩拼 成的，还有那张床，铺的显然是东北的乌拉草。这一切都很粗糙、很随 意，没有刻意表现出某种美感。以杨冬的职位，她的收入是很高的，可以 在任何一处高尚社区买下房子，可她一直同母亲住在这里。 汪淼走到树桩写字台前，上面的陈设很简单，没有与学术有关的东 西，也没有与女性有关的东西；也许都已经拿走了，也许从来就没在这 里存在过，他首先注意到一张镶在木镜框中的黑白照片，是杨冬母女的 合影，照片中的杨冬正值幼年，母亲蹲下正好同她一样高。风很大，将两 人的头发吹到一起。照片的背景很奇怪，天空呈网格状，汪淼仔细察看 支撑那网络的粗大的钢铁结构，推想那是一个抛物面天线或类似的东 西，因为巨大，它的边缘超出了镜头。 照片中，小杨冬的大眼睛中透出一种令汪淼心颤的恐惶，仿佛照片 外的世界令她恐惧似的。汪淼注意到的第二件东西是放在写字台一角 的一本厚厚的大本子，首先令他迷惑的是本子的材质，他看到封面上有 一行稚拙的字： “杨冬的 huà（桦）皮本。 ”这才知道这本子是桦树皮做 的，时光已经使银白色的桦皮变成暗黄。他伸手触了一下本子，犹豫了 一下又缩了回来。 “你看吧，那是冬冬小时候的画儿。 ”杨母在门口说。 汪淼捧起桦皮本，轻轻地一页页翻看。每幅画上都有日期，明显是 中国科幻基石丛书 52 母亲为女儿注上的，就像他刚进门时看到的那样。汪淼又发现了一件多 少让他不可理解的事：从画上的日期看，这时的杨冬已经三岁多了，这 么大的孩子通常都能够画出比较分明的人或物体的形状；但杨冬的画 仍然只是随意纷乱的线条，汪淼从中看出了一种强烈的恼怒和绝望，一 种想表达某种东西又无能为力的恼怒和绝望，这种感觉，是这种年龄的 普通孩子所不具有的。 杨母缓缓地坐到床沿上，双眼失神地看着汪淼手中的桦皮本，她女 儿就是在这里，在安睡中结束自己的生命。汪淼在杨母身边坐下，他 从来没有过如此强烈的愿望，要与他人分担痛苦。 杨母从汪淼手中拿过桦皮本，抱在胸前，轻声说： “我对冬冬的教 育有些不知深浅，让她太早接触了那些太抽象、太终极的东西。当她第 一次表现出对那些抽象理论的兴趣时，我告诉她，那个世界，女人是很 难进入的。她说居里夫人不是进入了吗？我告诉她，居里夫人根本没有 进入，她的成功只是源于勤奋和执着，没有她，那些工作别人也会完成， 倒是像吴健雄 ① 这样的女人还比她走得远些，但那真的不是女人的世 界。女性的思维方式不同于男性，这没有高下之分，对世界来说都是必 不可少的。 “冬冬没有反驳我。到后来，我真的发现她身上有些特殊的东西， 比如给她讲一个公式，别的孩子会说‘这公式真巧妙’之类的，她则 会说这公式真好看，真漂亮，那神情就像她看到一朵漂亮的野花一样。 她父亲留下了一堆唱片，她听来听去，最后选择了一张巴赫的反复听， 那是最不可能令孩子，特别是女孩子入迷的音乐了。开始我以为她是随 意为之，但问她感受时，这孩子说：她看到一个巨人在大地上搭一座好 大好复杂的房子，巨人一点一点地搭着，乐曲完了，大房子也就搭完了 ……” ①当代最杰出的物理学家之一，在实验物理学研究上取得伟大的成就。她在实验室 中首次证明了李政道和杨振宁关于弱相互作用中宇称不守恒的理论推测，推翻了宇称守 恒定律。 地球往事 三体 53 “您对女儿的教育真是成功。 ”汪淼感慨地说。 “不，是失败啊！她的世界太单纯，只有那纯空灵的理论。那些东西 一崩溃，就没有什么能支撑她活下去了。 ” “叶老师，您这么想我觉得也不对，现在发生了一些让我们难以想 象的事，这是一次空前的理论灾难，做出这种选择的科学家又不只是她 一人。 ” “可只有她一个女人，女人应该像水一样的，什么样的地方都能淌 得过去啊。 ” …… 告辞时，汪淼才想到了来访的另一个目的，于是他向杨母说起了观 测宇宙背景辐射的事。 “哦，这个，国内有两个地方正在做，一个在乌鲁木齐观测基地，好 像是中科院空间环境观测中心的项目；另一个很近，就在北京近郊的射 电天文观测基地，是中科院和北大那个联合天体物理中心搞的。前面那 个是实际地面观察，北京这个只是接收卫星数据，不过数据更准确、全 面一些。那里有我的一个学生，我帮你联系一下吧。 ”杨母说着，去找电 话号码，然后给那个学生打电话，似乎很顺利。 “没问题的，我给你个地址，你直接去就行。他叫沙瑞山，明天正好 值夜班……你好像不是搞这专业的吧？ ”杨母放下电话问。 “我搞纳米， 我这是为了……另外一些事情。 ” 汪淼很怕杨母追问 下去，但她没有。 “小汪啊，你脸色怎么这么不好，好像身体很虚的。 ”杨母关切地 问。 “没什么，就是这样儿。 ”汪淼含糊地说。 “你等等。 ”杨母从柜子里拿出一个小木盒，汪淼看到上面标明是 人参， “过去在基地的一位老战士前两天来看我，带来这个……不，不， 你拿去，人工种植的，不是什么珍贵的东西，我血压高，根本用不着的。 你可以切成薄片泡茶喝，我看你脸色，好像血很亏的样子。年轻人，一定 中国科幻基石丛书 54 要爱护自己啊。 ” 汪淼的心中涌起一股暖流，双眼湿润了，他那颗两天来绷得紧紧的 心脏像被放到了柔软的天鹅绒上。 “叶老师，我会常来看您的。 ”他接过 木盒说。,"8 Y e W e n j i e W ang took of f the V -suit and panoramic viewing helmet. Hi s shirt was soaked w ith swe at, as if he had just awoken from a nightmare. He left the Research Center , got into his ca r , and drove to the address given to him by Ding Y i: the house of Y ang Dong’ s mother . Chaotic Era, Chaotic Era, Chaotic Era … The thought turned and turned in W ang’ s head. Why would the path of the sun thr ough the world of Three Body be devoid of r egularity and pattern? Whether a planet’ s orbit is mor e cir cular or mor e elliptical, its motion ar ound its sun must be periodic. T otal irr egularity in planetary motion is impossible.… W ang gr ew angr y with himself. He shook his head, trying to cha se away these thoughts. It’ s only a game! But I lost. Chaotic Era, Chaotic Era, Chaotic Era … Damn it! Stop! Why am I thinking about this? Why? Soon, W ang found the answer . He had not played any computer games for y ears, and th e hardware for gaming had clearly advanced greatly in the interim. The virtual reality and multisensory feedback were all ef fects he had not experien ced as a young student. But W ang also knew th at the sense of realism in Three Body wasn’ t due to the interface technology . He remembered taking a class in information theory as a third-year student in college. The profess or had put up two pictures: One was thefamous Song Dynasty painting Along t he River During the Q ingming Festival, full of fine, rich details; the other was a photograph of the sky on a sunny day , the deep blue expanse broken only by a wisp of cloud that one couldn’ t even be sure was the re. The professor asked the class which picture contained more informa tion. The answer was that the photograph’ s information contentits entropyexceeded the painting’ s by one or two orders of magnitude. Thr ee Body was the same. Its enormous information content was hidden deep. W ang could feel it, but he could not articulate it. H e suddenly understood that the makers of Thr ee Body took the exact opposite of the approach taken by designers of other games. Normally , game designers tried to display as much information as possible to increase the sense of realism. But Thr ee Body ’ s designers worked to compress the information content to disguise a more complex reality , just like that seemingly empty photograph of the sky . W ang let his mind wander back to the world of Thr ee Body . Flying s tars! The key must be in the flying stars. One flying star , two flying stars, thr ee flying stars … what did they mean? As he had that thought, he found himself at his destination. * * * At the foot of t he apartment building, W ang saw a graying, t hin woman, about sixty years old. She wore glasses and was struggling to go up the stairs with a basket of groceries. He guessed that this was the woman he had come to see. A quick greeting confirmed his guess. She was Y ang Dong’ s mother , Y e W enjie. After hearing the purpose of W ang Miao’ s visit, she was grateful and app reciative. W ang was familiar with old intellectuals like her: The long years had ground away all the hardness and fierceness in their personalities, until all that was left was a gentleness like that of water . W ang carried the grocery baske t up the stairs for her . When the y got to her apartment, it turned out to be not as quiet as he had expected: Three children were playing, the oldest about five, and the youngest barely walking. Y e told W ang that they were all the neighbors’ kids.“They like to pl ay at my place. T oday is Sunday , and their pare nts need to w ork overtime, so they left them to me.… Oh, Nan Nan , have you finished your picture? Oh, it loo ks great! Shall we give it a title? ‘Ducklings in the Sun’? Sou nds good. Let G ranny write it for you. Then I’ll put down the date: ‘June 9 th, by Nan Nan .’ And what do you want to eat for lunch? Y ang Y a ng, you want fried egg plant? Sure! Nan Nan, you wa nt the snow peas lik e you had yesterday? No problem. How about you, Mi Mi? Y ou want some meat-meat? Oh, no, your mom told me that you shouldn’ t eat so much meat-mea t, not easy to digest. How about some fishie instead? Look at this big fishie Granny bought.…” W ang ob served Y e and the child ren, absorbed in their conversation. She must wa nt gran dkids. But even if Y ang Dong wer e alive, would she have had childr en? Y e took the gro ceries into the k itchen. When she reemer ged, she said, “Xiao W ang, I’m going to soak the vegetables for a while.” She had slipped ef fortlessly into addressing him by an af fectionate diminutive. “These days, they use so much pesticide that when I feed the children, I have to soak the vegetables for at least two hou rs Why don’ t you take a look in Dong Dong’ s room first?” Her sug gestion, tagged on at the end as though it was the most natural thing in the world, made W ang anxious. Clearly , she had figured out the real purpose of his visit. She turned around and went back into the kitchen without giving W ang anothe r glance, and so avoided seeing his embarrassment. W ang was gra teful that she was so considerate of his feelings. W ang w alked past the three ha ppily playing children and entered the room that Y e h ad indicated. He paused in front of the door , seized by a strange feeling. It was as if he h ad returned to his dream-filled youth. From the dept hs of his memory arose a tingling sadness, fragile and pure like morning dew , tinged with a rosy hue. Gently , he pushed the door open. The faint fragrance that filled the room was unexpected, the smell of the forest. He seemed to have entered the hut of a ranger: The walls were cov ered by strips of bark; the three stools were unadorned tree stumps; the desk was made from three bigger tree stumps pushed together . And then there was the bed, apparently line d with ura sedge from Northeast China, which the locals stuf fed into their shoes to staywarm in the cold climate. Everything was rough-hewn and seemingly careless, withou t signs of aesthe tic design. Y ang Dong’ s job had earned her a hi gh income, and she could have bought a home in so me luxury development, but she chose to live here with her mother instead. W ang walked up to the tree-stu mp desk. It was plainly furnish ed, and nothing on it be trayed a hint of femininity or scholarly interest. Maybe all such obj ects had been taken aw ay , or maybe they had never been there. He noticed a black-and-white pho tograph in a wooden frame, a portrait of mother a nd daug hter . In the picture, Y ang Dong was just a little girl, and Y e W enjie was crouching down so that they were the same height. A strong wind tangled the pair ’ s long hair together . The background of the photograph was unusual: The sky seem ed to be seen thro ugh a lar ge net held up by thick steel supporting struc tures. W ang deduced that it w as some kind o f parabolic antenna, so lar ge that its edges were beyond the frame of the photograph. In t he picture, little Y ang Dong’ s eyes gave of f a fright th at made W ang’ s heart ache. She seemed terrified by the world outside the picture. Next, W ang noticed a thick note book at the corner of the desk. He was baf fled by the material the notebook was made of until he saw a line of childish writing scrawled across the cover: Y ang Dong’ s Bir ch-bark Notebook . “Birch ” was written in pin yin letters instead of using the character for it. The years had turned the silvery bark into a dull yellow . He reached out to touch the notebook, hesitated, and retracted his hand. “It’ s oka y ,” Y e said from the doo r . “Those are pictures Dong Do ng drew when she was little.” W ang picked up the birch-bark notebook and gently flipped through it. Y e had dated ea ch picture for he r daughter , just like she had been doing for Nan Nan in the living room. W ang sa w that, based on the dat es on the pictures, Y ang Dong was three when she drew them. Normal ly , children of that age are able to draw humans and objects with clear s hapes, but Y ang Dong’ s pictures remained only me sses of random lines. They seemed to express a kind o f passionate anger and desperation born out of a frustrated desire to express something not the sort of feeling one would expect in a child that young. Y e slow ly sat down on the edge of the bed, her eyes staring at the notebook, lost in thought. Her daughter had died here, ended her life whileshe slept. W ang sat next to her . He had never felt such a stro ng desire to share the burden of another ’ s pain. Y e t ook the birch-bark notebook from him and held it to her chest. In a low voi ce, she said, “I wasn’ t good at teaching Dong Dong in an age- appropriate man ner . I exposed her too early to some very ab stract, very extreme topics. When she first expressed an interest in abstra ct theory , I told her that field wasn’ t easy for women. She said, what abo ut Madame Curie? I told her , Madame Curi e was never really accepted as part of that field. He r succe ss was seen as a matter of persistence and hard work, but without her , someone else woul d have completed her work. As a matter of fact, W u Chien-Shiung went even further than Madame Curie.21 But it really isn’ t a woman’ s field. “Dong D ong did n’ t ar gue with m e, but I later discovered that she really was dif f erent. F or example, let’ s say I explained a formula to her . Other children might say , ‘What a c lever formula!’ But she would say , ‘This formula is so elegant, so beautiful.’ The expression on her face was the same as when she saw a pretty wildflower . “Her fat her left behind some records. She listened to all of th em and finally p icked s omething by Bach as her favorite, listening to it over and over . That was t he kind of music that shouldn’ t have mesmeriz ed a kid. At first I thought she picked it on a whim, but when I asked her how she felt about th e music, she said that she could see in the music a giant building, a lar ge, co mplex h ouse. Bit by bit, the giant added to the structure, and when the music was over , the house was done.…” “Y ou were a great teacher for your daughter ,” W ang said. “No. I failed. Her world was to o simple, and all she had were ethereal theories. When they collapsed, she had nothing to lean on to keep on living.” “Professor Y e, I can’ t say that I agree with you. Right now , events are happening that are beyond our i magination. It’ s an unprecedented challenge to o ur theories about the world, and she’ s not the only scientist to have stumbled down that path.” “But she was a woman. A woman should be like water , able to flow over and around anything.” * * *As W ang was about to leave, he remembered the other purpose for his visit. He mentioned to Y e his wish to observe the cosmic microwave background. “Oh, tha t. There are two places in China that work on it. One is an observatory in rümqiI think it’ s a project by the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Space Environment Observation Center . The other is very close by , a radio astro nomy observatory located in the suburbs of Be ijing, which is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Peking University’ s Joint Center for Astrophysics. The on e in rümqi does ground obse rvation, and the one here just receives data from satellites, though the satellite data is more ac curate a nd complete. I have a former student working there, and I can mak e a call for you.” Y e f ound the phone number and di aled it. The ensuing conversation seemed to go smoothly . “Y ou’re all set,” Y e said as she hung up. “Let me give you the address. Y ou can go over anytime. My student’ s name is Sha Ruishan, and he’ s going to be working the night shift tomorrow .… I don’ t think this is your field of research, right?” “I work in nanotech. This is for … something else.” W ang was afraid that Y e was g oing to ask m ore questions about why he sought this information, but she did not. “Xiao W ang, you look a bit pale. How’ s your health?” she asked, her face full of concern. “It’ s nothing. Please don’ t worry .” “W ait a moment.” Y e took a sm all wooden box out of a cabinet. W ang saw from the label that it was ginseng. “An old friend from the base, a soldier , came to visit me a few days ago and brought thistake it, take it! It’ s cultivated, not very precious. I have high blood pressure and can’ t use it anyway . Y ou can slice it thinly and make it into a tea. Y ou look so pale that I’m sure you can use the enrichment. Y ou’re still young, but you have to watch your health.” W ang accepted the box, warmth filling his chest. His eyes moistened. It was as though his heart, stressed almost beyond the breaking point by the last few days, had been placed onto a pile of soft down feathers . “Professor Y e, I will come visit you often.”"
地球往事 三体 55 6．宇宙闪烁之一 汪淼驱车沿京密路到密云县，再转至黑龙潭，又走了一段盘山路， 便到达中科院国家天文观测中心的射电天文观测基地。他看到二十八 面直径为九米的抛物面天线在暮色中一字排开，像一排壮观的钢铁植 物， 2006 年建成的两台高大的五十米口径射电望远镜天线矗立在这排 九米天线的尽头，车驶近后，它们令汪淼不由想起了那张杨冬母女合影 的背景。 但叶文洁的学生从事的项目与这些射电望远镜没有什么关系，沙 瑞山博士的实验室主要接收三颗卫星的观测数据： 1989 年11月升空、 即将淘汰的微波背景探测卫星 COBE ，2003 年发射的威尔金森微波各 向异性探测卫星 WMAP 和2007 年欧洲航天局发射的普朗克高精度宇 宙微波背景探测卫星 Planck 。 宇宙整体的微波背景辐射频谱非常精确地符合温度为 2.726K 的 黑体辐射谱，具有高度各向同性，但在不同局部也存在大约百万分之五 涨落的幅度。沙瑞山的工作就是根据卫星观测数据，重新绘制一幅更精 确的全宇宙微波辐射背景图。这个实验室不大，主机房中挤满了卫星数 据接收设备，有三台终端分别显示来自三颗卫星的数据。 沙瑞山见到汪淼，立刻表现出了那种长期在寂寞之地工作的人见 到来客的热情，问他想了解哪方面的观测数据。 “我想观测宇宙背景辐射的整体波动。 ” “您能……说具体些吗？ ”沙瑞山看汪淼的眼神变得奇怪起来。 “就是，宇宙 3K微波背景辐射整体上的各向同性的波动，振幅在 中国科幻基石丛书 56 百分之一至百分之五之间。 ” 沙瑞山笑笑，早在本世纪初，密云射电天文基地就对游客开放参 观，为挣些外快，沙瑞山时常做些导游或讲座的事，这种笑容就是他回 答游客（他已适应了他们那骇人的科盲）问题时常常露出的。 “汪先生， 您……不是搞这个专业的吧？ ” “我搞纳米材料。 ” “哦，那就对了。不过，对于宇宙 3K背景辐射，您大概有个了解 吧？” “知道的不多。目前的宇宙起源理论认为，宇宙诞生于距今约一百 四十亿年前的一次大爆炸，在诞生早期，宇宙温度极高，随后开始冷却， 形成被称为微波背景辐射的‘余烬’ 。这种弥漫全宇宙的残留背景辐 射，在厘米波段上是可以观测到的。好像是在一九六几年吧。两个美国 人在调试一个高精度卫星接收天线时意外地发现了宇宙背景辐射 ……” “足够了。 ”沙瑞山挥手打断了汪淼的话， “那你就应该知道，与我 们观测的不同部分的微小不均匀不同，宇宙整体辐射背景波动是随着 宇宙的膨胀，在宇宙时间尺度上缓慢变化的，以 Planck 卫星的精度，直 到一百万年后都未必能测出这种变化，你却想在今天晚上发现它百分 之五的波动？ ！知道这意味着什么吗？这意味着整个宇宙像一个坏了的 日光灯管那样闪烁！ ” 而且是为我闪烁。汪淼心里说。 “叶老师这是在开什么玩笑。 ”沙瑞山摇摇头说。 “但愿真是个玩笑。 ”汪淼说，本想告诉他，叶文洁并不知道详情， 但又怕因此招致他的拒绝，不过这倒是他的心里话。 “既然是叶老师交待的，就观测吧，反正也不费劲，百分之一的精 度，用老古董 COBE 就行了。 ”沙瑞山说着，在终端上忙活起来，很快屏 幕上出现一条平直的绿线， “你看，这就是当前宇宙整体背景辐射的实 时数值曲线，哦，应该叫直线才对，数值是 2.726 ±0.010K ，那个误差是 地球往事 三体 57 银河系运动产生的多普勒效应，已经滤掉了。如果发生你所说的超过百 分之一振幅的波动，这条线就会变红并将波动显示出来。我敢打赌直到 世界末日它也是条绿直线，要看到它显现肉眼看得到的变化，可能比看 太阳毁灭还要等更长的时间。 ” “这不会影响您的正常工作吧？ ” “当然不会，那么粗的精度，用 COBE 观察数据的边角料就足够 了。好了，从现在开始，如果那伟大的波动出现，数值会自动存盘。 ” “可能要等到凌晨一点。 ” “哇，这么精确？没关系，反正我本来就是值夜班。您吃饭了吗？那 好，我带您去参观一下吧。 ” 这一夜没有月亮，他们沿着长长的天线阵列漫步。沙瑞山指着天线 说： “壮观吧？可惜都是聋子的耳朵。 ” “为什么？ ” “自它们建成以来，在观测频段上就干扰不断，先是上世纪八十年 代末的寻呼台，到现在是疯狂发展的移动通信。这些米波综合孔径射电 望远镜能做的那些项目，像米波巡天、射电变源、超新星遗迹研究等等， 大部分都不能正常开展。多次找过无委会（国家无线电管理委员会） ， 没有用， 我们能玩得过中国移动、 联通、 网通？没有钱， 宇宙奥秘算个球！ 好在我的项目靠卫星数据，与这些 ‘旅游景观’ 无关了。 ” “近年来很多基础研究的商业运行还是很成功的，比如高能物理。 把观测基地建到离城市远些的地方应该好些吧？ ” “那还是钱的问题。就目前而言，只能是在技术上屏蔽干扰。唉，叶 老师要在就好了，她在这方面造诣很深。 ” 然后，他们来到一间为游客开的通宵酒吧。沙瑞山一杯接着一杯地 灌啤酒，变得更加健谈。话题集中在叶文洁身上。从她的学生那里，汪淼 得知了她那历经风霜的前半生。中国科幻基石丛书 88 10．宇宙闪烁之二 沙瑞山告诉汪淼，叶文洁九十年代初才又回到了这座城市，在父亲 曾工作过的大学中讲授天体物理学直到退休。 “最近才知道，她那二十多年，是在红岸基地度过的。 ” 汪淼被沙瑞山的讲述震撼了，好半天才对他最后一句话有了反应， “难道那些传说……” “大部分是真的。红岸自译解系统的一名研制者移民到欧洲，去年 写了一本书，你所说的传说大多来自于那本书，据我了解是真的。红岸 工程的参与者大都还健在。 ” “这可真是……传奇啊！ ” “尤其是发生在那个年代，更是传奇中的传奇。 ” …… 照向射电天线阵列的聚光灯已经熄灭，天线在夜空下变成了简明 的黑色二维图案，仿佛是一排抽象的符号，以同一个仰角齐齐地仰望着 宇宙，似乎在等待着什么。这景象令汪淼不寒而栗，他想起了《三体》中 的那些巨摆。 回到实验室时正好是凌晨一点，当他们将目光投向终端屏幕时，波 动刚刚出现，直线变成了曲线，出现了间隔不一的尖尖的波峰，颜色也 变红了，如同一条冬眠后的蛇开始充血蠕动了。 “肯定是 COBE 卫星的故障！ ”沙瑞山惊恐地盯着曲线说。 “不是故障。 ”汪淼平静地说，在这样的事情面前，他已经初步学会 了控制自己。 地球往事 三体 89 “我们马上就能知道！ ”沙瑞山说着，在另外两台终端上快速操作 起来。很快，他调出了另外两颗卫星 WMAP 和Planck 的宇宙背景辐射 实时数据，并将其变化显示为曲线 三条曲线在同步波动，一模一样。 沙瑞山又搬出一台笔记本电脑，手忙脚乱地启动系统，插上宽带网 线，然后打电话汪淼听出他在联系乌鲁木齐射电观测基地然 后等待着。他没有对汪淼解释什么，两眼死盯着屏幕上的浏览器，汪淼 能听到他急促的呼吸声。几分钟后，浏览器上出现了一个坐标窗口，一 条红色曲线在窗口上出现，与另外三条进行着精确同步的波动。 这样，三颗卫星和一套地面观测设备同时证实了一件事：宇宙在闪 烁！ “能将前面的曲线打印出来吗？”汪淼问。 沙瑞山抹了一把头上的冷汗，点点头，移动鼠标启动了打印程序。 汪淼迫不及待地抓过激光打印机吐出的第一张纸。用一枝铅笔划过曲 线，将波峰间的距离与他刚拿出来的那张莫尔斯电码表对照起来。 短长长长长、短长长长长、短短短短短、长长长短短、长长短短长 长、短短长长长、短短短短长、长长短短长长、短短短长长、长长短短短， 这是 1108:21:37 。 短长长长长、短长长长长、短短短短短、长长长短短、长长短短长 长、短短长长长、短短短短长、长长短短长长、短短短长长、长短短短短， 这是 1108:21:36 。 短长长长长、短长长长长、短短短短短、长长长短短、长长短短长 长、短短长长长、短短短短长、长长短短长长、短短短长长、短短短短短， 这是 1108:21:35 。 …… 倒计时在宇宙尺度上继续，还剩 1108 小时？ 沙瑞山焦躁地来回踱步，不时在汪淼身后停下来看看他正在写出 的那一串数字， “你真的不能把实情告诉我吗？ ！ ”他耐不住大声问。 中国科幻基石丛书 90 “沙博士，相信我，一时说不清的。 ”汪淼推开那一堆印着波动曲线 的纸，盯着那行倒计时数字， “也许，三颗卫星和一个地面观测点都出 现了故障。 ” “你知道这不可能！ ” “如果有人故意破坏呢？ ” “也不可能！同时改变三颗卫星和一个地面观测站的数据？那这破 坏也有些超自然了。 ” 汪淼点点头，比起宇宙闪烁来，他宁愿接受这个超自然。但沙瑞山 立刻抽走了他怀中这唯一的一根救命稻草。 “要想最终证实这一切，其实很简单。宇宙背景辐射这样幅度的波 动，已经大到我们能用肉眼觉察的程度。 ” “你胡说什么？现在是你在违反常识了：背景辐射的波长是 7厘 米，比可见光大了七八个数量级，怎么能看到？ ” “用 3K眼镜。 ” “3K眼镜？ ” “是我们为首都天文馆做的一个科普小玩意儿。现在的技术，已经 能将彭齐阿斯和威尔逊在四十多年前用于发现 3K背景辐射的二十英 尺的喇叭形天线做成眼镜大小，并且在这个眼镜中设置一个转换系统， 将接收到的背景辐射的波长压缩七个数量级，将 7厘米波转换成红光。 这样， 观众在夜里藏上这种眼镜， 就能亲眼看到宇宙的 3K背景辐射， 现 在，也能看到宇宙闪烁。 ” “这东西现在哪儿？ ” “在天文馆，有二十副呢。 ” “我必须在五点以前拿到它。 ” 沙瑞山拿起电话拨了个号码，对方很长时间才接起电话，沙瑞山费 了不少口舌才说服那个被半夜叫醒的人一小时后在天文馆等汪淼。 临别时沙瑞山说： “我就不同您去了，刚才看到的已经足够，我不 需要这样的证明。我还是希望您能在适当的时候把实情告诉我，如果这 地球往事 三体 91 种现象引出什么研究成果的话，我不会忘记您的。 ” “闪烁在凌晨五点就会停止，以后别去深究它吧，相信我，不会有 什么成果的。 ”汪淼扶着车门说。 沙瑞山对着汪淼注视良久，点点头： “明白了，现在科学界出了一 些事……” “是的。 ”汪淼说着，钻进车里，他不想把这个话题继续下去了。 “轮到我们了吗？ ” “至少轮到我了。 ”汪淼说着发动了车子。 汪淼一小时后到达市内，他在新天文馆前下了车。城市午夜的灯光 透过这栋巨大玻璃建筑的透明幕墙，将内部的结构隐隐约约显现出来。 汪淼现在体会到，如果新天文馆的建筑师想表达对宇宙的感觉，那他成 功了越透明的东西越神秘，宇宙本身就是透明的，只要目力能及， 你想看多远就看多远，但越看越神秘。 那名睡眼惺忪的天文馆工作人员已经在门口等汪淼了，他把一个 手提箱递给汪淼， “这里面有五副 3K眼镜，都是充好电的，左边的按钮 是开关，右边是光度调节。上面还有十几副，你想怎么看就怎么看吧，我 先去睡会儿，就在靠门口那个房间。这个沙博士，真是个神经病。 ”说完 转身走进昏暗的馆内。 汪淼将箱子放到车座上打开，拿出一副 3K眼镜，这东西很像他刚 用过的 V装具中的头盔显示器。他拿起一副走到车外戴上，透过镜片看 到的城市夜景没有变化，只是暗了些，这时他才想起要将开关打开，立 刻，城市化作一团团朦胧的光晕，大部分亮度固定，还有一些闪烁或移 动着。他知道，这都是被转化为可见光的厘米微波，每团光晕的中心就 是一个发射源，由于波长的原因，不可能看清形状。 他抬起头，看到了一个发着暗红色微光的天空，就这样，他看到了 宇宙背景辐射，这红光来自于一百多亿年前，是大爆炸的延续，是创世 纪的余温。看不到星星，本来，由于可见光波段已被推至不可见，星星应 中国科幻基石丛书 92 该是一个个黑点，但厘米波的衍射掩没了一切形状和细节。 当汪淼的眼睛适应了这一切后，他看到了天空的红光背景在微微 闪动，整个太空成一个整体在同步闪烁，仿佛整个宇宙只是一盏风中的 孤灯。 站在这闪烁的苍穹下，汪淼突然感到宇宙是这么小，小得仅将他一 人禁锢于其中。宇宙是一个狭小的心脏或子宫，这弥漫的红光是充满于 其中的半透明的血液，他悬浮于血液中，红光的闪烁周期是不规则的， 像是这心脏或子宫不规则地脉动，他从中感受到了一个以人类的智慧 永远无法理解的怪异变态的巨大存在。 汪淼摘下 3K眼镜，虚弱地靠着车轮坐在地上。在他的眼中，午夜 的城市重新恢复了可见光波段所描绘的现实图景，但他的目光游移，在 捕捉另外一些东西：对面动物园大门旁的一排霓虹灯中有一根灯管坏 了，不规则地闪烁着；近处的一棵小树上的树叶在夜风中摇动，反射着 街灯的光，不规则地闪烁着；远处北京展览馆俄式尖顶上的五角星也在 反射着下面不同街道上车灯的光，不规则地闪烁着…… 汪淼按莫尔斯电码努力破译着这些闪烁。他甚至觉得，旁边几幅彩 旗正在风中飘出的皱褶、路旁一洼积水表面的涟漪，都向他传递着莫尔 斯电码……他努力地破译着，感受着幽灵倒计时的流逝。 不知过了多久，那个天文馆的工作人员出来了，问汪淼看完了没 有。当看到他时，他的样子使那人双眼中的睡意一下子消失了。收拾好 了3K眼镜的箱子，那人又盯着汪淼看了几秒钟，提着箱子快步走了回 去。 汪淼拿出手机，拨通了申玉菲的电话，她很快就接了，也许她也度 过一个不眠之夜。 “倒计时的尽头是什么？”汪淼无力地问。 “不知道。 ”说了这简短的三个字后，电话挂断了。 是什么？也许是自己的死亡，像杨冬那样；也许是一场像前几年印 地球往事 三体 93 度洋海啸那样的大灾难，谁也不会将其与自己的纳米研究项目相联系 （由此联想到，以前的每一次大灾难，包括两次世界大战，是否都是一 次次幽灵倒计时的尽头？都有一个谁都想不到的像自己这样的人要负 的最终责任） ；也许是全世界的彻底毁灭，在这个变态的宇宙中，那倒 对谁都是一种解脱……有一点可以肯定，不管幽灵倒计时的尽头是什 么，在这剩下的千余个小时中，对尽头的猜测将像恶魔那样残酷地折磨 他，最后在精神上彻底摧毁他。 汪淼钻进车子，离开了天文馆，在城市里漫无目的地开着。黎明前， 路上很空，但他不敢开快，仿佛车开得快，倒计时走得也快。当东方出现 一线晨光时，他将车停在路边，下车走了起来，同样漫无目标的。他的意 识中一片空白，只有倒计时在那暗红的背景辐射上显现着，跳动着，他 自己仿佛变成了一个单纯的计时器，一口不知道为谁而鸣的丧钟。天亮 了起来，他走累了，在一条长椅上坐下来，当他抬头看看自己下意识走 到的目的地时，不由打了个寒颤。 他正坐在王府井天主教堂前。在黎明惨白的天空下，教堂的罗马式 尖顶像三根黑色的巨指，似乎在为他指出冥冥太空中的什么东西。 汪淼起身要走，一阵从教堂传出的圣乐留住了他。今天不是礼拜 日，这可能是唱诗班为复活节进行的排练，唱的是这个节日弥撒中常唱 的《圣灵光照》 。在圣乐的庄严深远中，汪淼再次感到宇宙变小了，变成 了一座空旷的教堂，穹顶隐没于背景辐射闪烁的红光中，而他则是这宏 伟教堂地板砖缝中的一只小蚂蚁。他感觉到自己那颗颤抖的心灵被一 只无形的巨手抚摸着，一时间又回到了脆弱无助的孩童时代，意识深处 硬撑着的某种东西像蜡一样变软了，崩溃了。他双手捂着脸哭了起来。 “哈哈哈，又放倒了一个！ ” 汪淼的哭泣被身后的一阵笑声打断，他扭头一看，大史站在那里， 嘴里吐出一口白烟。,"9 T h e U n i v e r s e F l i c k e r s W ang M iao drov e along Jingmi Road until he was in Miyun Co unty . From there he headed to Heilongtan, climbed up the mountain along a winding road, and arrived at the radio astronomy observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ National Astronomical Center . He saw a line of twenty-eight parabolic antenna d ishes, each with a diameter of nine meters, like a row of spectacular steel plants. At the end were tw o tall radio telescopes with dishes fifty meters in diameter , built in 2006. As he drove closer , W ang cou ld not help but think of the background in the picture of Y e and her daughter . But the work of Sha Ruishan, Y e’ s student, had nothing to do with these radio tel escopes. Dr . Sha’ s lab was mainly responsible for receiv ing the data transmitted from three satellites: the Cosmic Background Explorer , COBE, launched in November of 1989 and about to be retired; the W ilkinson Microwave Ani sotropy Probe, WMAP , launched in 2003; and Planck, the space observatory launched by the European Space Agency in 2009. Cosmic microwave background radiation very precisely matc hed the thermal black body spectrum at a temperature of 2.7255 K and was highly isotropicmeaning nearly uniform in every directionwith only tiny temperature fluctuations at the parts per million range. Sha Ruishan’ s job was to create a more detailed m ap of the cosmic microwave background using observational data.The lab wasn’ t very big. Equipment for receiving satellite data was squeezed into the main comput er room, and three terminals di splayed the information sent by the three satellites. Sha was excited to see W ang. Clearly bored with his long isolation and happy to have a visitor , he asked W ang what kind of data he wanted to see. “I w ant to see the overall fluctuation in the cosmic mi crowave background.” “Can you … be more specific?” “What I mean is … I want to se e the isotropic fluctuation in the overall cosmic microwave background, between one and five percent,” he said, quoting from Shen’ s email. Sha grin ned. Starting at the turn of the century , the Miyun Radio Astronomy Obs ervatory had opened itself to visitors. In order to earn some extra income, Sha often played the role of tour guide or gave le ctures. This was the grin he reserved for tourists, as he had grown used to their astounding scien tific illiteracy . “Mr . W ang, I take it you’re not a specialist in the field?” “I work in nanotech.” “Ah, ma kes sen se. But you mus t have some basic understanding of the cosmic microwave background?” “I don’ t know much. I know that as the universe cooled after the big bang, the leftover ‘embers’ beca me the cosmic microwave background. The radiation fills the entire universe and can be observed in the centimeter wavelength range. I think it was back in the sixties when two Americans accidentally discovered the radiation when they were testing a supersensitive satellite reception antenna” “That’ s more than enough,” Sha interrupted, waving his hands. “Then you must know that unlike the local variations we observe in dif ferent parts of the universe, the overall fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background is correl ated wi th the expansion of the universe. It’ s a very s low change measured at the scale of the age of the universe. Even with the sensitivity of the Planck satellite, continuous observation for a million year s might not detect any s uch sh ift. But you want to see a five percent fluctuation tonigh t? Do you realize what that would mean? The universe would flicker like a fluorescent tube that’ s about to burn out!” And it will be flickering for me, W ang thought.“This must be some joke from Professor Y e,” Sha said. “Nothing would please me mor e than to discover that it was a joke,” W ang said. He w as about to tel l Sha that Y e didn’ t know the details of his request, but he was afraid that Sha would then refuse to help him. “W ell, s ince Pro fessor Y e asked me to help you, let’ s do the observation. It’ s not a big deal. If you just need one percent precision, da ta from the antique COBE is suf ficient.” As he spoke, Sha typed qui ckly at the terminal. Soon a flat green line appeared on the screen. “This curve is the real-time measu rement of the overall cosmic microwave backg roundoh, calling it a str aight line would be more accurate. The tem perature is 2.725 ± 0.002K. The error range is due to the Doppler ef fect from the motion of the Milky W ay , which has already been filtered out. If the kind of fluctuation you anticipatein excess of one percentoccurs, this line would tu rn red and become a wa veform. I would bet that it’ s going to stay a flat green line until the end of the world, though. If you want to see it show the k ind of fluct uation observab le by the naked eye, you might have to wait until long after the death of the sun.” “I’m not interfering in your work, am I?” “No. Since you need such low precision, we can just use some basic data from COBE . Okay , it’ s all set. From now on, if such great fluctuations occur , the data will be automatically saved to disk.” “I think it might happen around one o’clock A.M .” “W ow , so precise! No problem, since I’m working the night shift, anyway . Have you had dinner yet? Good, then I’ll take you on a tour .” The nigh t was moonless. They walked along the row of antenna dishes, and Sha pointed to them. “Brea thtaking, aren’ t they? It’ s too b ad that they are all like the ears of a deaf man.” “Why?” “Ever since construction wa s completed, interference ha s been unceasing in the observational bands. First, there were the paging stations during the eighties. Now , it’ s the scramble to develop mobile communications networks and c ell towers. These telescopes are capable of many scientific taskssurveying the sky , detecting variable radio sources, observing the remains of supernovaebut we can’ t perform most of them. W e’ve c omplained to the State Regulatory Radio Commission many times, never w ith any results. How can we get more attention than Ch ina Mobile,China U nicom, China Netcom? W ithout money , the secrets of the universe are worth shit. At least my project only depends on satellite d ata and has nothing to do with these ‘tourist attractions.’” “In rece nt years, commercial operation of basic research has been fairly successful, like in high-ener gy physics. Maybe it would be b etter if the observatories were built in places farther away from cities?” “It all comes down to money . Right now , our only choice is to find technical means to shield against interference. W ell, it would be much better if Professor Y e were here. She accomplished a lot in this field.” So the topic of conversation turned to Y e W enjie. And from her student, W ang finally learned about her life. He listened as Sha told of how she witnessed the death of her father during the Cultural Revolutio n, how she was falsely accused at the Production and Construction Corps, how she then seemed to disappear until her return to Beijing at the beginning of the nineties, when she began teac hing astrophysics at T singhua, where her father had also taught, until her retirement. “It w as o nly rece ntly revealed that she had spent more than twen ty years at Red Coast Base.” W ang was stunned. “Y ou mean, those rumors” “Most tu rned ou t to be true. One of the researchers who developed the deciphering sys tem for the Red Coast Project emigrated to Europe and wrote a book las t year . Most of the rumors you hear came out o f that book. Many who participated in Red Coast are still alive.” “That is … a fantastical legend.” “Especially for it to happen during those yearsabsolutely incredible.” They continued to speak for a while. Sha asked the purpose behind W ang’ s strange request. W ang avoided giving a straight answ er , and Sha didn’ t press. The dignity of a s pecialist did not allow Sha to express too much interest in a request th at clearly went against his professional knowledge. Then they went to an all-night b ar for tourists and sat for two hours. As Sha finished one beer after ano ther , his tongue loosened even more. But W ang be came anxious, and his mind kept returning to that green line on the terminal in Sha’ s of fice. It was only at ten to one in the morni ng that Sha finally gave in to W ang’ s repeated pleas to go back to the lab.The spotlights that had lit up the row of radio antennas had been turned of f, and the ante nnas now formed a simple two-dimensional picture against the nigh t sky like a series of abstract symbols. All of them gazed up at the sky at the same angle, as though waiting expectantly for something. The scene made W ang shudder despite the warmth of the spring evening. He was reminded of the giant pendulums in Thr ee Body . They arrived back at the lab at one. As they looked at the term inal, the fluctuation was just getting started. The flat line turned into a wave, the distance between one peak and t he next inconstant. The line’ s co lor became red, like a snake awakening afte r hibernation, wriggling as its skin refilled with blood. “It must be a malfunction in COBE!” Sha stared at the waveform, terrified. “It’ s not a malf unction.” W ang’ s tone was exceedingly calm. He had learned to control himself when faced with such sights. “W e’ll know soon enough,” Sha said. He went to the other two terminals and typed rapidly to bring up the data gathered by th e other two satellites, WMAP and Planck. Now three waveforms moved in sync across the three terminals, exactly alike. Sha took out a notebook compu ter and rushed to turn it on. He plugged in a netw ork cable and picked up the phone. W ang could tell fr om the one- sided co nversation that he was trying to get in touch with the rümqi radio astronomy obser vatory . He didn’ t explain to W ang what he was doing, his eyes locked onto the browser window on the notebook. W ang could hear his rapid breathing. A few minutes l ater , a red wave form appeared in the browser window , moving in step with the other three. The three satellites and the ground-based observatory confirmed one fact: The universe was flickering. “Can you print out the waveform?” W ang asked. Sha wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead and nodded. He moved his m ouse and clicked “Print.” W ang grabbed the first page as soon as it came ou t of the laser printer , and , with a pencil, began to match the distance between the peaks with the Morse code chart he took out of his pocket.short-long-long-long-long, short-long-long-long-long, long-long-long- long-long, long-long-long-short-short, long-long-long-short-short-short, short-short-long-long-long, short-long-long-long-long, long-long-long- short-short-short, short-short-short-long-long, long-long-short-short-short.

The countdown continued at the scale of the universe. Ninety-tw o hours had already elapsed, and only 1,108 hours remained. Sha pac ed back and forth anxiously , pausing from time to time to look at the sequence of numbers W ang was writing down. “Can’ t you tell me what’ s going on?” he shouted. “I can’ t possibly explain this to you, Dr . Sha. T rust me.” W ang pushed away the pile of papers filled wi th waveforms. As he stared at the sequence of n umbers, he s aid, “Maybe the three satellites and the observatory are all malfunctioning.” “Y ou know that’ s impossible!” “What if it’ s sabotage?” “Also im possible! T o simultane ously alter the data from three satellites and an observatory on Earth? Y ou’re talking about a supernatural saboteur .” W ang nodded. Compared to t he idea of the universe flicke ring, he would p refer a supernatural sabo teur . But Sha then deprived him of this last glimmer of hope. “It’ s easy t o confirm this. If the cosmic microwave background is fluctuating this m uch, we should be able to see it with our own eyes.” “What are you t alking about? The wavelength of the cosmic mi crowave background is seven centimete rs. That’ s five orders of magnitude longer than the wavelength of visible light. How can we possibly see it?” “Using 3K glasses.” “Three-K glasses?” “It’ s a sort of science toy we made for the Capital Planetarium. W ith our current level of technology , we could take the six-meter horn antenna used by Penz ias and W ilson almost half a century ago to discover the cosmicmicrowave background and miniaturize it to the size of a pair of glasses. Then we added a converter in th e glasses to compress the detect ed radiation by five orders o f magnitude so that seven-centimeter waves are turned into visible red light. This way , visitors can put on the glasses at night and observe the cosmic microwave b ackground on their own. And now , we can use it to see the universe flicker .” “Where can I find these glasses?” “At the Capital Planetarium. W e made more than twenty pairs.” “I must get my hands on a pair before five.” Sha pick ed up the phone. The other side picked up only after a long while. Sha had to expend a lot o f ener gy to convince the person awakened in the middle o f the night to go to the planetarium and wait for W ang’ s arrival in an hour . As W ang left, Sh a said, “I won’ t go with you. What I’ve seen is enough, and I don’ t need any more con firmation. But I hope that you will explain the t ruth to me when you feel t he time is right. If this phenomenon should lead to some research result, I won’ t for get you.” W ang opened the car door and said, “The flickering will stop a t five in the m orning. I’d suggest you not pursue it after this. Believe me, you won’ t get anywhere.” Sha star ed at W ang for a long time and then nodded. “I understand. Strange things have been happening to scientists lately .…” “Y es.” W ang ducked into the car . He didn’ t want to discuss the subject any further . “Is it our turn?” “It’ s my turn, at least.” W ang started the engine. * * * An hour later , W ang arrived at the new planetarium and got out of the car . The brig ht lights of the city penetrated the translucent walls of the immense glass bu ilding and dimly revealed its internal structure. W ang th ought that if the a rchitect had intended to express a feeling about the universe, the design was a success: The more transpa rent something was, the more m ysterious it seemed. The universe itself was transparent; as long as you weresuf ficiently sharp-eyed, you could see as far as you liked. But the farther you looked, the more mysterious it became. The slee py-eyed planetarium sta f fer was waiting by the door for W ang. He handed him a small suitcase and said, “There are five p airs of 3K glasses i n here, all fully char ge d. The left button switches it on. The right dial is for adjusting brightness. I have a dozen more pairs upsta irs. Y ou can look as much as you like, but I’m going to take a nap now in th e room over there. T his Dr . Sha must be me ntal.” He went into the dim interior of the planetarium. W ang op ened th e suitcase on the backseat of his car and took out a pair of 3K glasses. It resembled the display inside the panoramic viewing helmet of the V -suit. He put the glasses on and looked around. The city looked the same as before, only dimmer . T hen he remembered that he ha d to switch them on. The city turned into many hazy glowing halos. Most were fixed, but a few flick ered or moved. He real ized that these were sources of radiation in the c entimeter range, all now converted to visible light. At the h eart of each halo was a radia tion source. Because the original wavelengths w ere so long, it was impossible to see their shapes clearly . He lifted his hea d and saw a sky glowing with a faint red light. Just like that, he was seeing the cosmic microwave background. The red light ha d come from mo re than ten billion years ago. It was the remnants of the big bang, the still-warm embers of Creation. He could not see any stars. Normally , since visible light would be compressed to invisible by the glasses, each star should appear as a black dot. But the dif fraction of centimeter -wave radiation overwhelmed all other shapes and details. Once his eyes had grown used to the sight, W ang could see that the faint red background was indeed pulsing. The entire sky flickered, as if the universe was but a quivering lamp in the wind. Standing under the flashing dom e of the night sky , W ang suddenly felt the universe shrink until it was so small that only he was imprisoned in it. The universe was a cramped heart, and the red light that suf fused everything was the translucent b lood that filled the or gan. Suspended in the blood, he saw that the flickering of the red light was not periodicthe pulsing was irregular . He felt a strange, perverse, immense presence that could never be understood by human intellect.W ang took of f the 3K glasses and sat down weakly on the ground, leaning against the wheel of his car . The city at night graduall y recovered the reali ty of visible light. But his eyes roamed, trying to ca pture other sights. By the en trance of the zoo across the street, there was a row of neon lights. O ne of the lights was a bout to burn out and flickered irregularly . Nearby , a small tree’ s leaves trembled in the night breeze, twinkling without pattern as they reflected streetlight. In the distance, the red star atop the Beijing Exhibition Center ’ s Rus sian-style spire reflected the light from the cars passing below , also twinkling randomly .… W ang tried to interpret the flickers as Morse code. He even felt that the wrinkles in the flags flapping n ext to him and the ripples in th e puddle on the side of the road might be sending him messages. He s truggled to understand all the messages, and felt the passing of the countdown, second by second. He didn’ t know how long he stayed there. The planetarium staf fer finally e mer ged and asked him whether he was done. But when he saw W ang’ s face, sleep disappeared from the staf fer ’ s eyes and was replaced by fear . He packed up the 3K glasses, stared at W ang for a few seconds, and quickly left with the suitcase. * * * W ang took out his mobile and dialed Shen Y ufei’ s number . She picked up right away . Perhaps she was also suf fering from insomnia. “What happens at the end of the countdown?” W ang asked. “I don’ t know .” She hung up. What can it be? Maybe my own death, like Y ang Dong’ s. Or maybe it will be a disaster like the gr eat tsunami that swept thr ough the Indian Ocean mor e than a decade ago. No one will connect it to my nanotech r esear ch. Could it be that every pr evious gr eat disaste r , including the two W orld W ars, was also the r esult of r eaching the end of ghostly countdowns? Could it be that every time ther e was someone like me, who no one thought of, who bor e the ultimate r esponsibility? Or maybe it sign als the end of the whole world. In this pervers e world, that would be a r elief.One thin g was certain. No matte r what was at the end of the countdown, in the remaining one thousand or so hours, the possibilities would torture him cruelly , like demons, until he suf fered a complete mental breakdown. W ang ducked back into the ca r and left the planetarium. Just before dawn, the roads were relatively empty . But he didn’ t dare to drive too fast, feeling that the faster the car moved, the faster the countdown would go. When a glimmer of light appeared in the eastern sky , he parked and walked around aimlessl y . His mind was empty of thoughts: Only the countdown pulsed a gainst the dim red background of cosmic radiation. H e seemed to have turned into nothing but a simple timer , a bell that tolled for he knew not whom. The sky brightened. He was tired, so he sat down on a bench. When he lifted his head to see where his subconscious had brought him, he shivered. He s at in front of St. Joseph’ s C hurch at W angfujing. In the pale white light of dawn, the church’ s Ro manesque vaults appeared as three giant fingers pointing out something in space for him. As W ang got up to leave, he was held back by a snippet of hymnal music. I t wasn’ t Sunday , so it was likely a choir rehearsal. Th e song was “Come, Gracious Spirit, Heave nly Dove.” As he listened to the solemn, sacred m usic, W ang Miao once again felt that the universe had shrunk until it was the size of an empty church. The domed ceiling was hidden by the flashing red light of the background radiation, and he was an a nt crawling through the cracks in the floor . He felt a giant, invisible hand c aressing his trembling heart, and he was once again a helpless babe. Something deep in his mind that had once held him up softened like wax and co llapsed. He covered his eyes and began to cry . W ang’ s cries were interrupted b y laughter . “Hahaha, another one bites the dust!” He turned around. Captain Shi Qiang stood there, blowing out a mouthful of white smoke."
中国科幻基石丛书 94 11．大 史 大史在汪淼身边坐了下来， 将一把车钥匙递给他， “东单口儿上就 随便停车，我晚一步就让交警拖走了。 ” 大史啊，要知道你一直跟在我后面，我至少会有些安慰的。汪淼心 里说，但自尊使他没将这话说出口。他接过大史递过来的一枝烟，点上后， 抽了戒烟几年后的第一口。 “怎么样老弟，扛不住了吧？我说你不成吧，你还硬充六根脚指 头。” “你不会明白的。 ”汪淼猛抽几口烟说。 “我是太明白了……那好，去吃饭吧。 ” “我不想吃。 ” “那去喝酒，我请你！ ” 汪淼于是上了大史的车，开到附近一家小饭店，天还早，店里没什 么人。 “二斤爆肚，一瓶二锅头！ ”大史喊道，头也不抬，显然对这儿很熟 了。 看到端上来的两大盘黑乎乎的东西，汪淼空空的胃翻腾起来，差点 吐出来。大史又给他要豆浆和油条，汪淼强迫自己吃了点儿，然后和大 史一杯接一杯地喝了起来。他感觉自己轻飘飘的，话也多了起来，将这 三天的事情全部向大史说了，虽然他清楚，大史可能都知道，甚至知道 的比他还多。 “你是说，宇宙在冲你眨巴眼儿？”大史像吃面条似的吞下半盘爆 地球往事 三体 95 肚，抬头问。 “这比喻很到位。 ” “扯淡。 ” “你的无畏来源于无知。 ” “还是扯淡，来，干！ ” 汪淼干了这杯后，感觉世界围绕着自己旋转，只有对面吃爆肚的大 史很稳定，他说： “大史啊，你考虑过一些终极的哲学问题吗？哦， 比如说，人类从哪里来，要到哪里去；宇宙从哪里来，要到哪里去之类 的。 ” “没有。 ” “从来没有？ ” “从来没有。 ” “你总看到过星空吧，难道没有产生过一点敬畏和好奇？ ” “我夜里从不看天。 ” “怎么可能呢？你们不是常上夜班吗？ ” “老弟，我夜里蹲点时要是仰头看天，那监视对象溜了怎么办？ ” “我们真没的谈，干！ ” “其实啊，我就是看天上的星星也不会去想你那些终极哲学，我要 操心的事儿多着呢，要供房子，孩子还要上大学，更不要提那没完没了 的案子……我是个一眼能从嘴巴看到屁眼的直肠子，自然讨不得领导 欢心，退伍后混了多少年还是这么个熊样儿，要不是能干活，早让人踹 出去了……这些还不够我想的，我还有心思看星星想哲学？ ” “那倒也是，来，干！ ” “不过啊，我倒还真发明了一条终极定理。 ” “说说。 ” “邪乎到家必有鬼。 ” “你这是……什么狗屁定理！ ” “我说的‘有鬼’是指没有鬼，是有人在捣鬼。 ” 中国科幻基石丛书 96 “如果你有些起码的科学常识，就无法想象是怎样的力量才能做 成这两件事，特别是后一件，在整个宇宙的尺度上，不但用人类现有的科 学无法解释，甚至在科学之外我都无法想象。这连超自然都不是，我都 不知道是超什么了……” “还是那句话：扯淡！邪乎事儿我见多了。 ” “那你给个建议，下一步我该怎么办？ ” “继续喝，喝完了睡觉。 ” …… 汪淼不知道自己是怎么回到自己的车上，躺在后座上陷入了无梦的 沉睡，感觉时间并不长，但睁开眼睛后，看到太阳已在城市的西边快 要落下去了。他走下车，虽然早上喝的酒让他浑身发软，但感觉好多 了。他看到，自己正在紫禁城的一角，夕阳照在古老的皇宫上，在护城 河中泛起碎金，在他眼中，世界又恢复了古典和稳定。汪淼就这样享受 着久违的宁静，直到天色暗下来，那辆他熟悉的黑色桑塔纳从街道上的 车流中钻出来，径直开过来刹住，大史走了下来。 “睡好了？ ”大史瓮声瓮气地问。 “是，下一步该怎么办？ ” “谁，你吗？去吃晚饭，再喝点儿，喝完接着睡。 ” “然后呢？ ” “然后？明天你总得去上班吧。 ” “倒计时已减到…… 1091 小时了。 ” “去他妈的倒计时，你现在首先要保证站直了别趴下，然后才能说 别的。 ” “大史，你就不能告诉我一些真相吗？就算我求你了。 ” 大史盯着汪淼看了一会儿， 然后仰天一笑， “这话我也对常伟思说 过几次，咱俩是难兄难弟。实话告诉你，我他妈的什么也不知道，级别 低，他们不告诉我，有时真像在做噩梦。 ” “可你知道的总比我多。 ” 地球往事 三体 97 “那好， 我现在就把多出来的都告诉你。 ” 大史指了指护城河的河 沿，两人在那里找了个地方坐下来。天已经黑了下来，身后是车灯的河 流，他们看着自己的影子在河面上长长短短地变幻着。 “干我们这行的，其实就是把好多看上去不相关的事串联起来，串 对了，真相就出来了。前一阵发生过好多事儿，针对科研机构和学术界 的犯罪急剧增多，这是从未有过的事儿。你当然知道良湘加速器工地的 那起爆炸案，还有那名获诺贝尔奖的学者被杀的案子……犯罪的动机 都很怪，不为钱，不为报复，也没什么政治背景，单纯地搞破坏。还有其 他一些犯罪之外的事，比如‘科学边界’和那些学者的自杀等等。环保 分子最近的活动也过分活跃，一会儿在工地集会阻止水库和核电站的 建设，一会儿又搞什么回归自然的试验社会……还有其他一些看上去 是鸡毛蒜皮的事儿你最近看电影吗？ ” “基本不看。 ” “最近的几部大片，全土的掉渣，上面青山绿水的，不知哪个年代 的帅哥靓妹在里面男耕女织过得挺舒服，用导演的话说，是表现被科技 强奸之前的美好生活。比如那部《桃花源》 ，明摆着拍出来没人看，可就 有人硬把几个亿砸进去。还有一个科幻小说征文大赛，最高奖五百万， 谁把未来写的最恶心谁就能得奖，然后又砸进去几个亿把那几篇小说 拍成电影……奇奇怪怪的邪教也都冒出来，每一个教主都财大气粗 ……” “这些与你前面说的有什么关系？ ” “得把它们串起来看，当然我以前用不着操这份闲心，但从重案组 调到作战中心后，这就是我份内的事儿了。我能把它们串起来，这就是 我的天分，连常伟思也不得不服。 ” “得出的结论呢？ ” “所有这一切，都有且只有一个后台，它想把科学研究彻底搞垮。 ” “谁？ ” “不知道，真的不知道，但能感觉到它的计划，很气派很全面的一 中国科幻基石丛书 98 个计划：破坏科研设施，杀害科学家；或让你们自杀，让你们发疯……但 主要还是让你们往歪处想，这样你们就变得比一般人还蠢。 ” “你最后这句真精辟！ ” “同时，还要在社会上把科学搞臭，当然以前也一直有人干这个， 但这次绝对是有组织的。 ” “我相信你说的。 ” “哼，也就是现在吧。你们这些科学精英都看不出来的事，居然被 我这个专科毕业的大老粗看出来了？我说出这个想法后，没少被领导和 学者们笑话。 ” “就是当时你对我说的这些，我也肯定不会笑话你。你知道一些伪科 学的事吧，知道那些搞伪科学的最怕什么人吗？ ” “科学家呗。 ” “错了，世界上有许多一流学者被伪科学骗得团团转，最后还为之 摇旗呐喊。但伪科学最怕另一种人，他们很难被骗：魔术师。事实上，大 量的伪科学骗局，都是被魔术师揭穿的。比起科学界的书呆子来，你多 年的警务和社会经验显然更有能力觉察这种大规模犯罪。 ” “其实比我聪明的人还是有的，这种事早就被上面觉察了，我开始 时还被笑话是没找对地方，再后来就被老连长招到了这儿，不过也只是 干些跑腿的事儿……好了，这就是我比你多知道的那点儿。 ” “有个疑问：这些与军方有什么关系呢？ ” “我也纳闷，问他们，他们就说战争爆发了，战争当然是军队的事 儿。我和你一样，开始以为他们是在说梦话。可他们真没开玩笑，现在部 队确实处于临战状态。我们这样的作战中心，在全球有二十多个，上面 还有一级，但谁都不知道是什么。 ” “敌人是谁？ ” “不知道。北约军官进驻总参的作战室了，五角大楼里也有一大帮 子解放军，谁他妈知道谁是敌人？ ” “这也太离奇了，你说得这都是真的？ ！ ” 地球往事 三体 99 “我在部队的好几个老战友现在都混成将军了，所以知道一些。 ” “这么大的事，新闻媒体居然没有一点儿反应？ ” “这又是一个了不得的现象：所有国家同时保密，而且做的这么严 实。我现在可以肯定一点：敌人是个狠角色，上面害怕了！我太熟悉常伟 思了，从他那里就能看出来，他是天塌下来都不怕的人，但现在塌下来 的可能不止是天了。他们被吓得够呛，他们根本没有信心战胜那个敌 人。” “要这样，那太可怕了。 ” “不过谁都有怕的东西，那个狠角色也有；越厉害的角色，它怕的 东西对它就越致命。 ” “那它怕什么？ ” “怕你们，怕科学家。而且奇怪的是，你们研究的东西越是没有实 际用处，越是天马行空不着边际，像杨冬那号的，它就越怕，比你怕宇宙 眨眼更怕，所以才出手这么狠。要是杀你们有用，它早就把你们杀光了， 但最有效的办法还是扰乱你们的思想，人死了还会有别人，但思想乱 了，科学就完了。 ” “你是说它怕基础科学？ ” “是，基础科学。 ” “我和杨冬的研究差别很大，纳米材料不是基础科学，只是一个高 强度材料，能威胁到那种力量？ ！ ” “你还真是个特例，像你这种搞应用研究的，它现在一般还不打 扰，也许你那些材料中真有让它怕的东西。 ” “那我该怎么办？ ” “去上班，研究下去，这就是对它最大的打击，别管什么鸡巴倒计 时。如果下了班想放松，也可以玩玩那个游戏，能打通它最好。 ” “游戏？《三体》？难道它与这些也有关系？ ！ ” “有关系，我看作战中心的好几个专家也在玩儿，那玩意儿不是一 般的游戏，我这样无知无畏的人玩不了，还真得你这样有知识的才 中国科幻基石丛书 100 行。” “哦，没别的了？ ” “没了，有的时候我再告诉你，手机要一直开着。老弟，可得站直 ！害怕的时候就想想我那条终极定理。 ” 汪淼连谢谢都没来得及说，大史就上车走了。,"1 0 D a S h i Shi sat down ne xt to W ang and handed him his car keys. “Y ou parked right at the intersection at Dongdan. If I had arrived just a minute later , the traf fic cops would have had it towed.” Da Shi, if I had known you w er e following me, I would have been comforted, W ang thought, switching to Shi Qiang’ s familiar nickname in his mind, though self-respect made him hold back the words. He accepted a cigarette from Da Shi, lit it, and took his first drag since he quit several years ago. “So how’ s it goi ng, buddy? Finding it hard to bear? I said you couldn’ t handle it. And you insisted on playing the tough guy .” “Y ou wouldn’ t understand.” W ang took several more deep puf fs. “Y our problem is, you understand too well.… Fine, let’ s go grab a bite.” “I’m not hungry .” “Then we’ll go drinking! My treat.” W ang go t into Da Shi’ s car and they drove to a small restaurant nearby . It was still early , and the place was deserted. “T wo or ders of quick-fried tripe , and a bottle of er guo tou !”22 Da Shi shouted, without even looking up. He was obviously a regular here. As he stared at the two plates f illed with black slices of tripe, W ang’ s empty stomach began to churn, and he thought he was going to be sick. Da Shi ordered him some warm soy milk and fried pancakes, and W ang forced himself to eat some.Then the y drank shots of er guo tou . He beg an to feel lightheaded, and his tongue loosened. Gradually , he recounted the events of the last three days to Da Shi, even though he knew that Da Shi probably knew everything alreadymaybe Da Shi even knew more than he did. “Y ou’re saying that the universe was … winking at you?” Da Sh i asked, as he slurped down strips of tripe like noodles. “That’ s a very appropriate metaphor .” “Bullshit.” “Y our lack of fear is based on your ignorance.” “More bullshit. Come, drink!” W ang finished another shot. No w the world was spinning arou nd him, and only the tri pe-chomping Shi Qiang across from him remained stable. He said , “Da Shi, have yo u ever … considered certain ultimate philosophical qu estions? For example, where does Man come fr om? Where does M an go? Where does the universe come from? Wher e does the universe go? Et cetera.” “Nope.” “Never?” “Never .” “Y ou must see the stars. Aren’ t you awed and curious?” “I never look at the sky at night.” “How is that possible? I thought you often worked the night shift?” “Buddy , when I work at night, if I look up at the sky , the suspect is going to escape.” “W e really have nothing to say to each other . All right. Drink!” “T o be honest, even if I were to look at the stars in the sky , I wouldn’ t be think ing about your philosophical questions. I have too mu ch to worry about! I gotta pay the mortgage , save for the kid’ s college, and handle the endless stream of cases.… I’m a simple man without a lot of complicated twists and turns. Look down my throat and you can see o ut my ass. Naturally , I don’ t know how to make my bosses like me. Y ears after being dischar ged from the army , my career is going nowhere. If I weren’ t pretty good at my job, I would have been kicked out a long time ago.… Y ou think that’ s no t enoug h for me to worry about? Y ou think I’ve got the ener gy to gaze at stars and philosophize?” “Y ou’re right. All right, drink up!”“But, I did indeed invent an ultimate rule.” “T ell me.” “Anything suf ficiently weird must be fishy .” “What … what kind of crappy rule is that?” “I’m saying that there’ s always someone behind things that don’ t seem to have an explanation.” “If you had even basic kno wledge of science, you’d know it’ s impossible for any force to acco mplish the things I experienced. Especially that last one. T o manipulate things at the scale of the univers enot only can you not explain it with our current science, I couldn’ t even imagine how to expla in it outside of science. It’ s more than supernatural. It’ s super -I- don’ t-know-what.…” “I’m telling you, that’ s bullshit. I’ve seen plenty of weird things.” “Then tell me what I should do next.” “Keep on drinking. And then sleep.” “Fine.” * * * W ang Miao had no idea how he got back into his car . He tumb led into the backseat and fell into a dreamless slumber . He didn’ t think that he was asleep fo r long, but when he op ened his eyes, the sun was already near the horizon in the west. He got out of the car . Even tho ugh the alcohol that morning had made him wea k, he did feel better . He saw that he was at one co rner of the Forbidden City . The setting sun shone on the ancient palace and turned into bright g old ripp les in the moat. In his eyes, the world became once again classical and stable. W ang sa t until it got dark, enj oying the peace that had been missing from his life. The black V olkswagen Santana that he was now so familiar with pulled out of the traf fic st reaming through the street and braked to a stop right in front of him. Shi Qiang got out of the car . “Slept well?” Da Shi growled. “Y es. What next?” “Who? Y ou? Go have dinner . Then drink a little more. Then sleep again.”“Then what?” “Then? Don’ t you have to go to work tomorrow?” “But the countdown … there’ s only 1,091 hours left.” “Fuck the countdown. Y our first priority right now is to make sure you can stand straight and not collapse into a heap. Then we can talk about other things.” “Da Shi, can you tell me something about what’ s really going on? I’m begging you.” Da Shi stared at W ang a while . Then he laughed. “I’ve said the very same thing to General Chang several times. W e’re in the same boat, you and I. I’ll be honest: I know fucking shit. My pay grade is too low , and they tell me nothing. Sometimes I think this is a nightmare.” “But you must know more than I.” “Fine. I’ ll tell you what little I k now .” Da Shi pointed to the shore of the moat around the Forbidden City . The two found a spot and sat down. It wa s no w nigh t, and traf fic flow ed ceaselessly behind them like a river . They watched their shadows lengthening and shortening over the moat. “In my line of work, it’ s all about putting together many ap parently unconnected things. When you piece them together the right w ay , you get the truth. For a while now , strange things have been happening. “For example, there’ s been an unprecedented wave of crimes against academia and science research institutions. Of course you know about the explosion at the Liangxiang accelerator construction site. The re was also the m urder of that Nobel laureate … the crimes were all unus ual: not for money , not for revenge. No political background, just pure destruction. “Other s trange t hings didn’ t involve crimes. For example, the F rontiers of Scien ce and the suicides of those academics. Environmental activists have also become extra bold: protest mobs at construction s ites to stop nuclear power plants and hydroelectric dams, experimental c ommunities ‘returning to nature,’ and other apparently trivial matters.… Do you go to the movies?” “No, not really .” “Recent big-budget films all have rustic themes. The setting is always green mountains and clear water , with handsome men and pretty women of some indeterminate era living in harmony with nature. T o use the words of the dire ctors, they ‘represent the beautiful life before science spoilednature.’ T ake Peach Blossom Spring : it’ s clearly the sort of film that no one wants to see. But they spent hundreds of millions to make it. The re was also this scie nce ficti on contest with a top reward of five million for the person who imagined the most disgusti ng possible future. They spent another few hundred million to turn the winning stories into movies. And then you’ve got all these strange cults poppi ng up everywhere, where every cult leader seems to have a lot of money .…” “What does that last bit have to do with everything you mentioned before?” “Y ou have to c onnect all the dots. Of course I didn’ t need to busy myself w ith such concerns before, but after I was transferred from the crime unit to the Battle Command Center , it became part of my job. Even General Chang is impressed by my talent for connecting the dots.” “And your conclusion?” “Everything that’ s happening is coordinated by someone behind the scenes with one goal: to completely ruin scientific research.” “Who?” “I have no idea. But I can sense the plan, a very comprehensive, intricate plan: damage scientific research installations, kill scientists, drive scientists like you crazy and make you commit suicidebut th e main goal is to misdirect y our thoughts until you’re even more foolish than ordinary people.” “Y our last statement is really perceptive.” “At the same time, they want to ruin science’ s reputation in society . Of course some people have always engaged in anti-science activities, but now it’ s coordinated.” “I believe it.” “ Now you believe me. So many of you scientific elites couldn’ t figure it out, and I, having gone only to vocational school, had the answer? Ha! After I explained my theory , the scholars and my bosses all ridiculed it.” “If you had told me your theor y back then, I’m sure I wouldn’ t have laughed at you. T ake those fra uds who practice pseudosciencedo you know who they’re most afraid of?” “Scientists, of course.” “No. M any of the best scientists can be fooled by pseudoscience and sometimes devote their lives to it. But pseudoscience is af raid of oneparticular type of people who ar e very hard to fool: stage magicians. In fact, many pseudoscientific hoaxes were exposed by stage magicians. Compared to the bookworms of the scientific world, your experience as a cop makes you far more likely to perceive such a lar ge-scale conspiracy .” “W ell, th ere’re plenty of people smarter than me. People in positions of power are well aware of the plot. When they ridiculed me at first, it was only because I wasn’ t explaining my theory to the right people. Later on, my old compan y commanderGeneral Changhad me transferred. But I’m still not doing anything oth er than running errands.… That’ s it. Now you know as much as I do.” “Another question: What does this have to do with the military?” “I was baf fled, too. I asked them , and they said that now that t here’ s a war , of course th e military would be involved. I was like you, t hinking that they wer e talkin g nonsense. But no, they weren’ t joking. The army really is on high alert. T here are twenty-some Battle Command Centers like ours around the globe. And above them there’ s another level o f command structure. But no one knows the details.” “Who’ s the enemy?” “No idea. NA T O of ficers are no w stationed in the war room of the PLA General Staf f Department, and a bunch of PLA of ficers are working out of the Pentagon. Who the fuck knows who we’re fighting?” “This is all so bizarre. Are you sure it’ s all true?” “A bunc h of my old buddies fro m the army are now generals, so I know a few things.” “The media has no idea about any of this?” “Ah, that’ s another thing. All the countries are keeping a tight lid on this, and they’ve been successful so far . I can guarantee you that the enemy is incred ibly pow erful. Those in char ge are terrified! I know General Chang very we ll. He’ s the sort who’ s afraid of nothing, not even the sky falling, but I can tell th at he’ s worried about something much worse right now . They’re all scared out of their wits, and they have no confidence that we’ll win.” “If what you say is true, then we should all be frightened.” “Everyone is afraid of something. The enemy must be, too. The more powerful they are, the more they have to lose to their fears.” “What do you think the enemy is afraid of?”“Y ou! S cientists! The odd thing is that the less practical your research is, the more they’re afraid of youlike abstract theories, the kind of thing Y ang Dong worked on. They are more frightened of such work than you are of the universe winking at you. That’ s why they’re so ruthless. If killing you would so lve the problem, you’d all be dead by now . But the most ef fective technique remains disrupting yo ur thoughts. When a scientist dies, another will take his place. But if his thoughts are confused, then science is over .” “Y ou’re saying they’re afraid of fundamental science?” “Y es, fundamental science.” “But my research is very dif fe rent in nature from Y ang Don g’ s. The nanomaterial I work on isn’ t fu ndamental science. It’ s just a very strong material. What’ s the threat to them?” “Y ou’re a special case. Usuall y , they don’ t bother those eng aged in applied research. Maybe the material you’re developing really scares them.” “Then what should I do?” “Go to work an d keep up your research. That’ s the best way to strike back at them. Don’ t worry abou t that shitty countdown. If you want to relax a bit after work, play that game. If you can beat it, that might help.” “That game? Thr ee Body ? Y ou think it’ s connected to all this?” “Definitely connected. I know that several specialists at the Battle Command Center are playing it, too. It’ s no ordinary game. Someone like me, fearless out of ignorance, can’ t play it. It has to be someone knowledgeable like you.” “Anything else?” “No. Bu t if I find out more I’ll let you know . Keep your ph one on, buddy . K eep your head screwed on straight, and if you get scare d again, just remember my ultimate rule.” Da Shi drove away before W ang had a chance to thank him."
地球往事 三体 101 12．三体、墨子、烈焰 汪淼回到家里，之前没有忘记在游戏店买了一套 V装具。妻子告 诉他，单位的人一天都在找他。汪淼打开已关了一天的手机回了几个纳 米中心来的电话，许诺明天去上班。吃饭的时候，他真的照大史说的又 喝了不少酒，但毫无睡意。当妻儿睡熟后，他坐在电脑前戴上新买回的 V装具，再次登录《三体》 。 黎明的荒原，汪淼站在纣王的金字塔前，覆盖它的积雪早已消失， 构筑金字塔的大石块表面被风化得坑坑洼洼，大地已是另一种颜色。远 处有几幢巨大的建筑物，汪淼猜那都是干仓，但形状与上次所见已完全 不同，一切都表明，漫长的岁月已经流逝。 借着天边的晨曦，汪淼寻找着金字塔的入口，在那个位置，他看到 入口已经被石块封死了，但同时看到旁边新修了一条长长的石阶，直通 金字塔的顶部。他仰望高高的塔顶，看到原来那直指苍穹的塔顶已被削 平了，成为一个平台，这座金字塔也由埃及式变为阿兹特克式。 沿着石阶，汪淼攀上了金字塔的顶部，看到了一处类似于古观星台 的地方。平台的一角有一架数米高的天文望远镜，旁边还有几架较小型 的。另一边是几台奇形怪状的仪器，很像古中国的浑天仪。最引人注目 的是平台中央的一个大铜球，直径两米左右，放置在一台复杂的机器 上，由许多大小不同的齿轮托举着，缓缓转动。汪淼注意到，它的转动方 向和速度在不停地变化。在机器下方有一个方坑，在里面昏暗的火光 中，汪淼看到几个奴隶模样的人在推动着一个转盘，为上面的机器提供 中国科幻基石丛书 102 动力。 有一个人朝汪淼走来，与上次首遇周文王时一样，这人背对着地平 线的曙光，只能看到黑暗中一双闪亮的眼睛。他身材瘦高，身着飘逸的 黑色长袍，长发在头顶上不经意地绾了个结，剩下的在风中飞扬。 “你好，我是墨子。 ”他自我介绍道。 “我是海人，你好。 ” “啊，我知道你！ ”墨子兴奋地说， “在 137号文明中，你追随过周 文王。 ” “我是同他一起到过这里，但从不相信他的理论。 ” “你是对的。 ”墨子对汪淼郑重地点点头，然后凑近他说， “知道 吗，在你离开的三十六万两千年里，文明又重新启动了四次。在乱纪元 和恒纪元的无规律交替中艰难地成长。最短的一次只走完了石器时代 的一半，但 139号文明创造了纪录，居然走到了蒸汽时代！ ” “这么说，在那个文明中有人找到了太阳运行的规律？” 墨子大笑着摇头： “没有没有，侥幸而已。 ” “但人们一直在努力吧？ ” “当然，来，我让你看看上次文明的努力。 ”墨子领着汪淼走到观星 台一角，大地在他们下面伸展开来，像一块沧桑的旧皮革，墨子将一架 小望远镜对准下面大地上的一个目标，然后让汪淼看。汪淼将眼睛凑到 目镜上，看到一个奇异的东西，那是一具骷髅，在晨光中呈雪白色，看上 去结构很精致。最令人惊奇的是这骷髅站立着，那姿势很是优雅高贵， 一只手抬到颚下，似乎在抚摸着那已不存在的胡须，它的头微仰，仿佛 在向天地发问。 “那是孔子。 ”墨子指着那个方向说， “他认为，一切都要合乎礼， 宇宙万物都不例外。他于是创造了一套宇宙的礼法系统，企图据此预测 太阳的运行。 ” “结果可想而知。 ” “是的，他计算出太阳该循礼之时，就预测了一次长达五年的恒纪 地球往事 三体 103 元，你别说。那一次还真持续了一个月之久。 ” “然后，有一天太阳再也没有出来？ ” “不，那天太阳出来了，升到了正空，但突然熄灭了。 ” “什么？熄灭？ ！ ” “是的，开始是慢慢暗下去、小下去，然后突然熄灭了！夜幕降临， 那个冷啊，孔子就那么站着冻成了冰柱，一直站到现在。 ” “什么都没有了吗？我是说熄灭后的太阳？ ” “在那个位置，出现了一颗飞星，像是太阳死后的灵魂。 ” “哦，你肯定太阳是突然熄灭，飞星是突然出现的吗？ ” “是。突然熄灭，飞星就出现了。你可以去查日志数据库，这记载没 错。 ” “哦 ”汪淼沉吟良久，本来，对于三体世界的奥秘，他心中已 经有了一个模糊的理论，但墨子说的这件事将他所想的全推翻了， “怎么 会是……突然的呢？ ”他懊恼地说。 “现在是汉朝，西汉还是东汉我也不清楚。 ” “你也是一直活到现在？ ” “我有使命，要准确观测太阳的运行。那些巫师、玄学家和道学家 们都是些无用的东西，他们四体不勤、五谷不分，动手能力极差，只是沉 浸于自己的玄想中。但我不同，我能做出实际的东西来！ ”他指指平台 上的众多仪器说。 “凭着这些就能达到你的目的吗？”汪淼指了指仪器，特别是那个 神秘的大铜球说。 “我也有理论，但不是玄学，是通过大量观测总结出来的。首先，你 知道宇宙是什么吗？是一部机器。 ” “这等于没说。 ” “说得具体些，宇宙是一个悬浮于火海中的大空心球，球上有许多 小洞和一个大洞，火海的光芒从这些洞中透进来，小洞是星星，大洞是 太阳。 ” 中国科幻基石丛书 地球 往事 三体 中国科幻基石丛书 106 “很有意思的一个模型， ”汪淼看看大铜球说，现在他大概能猜出 那是什么了， “但其中有一个大漏洞：太阳升起和落下时，我们看到它 与群星是相对运动的，而大球球壳上的所有洞孔的相对位置应该是固 定的。” “很对。所以我推出了经过修正的模型，宇宙之球是由两层球壳构 成的，我们看到的天空是内层壳，外层球壳上有一个大洞，内层球壳上 有大量小洞，那个外壳上的大洞透进的光在两层球壳之间的夹层反射 和散射，使夹层间充满了亮光，这亮光从小洞中透进来，我们就看到了 星星。” “那太阳呢？” “太阳是外层壳上的大洞投射到内层壳上的巨大光斑，它的亮度 如此之高。像照穿鸡蛋壳一般照穿了内壳，我们就看到了太阳。光斑周 围的散射光较强，也照了内壳，这就是我们白天看到的晴空。 ” “是什么力量驱动着两层球壳进行不规则转动呢？ ” “是宇宙之外火海的力量。 ” “可不同时期的太阳大小和亮度是不一样的。在你的双壳模型中， 太阳的大小和亮度应该是恒定的，如果外界火海不均匀，至少大小应该 是恒定的。 ” “你把这个模型想得太简单了，随着外界火海的变化，宇宙的外层 壳的大小也会膨胀或收缩，这就导致了太阳大小和光度的变化。 ” “那飞星呢？ ” “飞星？你怎么总是提飞星？它们是些不重要的东西，是宇宙球内 乱飞的灰尘。 ” “不。我认为飞星很重要。另外，你的模型如何解释孔子时代太阳 当空熄灭呢？ ” “那是个罕见的例外，可能是宇宙外面的火海中的一个暗斑或黑 云正好飘过外层壳上的大洞。 ” 汪淼指指大铜球问： “这一定就是你的宇宙模型吧？ ” 地球往事 三体 107 “是的，我造出了宇宙机器。使球转动的那一组复杂的齿轮，模拟 着外界火海对球的作用。这种作用的规律，也就是外界火海中火焰的分 布和流动规律，是我经过几百年的观测总结出来的。 ” “这球可以膨胀收缩吗？ ” “当然可以，现在它就在缓慢收缩。 ” 汪淼找了平台边的栏杆作为固定参照物细看，发现墨子说的是事 实。 “这球有内层壳吗？ ” “当然有，内外壳之间通过复杂的机构传动。 ” “真是精巧的机械！ ”汪淼由衷地赞叹道， “可从外壳上没有看到 在内层壳投射光斑的大洞啊？ ” “没有洞，我在外壳的内壁上安装了一个光源，作为大洞的模拟。 那光源是用从几十万只萤火虫中提炼出来的荧光材料制成的。发出的 是冷光，因为内壳的半透明石膏球层导热性不好，这样可以避免一般的 热光源在球内聚集温度，让记录员可以在里面长期待下去。 ” “球里面还有人？ ” “当然，记录员站在一个底部有滑轮的架子上，位置保持在球体中 心。将模拟宇宙设定到现实宇宙的某一状态后，它其后的运转将准确地 模拟出未来的宇宙状态，当然也能模拟出太阳的运行状态，那名记录员 将其记录下来就形成了一本准确的万年历，这是过去上百个文明梦寐 以求的东西啊。你来得正好，模拟宇宙刚刚显示，一个长达四年的恒纪 元将开始，汉武帝已根据我的预测发布了浸泡诏书，让我们等着日出 吧。” 墨子调出了游戏界面，将时间的流逝速度稍微调快了些。一轮红日 升出地平线，大地上星罗棋布的湖泊开始解冻，这些湖泊原来封冻的冰 面上落满了沙尘，与大地融为一体，现在渐渐变成一个个晶莹闪亮的镜 面，仿佛大地睁开了无数只眼睛。在这高处，浸泡的具体细节看不清楚， 只能看到湖边的人渐渐多了起来，像春天拥出洞穴的蚁群。世界再一次 中国科幻基石丛书 108 复活了。 “您不下去投身于这美妙的生活吗？刚刚复活的女性是最渴望爱 情的。 ”墨子指着下面重现生机的大地对汪淼说， “你在这里再待下去 没有意义了，游戏已经终结，我是最后的胜者。 ” “你的模拟宇宙作为一台机器确实精妙绝伦，但对它做出的预测 嘛……哦，我能否使用您那台望远镜观测天象呢？” “当然可以，你请。 ”墨子对着大望远镜做了个手势。 汪淼走到望远镜前，立刻发现了问题： “要观测太阳，怎么办呢？ ” 墨子从一只木箱中拿出了一块黑色圆片， “加上这片烟熏的滤 镜。”说着将它插到望远镜的目镜前。 汪淼将望远镜对准已升到半空的太阳，不由赞叹墨子的想象力：太 阳看上去确实像一个通向无边火海的孔洞，是一个更大存在的一小部 分。但进一步细看时，他发现，这个太阳与自己现实经验中的那个有些 不同，它有一颗很小的核心，如果将太阳看成一只眸子，这个日核就像 瞳孔。日核虽小，但明亮而致密，包裹它的外层则显得有些缺少实在感， 飘忽不定，很像是气态的。而穿过那厚厚的外层能看到内部日核，也说 明外层是处于透明或半透明状态的，它发出的光芒，更多的可能是日核 光芒的散射。 太阳图像的真实和精致令汪淼震惊，他再次确定，游戏的作者在表 面简洁的图像深处有意隐藏了海量的细节，等待着玩家去发掘。 汪淼直起身，细想着这个太阳的结构隐含的意义，立刻兴奋起来。 由于游戏时间加速，太阳已移到了西天，汪淼调整望远镜再次对准它， 一直跟踪到它落下地平线。夜幕降临。大地上点点篝火与夜空渐密的群 星相映。汪淼将望远镜上的黑色滤镜取下，继续观测星空，他最感兴趣 的是飞星，很快找到了两个。他只来得及对其中的一个进行大概的观 察，天就又亮了。他于是装上滤镜接着观测太阳……汪淼就这样连续进 行了十多天的天文观测，享受着发现的乐趣。其实，时间流逝速度的加 快是有利于天文观测的。因为这使得天体的运行和变化更加明显。 地球往事 三体 109 恒纪元开始后的第十七天，日出时间已过了五个小时，大地仍笼罩 在夜幕中。金字塔下面人山人海。无数火把在寒风中摇曳。 “太阳可能不会出来了，同 137号文明的结局一样。 ”汪淼对正在 编纂这个世界上第一份万年历的墨子说。 墨子抚着胡须，对汪淼露出自信的笑容， “放心，太阳就要升起，恒 纪元将继续，我已经掌握了宇宙机器的运转原理，我的预测不会有 错。” 似乎是印证墨子的话，天边真的出现了曙光，金字塔旁边的人群中 爆发出一阵欢呼声。 那片银白色的曙光以超乎寻常的速度扩展变亮，仿佛即将升起的 太阳要弥补失去的时间。很快，曙光已弥漫了半个天空，以至太阳还未 升起。大地已同往日的白昼一样明亮。汪淼向曙光出现的远方看去，发 现地平线发出刺眼的强光，并向上弯曲拱起，成一个横贯视野的完美弧 形，他很快看出那不是地平线，是日轮的边缘，正在升起的是一颗硕大 无比的太阳，眼睛适应了这强光后，地平线仍在原位显现出来，汪淼看 到一缕缕黑色的东西在天边升起，在日轮明亮的背景上格外清晰，那是 远方燃烧产生的烟雾。金字塔下面，一匹快马从日出方向飞驰而来，扬 起的尘埃在大地上划出一道清晰的灰线，人群为其让开了一条路，汪淼 听到马上的人在声嘶力竭地大喊： “脱水！脱水！ ！ ” 跟着这匹马跑来的，是一大群牛马和其他动物。它们的身上都带着 火焰，在大地上织成一张移动的火毯。 巨日已从地平线上升起了一半，占据了半个天空，大地似乎正顺着 一堵光辉灿烂的大墙缓缓下沉。汪淼可以清晰地看到太阳表面的细节， 火焰的海洋上布满涌浪和旋涡，黑子如幽灵般沿着无规则的路线漂浮， 日冕像金色的长袖懒洋洋地舒展着。 大地上，已脱水和未脱水的人都燃烧起来，像无数扔进炉膛的柴 火，其火焰的光芒比炉膛中燃烧的炭块都亮，但很快就熄灭了。 中国科幻基石丛书 110 巨日迅速上升，很快升到了正空，遮盖了大部分天空。汪淼仰头看 去，感觉突然间发生了奇妙的变化：这之前他是在向上看，现在似乎是 在向下看了。巨日的表面构成了火焰的大地。他感觉自己正向这灿烂的 地狱坠落！ 大地上的湖泊开始蒸发，一团团雪白的水蒸汽成蘑菇云状高高升 起，接着弥散开来，遮盖了湖边人类的骨灰。 “恒纪元将继续，宇宙是一台机器，我造出了这台机器；恒纪元将 继续，宇宙是……” 汪淼扭头一看，这声音是从正在燃烧的墨子发出来的，他的身体包 含在一根高高的橘黄色火柱之中，皮肤在发皱和炭化，但双眼仍发出与 吞噬他的火焰完全不同的光芒。他那已成为燃烧的炭杆的双手捧着一 团正在飞散的绢灰，那是第一份万年历。汪淼自己也在燃烧，他举起双 手，看到了两根火炬。 巨日很快向西移去，让出被它遮住的苍穹。沉没于地平线下，下沉 的过程很快，大地似乎又沿着那堵光墙升起。耀眼的晚霞转瞬即逝，夜 幕像被一双巨手拉扯的大黑布般遮盖了已化为灰烬的世界。刚刚被烧 灼过的大地在夜色下发着暗红色的光，像一块从炉中夹出来不久的炭 块。汪淼在夜空中看到群星出现了一小会儿，很快，水汽和烟雾遮住了 天空，也遮住了处于红炽状态的大地上的一切，世界陷入一片黑暗的混 沌之中。一行红色的字出现： 第141号文明在烈焰中毁灭了，该文明进化至东汉层次。 文明的种子仍在，她将重新启动，再次开始在三体世界中命运莫测 地进化，欢迎您再次登录。 汪淼摘下 V装具，精神上的震撼稍稍平息后，又一次有了那种感 觉：《三体》是故意伪装成虚假，但拥有巨大纵深的真实；而眼前的真实 世界，倒像一幅看似繁复庞杂实则单薄表浅的《清明上河图》 。 地球往事 三体 111 第二天汪淼去纳米中心上班，除了因他昨天没来导致的一些小小的 混乱外，一切如常。他发现工作是一种有效的麻醉剂，投身于其中，就 暂时躲开了那噩梦般的困扰。一整天他有意使自己保持忙碌状态，天黑 后才离开实验室。 一走出纳米中心的大楼，汪淼又被那噩梦的感觉追上了，他觉得布 满群星的夜空像一面覆盖一切的放大镜，他自己是镜下的一只赤裸的 小虫，无处躲藏。他必须再为自己找些事情做，想到应该再去看看杨冬 的母亲了，就驱车来到了叶文洁家。 杨母一个人在家，汪淼进去时她正坐在沙发上看书，他这才发现她 的眼睛既老花又近视，看书和看远处时都要换戴眼镜。杨母见到汪淼很 高兴，说他的气色看上去比上次好多了。 “都是因为您的人参。 ”汪淼笑笑说。 杨母摇摇头， “那东西成色不好，那时，在基地周围能采到很好的 野山参。我采到过一枝有这么长的……不知现在那里怎么样，听说已经 没有人了。唉，老了，最近总是在想以前的事。 ” “听说在‘文革’中，您吃过不少苦。 ” “听小沙说的吧？”杨母轻轻摆摆手，像拂去面前的一根蛛丝， “过 去了，都过去了……昨天小沙来电话，急匆匆的，说些什么我也听不明 白，只听出来你好像遇到什么事。小汪啊，其实，你到了我这个年纪，就 会发现当年以为天要塌下来的那些大事，其实没有什么的。 ” “谢谢您。 ”汪淼说，他又感到了那种难得的温暖。现在，眼前这位 历经沧桑变得平静淡泊的老人， 和那位无知而无畏的大史， 成了他摇摇欲 坠的精神世界的两根支柱。 杨母接着说： “说起‘文革’ ，我还是很幸运的，在活不下去的时 候，竟意外地到了一个能活下去的地方。 ” “您是说红岸基地吗？ ” 杨母点点头。 “那真是件不可思议的事情，我最初还以为纯属传说呢。 ” 中国科幻基石丛书 112 “不是传说，要是想知道，我给你讲讲自己经历过的那些事。 ” 杨母这一说令汪淼有些紧张。 “叶老师，我只是好奇而己，要是不 方便就算了。 ” “哦，没什么的，就当我找人说说话吧，我这阵子也确实想找人说 说话。 ” “您可以到老年活动室什么的去坐坐，多走动走动总是不寂寞。 ” “那些退休的老家伙们好多都是我在大学的同事，但总是同他们 融不到一块儿，大家都喜欢念念叨叨地回忆往事，但都希望别人听自己 的，而对别人说的都厌烦。红岸那些事，也就你感兴趣了。 ” “现在说总还是有些不方便吧？ ” “那倒是，毕竟还属于机密。不过那本书出了以后，许多亲历过的 人也都在说，都是公开的秘密了。写那本书的人很不负责任，他的目的 先放到一边，书中的许多内容也与事实有很大出入，纠正一下也是应该 的。 ” 于是，杨母向汪淼讲述了那段还未尘封的往事。,"1 1 T h r e e B o d y : M o z i a n d F i e r y F l a m e s W ang M iao retu rned home, stopping on the way to buy a V -suit. His wife told him that people from work had been trying to get ahold of him all day . W ang turned on his phone, che cked his messages, and returned a few calls. He promised he’d be at work tomorrow . At dinner , he followed Da Shi’ s advice and drank some more. But he didn’ t feel sleepy . After his wife went to bed, he sat in front of the computer , put on his new V -suit, and logged into Thr ee Body . * * * Desolate plain at dawn. W ang st ood in front of King Zh ou’ s pyramid. The snow that h ad once covered it was gone, and the blocks of stone were pockmarked by erosion. The gro und was now a dif ferent color . In the distance were a few massive buildings that W ang guessed were dehydratories, but they were of a dif ferent design than the ones he had seen last time. Everything told him that eons had passed. By t he f aint daw n light, W ang l ooked for the entrance. When h e found it, he saw that the opening had been sealed by blocks of stone. But next to it, th ere was now a staircase carved into the pyramid leading all the way to the apex. He lo oked up and s aw that the top had been flattened into a platform. The pyramid, once Egyptian in style, now resembled an Aztec one.W ang climbed up the stairs and reached the apex. The platform looked like an ancient astronomical o bservatory . In one corner was a telescope several meters high, and next to it were a few smaller telescopes . In another corner were a few strange instruments that reminded him of ancient Chinese armillary spheres, models of objects in the sky . His atten tion was drawn to the lar ge copper sphere in the cente r of the platform. T wo meters in diamet er , it was set on top of a complex machine. Propelled by countless gears, th e sphere slowly rotated. W ang noticed that the direc tion and speed of its rotation constantly shifted. Below the machine was a lar ge square cavity . By the faint torchlight within, W ang saw a few slavelike figures pushing a spoked, horizontal wheel, which provided the power to the machine above. A m an walked toward W ang. Like King W en when W ang had first encountered him, the man had his back against the sliver of light on the horizon, and he appeared to W a ng as a pair of bright eyes flo ating in the darkness. He was slender and ta ll, dressed in a flowing black robe, his hair carelessly knotted on top of his head with a few strands waving in the wind. “Hello,” the man said. “I’m Mozi.”23 “Hello, I’m Hairen.” “Ah, I know you!” Mozi grew excited. “Y ou were a follower of King W en back in Civilization Number 137.” “I did follow him here. But I never believed his theories.” “Y ou’re right.” Mozi nodded at W ang solemnly . Then he moved closer . “During the three hundred and s ixty-two thousand years you’ve been away , civilization has been reborn fou r more times. These civilizations struggled to de velop through the irregular alternation of Chaotic Eras and Stable Eras. The shortest-lived one got only halfway through the Stone Age, but Civilization Num ber 139 broke a record and developed all the way to the Steam Age.” “Y ou’re saying that people from that civilization found the laws governing the sun’ s motion?” Mozi laughed and shook his head. “Not at all. They were just lucky .” “But the ef fort to do so has never ceased?” “Of cou rse not. Come, let us see the ef forts of the last civil ization.” Mozi led W ang to a corner of the observatory platform. The ground spreadout beneath them like an ancient piece of leather . Mozi aimed one of the smaller telescopes at a tar get on the ground and gestured for W ang to look. W ang lo oked th rough the eyepiece and saw a strange sight: a skeleton. In the dawn light it gave of f a snow-white glint and appeared to be very refined. Astonishingly , the skeleton stoo d on its own. Its posture was graceful and eleg ant. One hand was held below the chin, as though stroking a long- missing beard. Its head tilted s lightly up, as though questioning sky and earth. “That’ s Confuci us,” Mozi said. “He believed that everything had to fit li, the Confucian conception of order and propriety , and nothi ng in the universe could be exempt from i t. He created a system of rites a nd hoped to predict the motion of the sun with it.” “I can imagine the result.” “Right y ou are. He calculated how the sun would follow the r ites, and predicted a five-year Stable Era. And you know what? There was indeed a Stable Era … lasting a month.” “And then one day the sun just didn’ t come out?” “No, the sun rose that day as well. It rose to the middle of the sky , and then went out.” “What? W ent out?” “Y es. It gradual ly dimmed, became smaller , and then went out all of a sudden. Night fell. Oh, the cold. Confucius stood there and froze into a column of ice. And there he remains.” “W as there anything remaining in the sky after the sun went out?” “A flying star ap peared in that location, like a soul left behind after the sun died.” “Y ou’re sure that the sun really disappeared suddenly , and the flying star appeared just as suddenly?” “Y es, ab solutely . Y ou can check the historical annals. It was clearly recorded.” “Hmmm…” W a ng thought hard about this information. He had already formed some vague ideas about the workings of the world of Thr ee Body . But this bit of news from Mozi overturned all his theories. “ How can it be … sudden?” he muttered in annoyance.“W e’re n ow in the Han Dynasty I’m not sure if it’ s the W estern Han or the Eastern Han.” “Y ou’ve stayed alive until now?” “I have a missio n: observing the precise movements of the sun. Those shamans, metap hysicians, and Daoists are all useless. Like those proverbial bookish men who could not even tell types of grains apart, they do not labor with their hands, and know nothing practical. They have no ability to do experiments, and they’re immer sed in their mysticism all day long. But I’m dif ferent. I know how to ma ke things.” He pointed to the numerous instruments on the platform. “Do you think these can lead you to your goal?” W ang nodded specifically at the giant copper sphere. “I have theories , too, but they’re not mystical. They’re derived from a lar ge number of observations. First, do you know what the universe is? It’ s a machine.” “That’ s not very insightful.” “Let me be more specific: The universe is a hollow sphere floating in the m iddle of a sea of fire. There are numerous tiny holes in th e surface of the sphe re, as well as a lar ge on e. The light from the sea of flames shines through these holes. The tiny ones are stars, and the lar ge one is the sun.” “That’ s a very interesting mod el.” W ang looked at the giant copper sphere a gain an d guessed at its purpose. “But there’ s a problem with your theory . When the sun rises or sets, we can see its motion against the background of fixed stars. But in your hollow sphere, all the holes remain in fixed positions relative to each other .” “Correct! That’ s why I’ve modified my model. The universal s phere is made of two spheres, one inside the other . The sky we can see is the surface of the inner sphere. The outer sphere has one lar ge hole whi le the inner sphere h as many small holes. Th e light coming through the hole in the outer sphere i s reflect ed and scattered many times in the space between the two spheres, filling it with light. The n the light comes in through the tiny holes in the inner sphere, and that’ s how we see the stars.” “What about the sun?” “The sun is the result of the lar ge hole in the outer sphere being projected onto the inner one. The projection is so bright that i t penetrates the inner sphere like the shell of an egg, and that is how we see the sun.Around the spot of light, the sc attered light rays are also very bright, and can be seen through the inner shell. That is why we can see a clear sky during the day .” “What is the force that prope ls the two spheres in their irregular motion?” “It’ s the force of the sea of fire outside the two spheres.” “But the sun’ s brightness and size change over time. In your double- shell model, the sun’ s size and brightness ought to be fixed. Even if the brightness of the flames in the sea of fire is inconstant, the size of the hole would not be.” “Y our conception of this model is too simplistic. As condition s in the sea of fire shift and change, the two shells will expand and s hrink. This leads to changes in the size and brightness of the sun.” “What about the flying stars?” “Flying stars? Why do you ca re about them? They’re not important. Maybe just some random dust flying about the inside of the universal spheres.” “No, I think the flying stars ar e extremely important. Otherwise, how does your model explain the s udden extinguishing of the sun during the time of Confucius?” “That’ s a rare ex ception. Maybe it was because a dark spot or cloud in the sea of fire just happened to pass over the big hole in the outer shell.” W ang pointed to the lar ge copp er sphere. “This must be your model, then?” “Y es. I built a m achine to replicate the universe. The complex g ears that move the sphere simulate the forces from the sea of fire. The laws governing such motion are based on the distribution of flames in the sea of fire and the cur rents within it. I deduced them from hundreds of years of observations.” “Can this sphere contract and expand?” “Of course. Right now it’ s slowly contracting.” W ang u sed the handrail at the edge of the platform as a fixe d visual reference. He found Mozi’ s assertion to be true. “And there’ s an inner shell inside this sphere?” “Of course. The inner shell moves within the outer shell through another complex set of mechanisms.”“T ruly a skillfully designed machine!” W ang’ s praise was heartfelt. “But I don’ t see a lar ge hole in the outer shell to cast the sun’ s light onto the inner shell.” “There is no hol e. On the inner surface of the outer shell I have installed a source of light to simulate the hole. The light source is made of the luminescent material gathered from hundreds of thousands o f fireflies. I used a cool light because the inner shell is made of translucent plaster , which is not a good heat conductor . This way , I can avoid the problem of too muc h heat accumulating in side the sphere that we would have with a regular source of light. The observer can then stay inside for a long time.” “There’ s a person inside the sphere?” “Y es. A clerk stands on top of a shelf with a wheeled base that is kept at the c enter of the sphere. After w e set up the model universe to correspond to th e current st ate of the real universe, the motion of the mod el thereafter should b e an accurate simulatio n of the future, including the motion of the sun. Aft er the clerk records th e movements of the sun, we will have a precise calendar . This is the dream of hundreds of civilizations before us. “And it looks like you have come at an opportune time. According to the m odel universe, a four -year - long Stable Era is about to begin. Emperor W u of Han has just issued the order to rehydrate based on my prediction. Let’ s wait for sunrise!” Mozi br ought up the game’ s int erface and slightly increased the rate of passage of game time. A red sun rose above the horizon, and the numerous frozen lakes and ponds scattered over the plain began to melt. These lakes had been covered by dust and had mer ged into the dun ground, but now they turned into numerous mirrors, as though the earth had opened many eyes. Fr om up so high, W ang co uldn’ t see the details of rehydration, but he could se e more and more people gathered on the shores of th e lakes like swarms of ants coming out of their nests in spring. The world had once again been revived. “Do you not want to join this wonderful life?” Mozi asked, pointing to the g round below . “When wome n are first revived, they crave love. There is no reason for you to stay here any longer . The game is ove r . I am the winner .” “As a piece of machinery , your model universe is indeed incom parable. But as for its predictions.… May I use your telescope to observesomething?” “Please.” Mozi gestured at the lar ge telescope. W ang w alked u p to the instrument and paused. “How can I use it to observe the sun?” Mozi retrieved a black, circular piece of glass. “Use this smoked glass filter .” He inserted it in front of the eyepiece. W ang ai med the telescope at the sun, now halfway up the sky . He was impressed by Mozi’ s imaginati on. The sun did indeed look like a hole through which a sea of fire cou ld be seen, a small view into a much lar ger whole. But as he examined the image in the telescope more closely , he realized that the sun was dif ferent from the sun he was used to in real life. The sun here had a small core. He imagined the sun as an eye. The core was like the eye’ s pupil, and though it was small, it was bright and dense. The layers surrounding it, by contrast, appeared insubstantial, wispy , gaseous. The fact that he could see through the ou tside layers to the core indicate d that those layers were transparent or trans lucent, and the light from those layers was likely just scattered light from the core. The details in the image of the sun stunned W ang. He was once again assured that the game designers had hidden a vast amount of data within the superficially simple images, just waiting to be revealed by players. As W an g pondered the meaning of the sun’ s structure, he became excited. Because time in the game was now passing quickly , the sun was already in the w est. W ang stood, adjusted the telescope to aim at the sun again, and tracked it until it dipped below the horizon. Night fell, and the bonfires across the plains mirrored the sky full of stars. W ang took of f the smoked glass filter and continued to sca n the skies. He w as most in terested in the f lying stars, and shortly found two. He only had time to observe one of them briefly before it was dawn a gain. So he inserted the filter and continued to observe the sun.… In this manner W ang performed astronomical observations for more than ten days, enjoying the thrill of discovery . Indeed, the fact that time within the game had been sped up helped with the observations, as the motion of celestial bodies became more apparent. On t he s eventeenth day of the S table Era, five hours after the predicted time for sunrise , the world was still under cover of dark night. Multitudesthronged at the foot of the pyram id, their innumerable torches flickering in the chill wind. “The sun will pr obably not rise again. It is like at the end of Civilization Number 137,” W ang said to Mozi. Mozi stroked his beard and smiled confidently . “Do not fret. The sun will rise soon, and the Stable E ra will continue. I’ve already learned the secret of the mo tion of the universal machine. My prediction s cannot be wrong.” As thou gh con firming Mozi’ s words, the sky over the horizon brightened with dawn’ s first lig ht. The crowd around the pyram id shouted in joy . The silvery light brightened far more rapidly than usual, as though the rising sun wanted to make up fo r lost time. Soon, the light covered half the sky , even though the sun was still below the horizon. The world was already as bright as midday . W ang lo oked to ward the horizon and saw it giving of f a blindin g glare. The glowing horizon arched up ward and became a curve that spread from one edge of his visual field to the other . He soon realized tha t he wasn’ t seeing the horizon, but the edge of the rising sun, an incomparably immense sun. After hi s eyes adjusted to the br ight light, the horizon reappeared in its old place. W ang saw columns of black smoke rising in th e distance, especially clear against the glowing background of the solar disk. A fast horse ru shed tow ard the pyramid from the direction of the rising sun, the dust from its hooves forming a distinct line across the plains. The crow d parte d before the ho rse, and W ang heard the rider scream at the top of his lungs: “Dehydrate! Dehydrate!” Following the rider was a herd of cattle, horses, and other animals. Their bodies were on fire and they moved across the ground like a burning carpet. Half of the gigantic sun’ s disk was now above the horizon, ta king up much of the sky . The earth seemed to slowly sink down agains t a brilliant wall. W ang could clearly make out the fine structures on the surface of the sun: eddies and sur ging waves filling the sea of flames; sunspots floating along ra ndom paths like ghosts; the corona lazily spreading out like golden sleeves.On the ground, both those who had already dehydrated and th ose who hadn’ t b egan to burn like countl ess logs thrown into the belly of a furnace. The flam es that consumed them were even brighter than glowing charcoal in a furnace, but were quickly extinguished. The giant sun c ontinued to rise and soon filled most of the sk y . W ang looked u p and felt his perspective shift. Suddenly he was no lon ger looking up, b ut d own. T he surface of the giant sun became a fiery earth, and he felt himself falling toward this brilliant hell. Lakes an d pond s began to evap orate, and puf fs of white steam rose up like mus hroom clouds. They rose, spilled open, and dispersed, covering the ashes of the dead. “The Sta ble Era will continue. T he universe is a machine. I created this machine. The Stable Era will continue. The universe…” W ang turned his head. The voice belonged to Mozi, who was already on fire. His body was encased within a column of tall, orange flame, and his skin crinkled and turned into ch arcoal. But his two eyes still shone with a light tha t was distinct from the f ire consuming him. His two ha nds, already burning pieces of charcoal, hel d up the cloud of swirling ashes that had once been his calendar . W ang was burning up as well. He lifted his two hands and saw two torches. The sun briskly moved to the w est, revealing the sky behind it. It soon fell belo w the horizon, and the ground seemed to rise against the brilliant wall this time. A dazzling sunset swiftly turned to night, as though a pair of giant hands had pulled a black cloth over a world that had turned to ash. The earth glowed with a dim red light like a piece of charc oal just retrieved from a furnace. For a b rief moment, W ang saw the stars, but soon steam and smoke hid the sky a nd covered everything on the red-glowing earth. The world sank into a dark chaos. A red line of text appeared: Civilization Number 141 fell into ruin in flames. This civilization had advanced to the Eastern Han Period. The seed of civilization remains. It will germinate and again progress through the unpredictable world of Thr ee Body . W e invite you to log on in the future.W ang to ok of f the V -suit. Afte r his mind had calmed down a bit, he again ha d the thought that Thr ee Body w as deliberatel y pretending to be merely illusory , while in fact po ssessing some deep reality . The real world in fr ont of him, on the other han d, had begun to seem like the s uperficially complex, but in truth rather simple, Along th e River During the Qin gming Festival . * * * The next day , W ang went to the Nanotechnology Research Center . Other than som e minor confusion due to his absence the day before, everything was nor mal. He found work to be an ef fective tranquilizer . As long as he was abs orbed by it, he was no l onger bothered by his nightmarish worries. He d eliberately kept himself con stantly busy the whole day and left the lab only after it was dark. As s oon as W an g left the Research Center building, the nightm arelike feeling caught up to him. He fel t like the starry sky was a magnifying glass that covered the world, and h e was a tiny insect below the lens with nowhere to hide. He had to find something to occupy himself. Then he thought of Y ang Dong’ s mother Y e W enjie and drove to her home. Y e was alone at home. When W ang entered, she was sitting on the sofa reading. W ang noticed that her e yes were both myopic and presbyopic, and she had to swit ch glasses both when she read and when she looked at something far away . She was very happy to see W ang, and said that he looked much better than the last time he had come to see her . W ang chuckled. “It’ s all because of your ginseng.” Y e shoo k her head. “What I gav e you wasn’ t very good. W e used to be able to find really high-quality wild ginseng around the base. I once found one about this long.… I wonde r what it’ s like there now . I he ard that it’ s deserted. W ell, I guess I’m really getting old. These days, I’m always thinking about the past.” “I heard that you suf fered a lot during the Cultural Revolution.” “Y ou he ard it from Ruishan, didn’ t you?” Y e waved her hand, a s though trying to wave away a strand of spider silk. “In the past, it’ s all in the past. … Last night, Ruishan called me. He was in such a hurry that I had a hardtime understanding him. All I got was that something seemed to have happened to you. Xiao W ang, let me tell you: By the time you’re my age, you’ll re alize that everything you once thought mattered so mu ch turns out to mean very little.” “Thank you,” W ang said. He once again felt the warmth that he had missed. In his current state, his mental stability depended on two pillars: this old woman, who had weath ered so many storms and becom e as gentle as water , and Shi Qiang, the m an who feared nothing because he knew nothing. Y e conti nued. “As far as the Cultural Revolution is concerne d, I was pretty lucky . Just when I thought I had nowhere to go, I found a place where I could survive.” “Y ou mean Red Coast Base?” Y e nodded. “That w as truly an incredible pro ject. I used to think it was just made-up rumors.” “Not rumors. If you want, I can tell you some of what I experienced.” The of fe r made W ang a little w orried. “Professor Y e, I’m only curious. Y ou don’ t need to tell me if it’ s not appropriate.” “It’ s no big deal. Let’ s just imagine that I’m looking for someone to hear me talk.” “Y ou co uld go visit the senior center . Y ou wouldn’ t be lonely if you went there occasionally .” “Many o f those retirees were my colleagues back at the university , but somehow I just can’ t mix with them. Everyone likes to reminisce, but no one wants to listen, and everyone feels annoyed when someone else tells a story . Y ou’re the only one who’ s interested in Red Coast.” “But for you to tell me about those things … isn’ t that prohibited?” “That’ s trueit ’ s still classified. But after that book was published, many others who were there also began to tell their stories, so they’re like open secrets. The person who w rote that book was very irrespon sible. Even if we put aside his agenda, the c ontent of that book was often inaccurate. I should at least correct those errors.” Then Y e W enjie began to tell W ang about what happened to her during her years at Red Coast."
地球往事 三体 113 13．红岸之二 刚进入红岸基地时，叶文洁没有被分配固定工作，只是在一名安全 人员的监视下干一些技术上的杂事。 早在上大二时，叶文洁同后来的研究生导师就很熟悉。他对叶文洁 说，研究天体物理学，如果不懂实验技术，没有观测能力，理论再好也没 有用，至少在国内是这样。这与她父亲的观点倒是大相径庭。但叶文洁 是倾向于同意这种看法的，她总感觉父亲太理论了。导师是国内射电天 文学的开创者之一，在他的影响下，叶文洁也对射电天文产生了浓厚的 兴趣，她因此自学了电子工程和计算机专业 ① ， 这是该学科实验和观测 的技术基础。在读研究生的两年中，她同导师一起调试国内第一台小型 射电望远镜，又积累了不少这方面的经验。没有想到，她的这些知识竟 在红岸基地派到了用场。 叶文洁最初在发射部做设备维护和检修，很快成了发射部不可缺 少的技术骨干，这让她有些不解。她是基地里唯一不穿军装的人，更由 于她的身份，所有人都同她保持距离，这使得她只能全身心投入工作中 以排遣孤寂。但这也不足以说明问题，这毕竟是国防重点工程，难道这 里的技术人员就那么平庸，非要让她这个非工科出身也没有工作经验 的人轻易代替吗？ 她很快发现了一些原因。与表面看到的相反，基地配备的都是二炮 部队最优秀的技术军官，这些卓越的电子和计算机工程师，她再学一辈 子可能也赶不上。但基地地处偏僻，条件很差。而且红岸系统的主要研 ①当时在大部分院校，这两个专业是一体的。 中国科幻基石丛书 114 制工作已经结束，只是运行和维护，在技术上也没有什么做出成果的机 会，大多数人都不安心工作，他们知道，在这种最高密级的项目里，一旦 进入技术核心岗位，就很难调走。所以人们在工作中都故意将自己的能 力降低很多，但还不能表现落后，于是领导指挥向东，他就卖力气地向 西，故意装傻，指望领导产生这样的想法：这人也尽力了，但就这么点能 力和水平，留他没什么用，反而碍手碍脚的。 许多人真的这样成功地调离了。在这种情况下，叶文洁不知不觉中 成了基地的技术中坚。但走到这个位置的另一个原因却令她百思不得 其解：红岸基地至少在她接触的部分，没有什么真正意义上的先进技 术。 进入基地后，叶文洁主要在发射部工作，随着时间的推移，对她的 限制渐渐放松，那名时刻陪着她的监视人员也取消了，她可以接触红岸 系统的大部分结构，也可以阅读相应的技术资料。当然，禁止她接触的 东西还是有的，比如计算机控制部分，就绝对禁止她走近。但叶文洁后 来发现，那一部分对红岸系统的作用远没有她以前想象的那么大。比如 发射部的计算机， 是三台比 DJS130 还落后的设备， 使用笨重的磁心存 贮器和纸带输入，最长的无故障小时数不超过十五小时。她还看到过红 岸系统的瞄准部分，精度很低，可能还不如一门火炮的瞄准装具。 这天，雷政委又找叶文洁谈话。现在，在她的眼中，杨卫宁和雷志成 换了个位置。在这个年代，作为最高技术领导的杨卫宁在政治上的地位 并不高，离开技术就没有什么权威了，对部下也只能小心翼翼的，连对 哨兵说话都要客气些，否则就是知识分子对“三结合”和思想改造的态 度问题。于是，遇到工作上不顺心的时候，叶文洁就成了他唯一的出气 筒。但随着叶文洁在技术上变得越来越重要，雷政委渐渐改变了最初对 她的粗暴和冷漠，变得和蔼起来。 “小叶啊，到了现在，对发射系统这块你已经很熟悉了，这也是红 岸系统的攻击部分，是它的主体，说说你对这套系统的整体看法？”雷 政委说，他们这时坐在雷达峰的那道悬崖前，这里是基地最僻静的所 地球往事 三体 115 在。那笔直的绝壁似乎深不见底，最初令叶文洁胆战心惊，但现在她很 喜欢一个人到这里来。 对雷政委的问话，叶文洁有些不知所措。她只负责设备的维护和维 修，对红岸系统的整体情况，包括它的作用方式、攻击目标等，一概不 知，也不允许她知道，每次常规发射她都不能在场。她想了想，欲言又 止。 “大胆说吧。没关系。 ”雷政委扯下身边的一根草手里摆弄着说。 “它……不过就是一台无线电发射机嘛。 ” “不错，它就是一台无线电发射机。 ”雷政委满意地点点头， “你知道 微波炉吗？ ” 叶文洁摇摇头。 “西方资产阶级的奢侈玩意儿，用微波被吸收后产生的热效应加热 食物。我以前在的那个研究所，为了精密测试某种元件的高温老化， 从国外进口了一台。我们下了班也用它热馒头、烤土豆，很有意思，里面 先热，外头还是凉的。 ”雷政委说着站了起来，来回踱步，他走得如此贴 近悬崖边缘，令叶文洁十分紧张， “红岸系统就是一台微波炉，加热的 目标是敌人在太空中的航天器。只要达到 0.1～1瓦／平方厘米的微波 能量辐射，就可直接使卫星通信、雷达、导航等系统的微波电子设备失 效或烧毁。 ” 叶文洁恍然大悟。红岸系统虽然只是一台电波发射机，但并不等于 它就是个寻常之物，最令她吃惊的是它的发射功率，竟然高达二十五兆 瓦！这不仅远大于所有的通讯发射功率，也大于所有的雷达发射功率。 红岸系统由一组庞大的电容提供发射能量，由于功率巨大，它的发射电 路也与常规的有很大不同。叶文洁现在明白了这种超大发射功率的用 途，但她立刻想到了个问题： “系统发射的电波，好像是经过调制的。 ” “是的，但这种调制与常规无线电通讯完全不同，不是为了加载信 息，而是用变化的频率和振幅突破敌人可能进行的屏蔽防护，当然，这 中国科幻基石丛书 116 些还都在试验中。 ” 叶文洁点点头，以前心中的许多其他疑问现在也都得到了解答。 “最近， 从酒泉发射了两颗靶标卫星， 红岸系统进行的攻击试验， 完全成功，摧毁了目标，使卫星内部达到了近千度的高温，搭载的仪器 和摄影设备全部被破坏。在未来实战中，红岸系统可以有效打击敌人 的通信和侦察卫星，美帝目前的主力侦察卫星 KH8 ，和即将发射的 KH9 ，苏修那些轨道更低的侦察卫星就更不在话下了。必要的时候，还 有能力摧毁苏修的礼炮号空间站和美帝计划于明年发射的天空实验 室。” “政委，你在对她说些什么？”有人在叶文洁身后说。她转身一看， 是杨卫宁，他盯着雷政委，目光很严厉。 “我这是为了工作。 ”雷政委扔下一句话，转身走了。杨卫宁无言地 看了叶文洁一眼，也跟着走去，只丢下叶文洁一人。 “是他把我带进基地的。 可到现在他还是不信任我。 ” 叶文洁悲哀 地想，同时在为雷政委担心。在基地，雷志成的权力大于杨卫宁，各项重 大事务政委有最终决定权。但刚才他匆匆离去的样子，显然是觉得在总 工程师面前做错了什么事，这让叶文洁确信他将红岸的真实用途告诉 自己，可能只是个人的决定。对于他这将产生什么样的后果？看着雷政 委那魁梧的背影，叶文洁心中涌上了一股感激之情，对于她，信任无疑 是一种不敢奢望的奢侈品。与杨卫宁相比，雷志成是叶文洁心目中真正 的军人，有着军人的坦诚和直率，而杨卫宁只是一个她见过很多的这个 时代典型的知识分子，胆小谨慎，只求自保平安。虽然叶文洁理解他，但 与他本来就很远的距离更拉远了。 第二天，叶文洁被调离了发射部，安排到监听部工作。她原以为这 与昨天的事有关，是将她调离红岸的核心部门，但到监听部后，才发现 这里更像红岸的核心。虽然两个部门在设备系统上有重叠之处，比如共 用同一个天线，但监听部的技术水平比发射部要先进一个层次。 监听部有套十分先进的电波灵敏接收系统，从巨型天线接收到的 地球往事 三体 117 信号通过红宝石行波微波激射器放大为了抑制系统本身的干扰， 竟将接收系统的核心部分浸泡于- 269℃的液氦中，液氦由直升机定期 运来以补充消耗。这使得系统具有极高的灵敏度，能够接收到很微弱的 讯号。叶文洁不禁想，如果用这套设备从事射电天文研究，那将是多么 美妙的事情啊。 监听部的计算机系统也远比发射部庞大复杂，叶文洁第一次走进 主机房时，看到一排阴极射线管显示屏，她惊奇地发现，屏幕上竟滚动 着排排程序代码，可以通过键盘随意进行编辑和调试。而她在大学里 使用计算机时，代码都写在一张张打格的程序纸上，再通过打字机噼噼 啪啪地打到纸带上。她听说过从键盘和屏幕输入这回事，现在竟然真的 看到了。但更令她吃惊的是这里的软件技术。她知道了一种叫 FORTRAN 的东西 ① ，竟能用接近自然语言的代码编写程序，能将数学公 式直接写到代码里，它的编程效率比机器码汇编不知高了多少倍。还有 一种叫数据库的东西，竟能那样随心所欲地操纵海量数据。 两天后，雷政委又找叶文洁谈话，这次是在监听部的主机房里。在 那一排闪着绿光的计算机显示器前。杨卫宁坐在距他们不远处，既不想 参加他们的谈话，又不能放心离开，这令叶文洁感到很不自在。 雷政委说： “小叶，现在我向你说明监听部的工作内容，简单地说， 就是对敌人的太空活动进行监视，包括监听敌人航天器与地面和航天 器间的通讯，与我航天测控部门配合，锁定敌航天器的轨道位置，为红 岸系统的作战提供依据，可以说，是红岸的眼睛。 ” 杨卫宁插进来说： “雷政委，我觉得你这样不好，真的没必要对她 说这些。 ” 叶文洁看看不远处的杨卫宁，不安地说： “政委，如果不适宜让我 了解，就……” “不不，小叶， ”雷政委抬起一只手制止叶文洁说下去，转身对杨卫 宁说， “杨总，还是那句话，为了工作，要进一步发挥小叶的作用，她 ①第一代计算机高级语言。 中国科幻基石丛书 118 该知道的还是得知道。 ” 杨卫宁站了起来， “我要向上级汇报！ ” “这当然是你的权利。不过，杨总，请你放心，对这事，我负一切责 任。 ”雷政委平静地说。 杨卫宁起身悻悻地离去。 “你别在意，杨总就这样，过分谨慎，有时工作放不开手脚。 ”雷政 委笑着摇摇头，然后直视着文洁，语气郑重起来， “小叶，最初带你来基 地， 目的很单纯： 红岸监听系统经常受到太阳斑耀和黑子活动产生的电 磁辐射的干扰，我们意外地看到了你的那篇论文，发现你对太阳活动有 比较深入的研究，在国内，你提出的预测模型是最准确的，所以就想让 你协助解决这个问题。但你来了后，在技术上表现出了很强的工作能 力。所以我们决定让你承担更多、更重要的工作。我是这么打算的：让你 先到发射部，再到监听部，对红岸系统有一个整体的了解和熟悉，至于 以后安排什么工作，我们再研究。当然，你也看到了，这有阻力，但我是 信任你的。小叶，这里要说明，到目前为止，这种信任还只是我个人的， 希望你能努力工作，最后赢得组织上的信任。 ”雷政委把一只手放到叶 文洁的肩上，她感到了这只有力的手传递的温暖和力量， “小叶啊，告 诉你我的一个真切的希望吧：希望有一天，能称呼你叶文洁同志。 ” 雷政委说完站起来，迈着军人的稳健步伐离去。叶文洁的双眼盈满 了泪水，透过眼泪，屏幕上的代码变成了一团团跳动的火焰。自父亲死 后，这是她第一次流泪。 叶文洁开始熟悉监听部的工作。她很快发现，自己在这里远不如在 发射部顺利，她已有的计算机知识早已落后，大部分软件技术都得从头 学起。虽然有雷政委的信任，但对她的限制还是很严的，她可以看程序 源代码，但不许接触数据库。 在日常工作中，叶文洁更多是接受杨卫宁的领导，他对她更加粗暴 了，动不动就发火。雷政委多次劝他也没用，好像一见到叶文洁，他就充 满了一种无名的焦虑。 地球往事 三体 119 渐渐地，叶文洁在工作中发现的许多不可理解的事，使她感觉到红 岸工程远比她想象的复杂。 监听系统接收到一系列值得注意的信息，经过计算机译解，发现是 几幅卫星照片，很模糊，送到总参测绘局判读，发现均为我境内重要目 标，其中有青岛军港和几个大三线重点军工企业的照片。经过分析，确 认这些照片来自美国的 KH9 侦察卫星，第一颗 KH9 刚刚完成试验发 射，主要是以胶片舱回收方式传递情报，但也在进行更加先进的无线电 数码传递试验，由于技术不成熟，传送频率较低，所以信息泄漏较大，能 被红岸系统接收到。由于是试验传送，加密级别较低，能够被破解，这无 疑是最重要的监视对象，是了解美国太空侦察系统不可多得的机会。可 是第三天，杨卫宁竟命令转移监听频率和方向，丢开了这个目标，叶文 洁总觉得这不可理解。 另一件事则令她震惊：虽然身在监听部，但发射部有些事情还让她 去做。一次，她无意中看到了未来几次发射计划的频率设置，发现在第 304、318和325次发射中，确定的发射频率己低出了微波范围，不可能 在目标上产生任何热效应。 这天，突然有人通知叶文洁到基地总部办公室去，从那名军官的语 气和神色中，叶文洁感到了不祥。 走进办公室后，一个似曾相识的场景出现了：基地的主要领导都在 场，还有两名不认识的军官，一看就是更高一级部门来的人，所有人冰 冷的目光聚焦到她身上。但这么多年的风风雨雨形成的敏感告诉她，今 天倒霉的人可能不是她，她最多是一个陪葬品。她看到雷志成政委坐在 一角，神色黯然。他终于要为对我的信任付出代价了，这是叶文洁心中 冒出的第一个念头，她在一瞬间暗下决心，为了不牵连到雷政委，一定 要将事情向自己身上揽，甚至不惜说谎。但她没有想到第一个开口的竟 然就是雷政委，他的话更是完全出乎自己的预料。 “叶文洁，首先声明，我是不同意这么做的，下面的决定是杨总工 程师请示上级后做出的， 他将对后果负完全责任。 ” 说完他看了杨卫宁 中国科幻基石丛书 120 一眼，后者郑重地点点头， “为了更好地发挥你在红岸基地的作用，这 些天来，经过杨总工程师反复向上级请示，兵种政治部派来的同志也了 解了你的工作情况， ”他指了指那两名陌生的军官， “经过上级同意，我 们决定将红岸工程的真实情况告诉你。 ” 过了好半天，叶文洁才明白了雷政委这话的含意：他一直在欺骗 她！ “希望你珍惜这次机会，努力工作，立功赎罪。今后，你在基地只许 老老实实，不许乱说乱动，任何反动行为都将受到最严厉的惩罚。 ”雷 政委盯着叶文洁厉声说道，与以前叶文洁眼中的他相比仿佛换了一个 人，“听明白了吗？那好，请杨总工程师为你介绍红岸工程的情况吧。 ” 其他人纷纷离去，办公室中只剩下杨卫宁和叶文洁两人。 “如果你不同意，现在还来得及。 ”杨卫宁说。 叶文洁知道这话的分量，也理解了杨卫宁这些天见到她时的那种 焦躁。为了在基地发挥她的才华，必须让她知道红岸工程的真实情况， 但这又意味着叶文洁走出雷达峰的最后一线希望也将不复存在，红岸基 地将是她一生最终的归宿。 “我同意。 ”叶文洁轻轻地，但坚定地说。 于是，在这个初夏的黄昏，在巨型天线风中的轰鸣声和远方大兴安 岭的松涛声中，杨卫宁向叶文洁讲述了真实的红岸工程，这是一个比雷 志成的谎言更加令人难以置信的时代神话。,"1 2 R e d C o a s t I I Y e wasn ’ t given a real job immediately after entering Red C oast Base. Under the watchful eyes of a security guard, she was only allowed to perform a few technical tasks. Back wh en she was still a secon d-year in college, Y e had already known the professor who would end u p being her thesis advisor . He had told Y e that to do astrophysics research , it was useless to excel at the ory without knowledge of experimental methods and observational skillsat least, that was true in China. This was ve ry dif ferent from her father ’ s view , but Y e tended to agree with her professor . She had always felt that her father was too theoretical. Her advisor was one of the pion eers of Chinese radio astronomy . Under his influence, Y e developed a great interest in radio astronomy as well. Thus, she taught herself electri cal engineering and computer science, the foundation for experiments and observations in the field. During the two years wh en she was a graduate student, the two of them had tes ted China’ s first small-scale radio telescope and had accumulated a great deal of experience in the area. She had n’ t expected the knowledge would one day be useful at Red Coast Base. Eventually , Y e was assigned to the T ransmission Department to maintain and repair equipment. She quickly became an indispensable part of their operations.Initially , this confused her a bit. She was the only person at the base who wasn’ t in a military unifor m. And given her political statu s, everyone kept their distance. She had no way to ward of f the loneliness other than devoting herself to work. Howe ver , this wasn’ t enough to expla in why they relied on her so much. This was, after all, a key defense project. How could the tech nical sta f f here be so mediocre that she, who had not majored in engineering and who had no rea l working experience, easily took over their jobs? She learned the reason soon eno ugh. Contrary to appearances, the base’ s staf f was composed of the best technical of ficers from the Second Artillery Corps. S he could study all her life and have no hope of catching up to those excellent electri cal and computer engineers. But the base was remote, the conditions were poor , and the main research work of the Red C oast Project was alre ady com pleted. All that was left was maintenance and operation, so there was little opportunity for achieving any interesting techn ical results. Most people did not want to be indispensable, because they und erstood that in highl y classif ied projects like this, once someone was put into a core technical positio n, it would be very dif ficult for him to be tran sferred out. Thus, al l of them tried to deliberately hide their technical competence as they went about their jobs. Y et, they couldn’ t appear too incompetent. So if the supervisor said to go east, they would work hard to move west, purposely playing the fool. Their ho pe was to put the follow ing thought into the supervisor ’ s head: This man is working har d, but he’ s limited in his skills. Ther e’ s no point in keeping him, because he’ll only get in the way . Many really did successfully obtain transfers through this method. Under such conditions, Y e gradually became a key technician at the base. Bu t the other reason that s he could achieve this position puzzled her , and for that she could find no explanation: Red Coast Base at least the parts that she had contact withhad no real advanced technology at all. Over time, as Y e continued to work at the T ransmission Departm ent, the restrictions on her were gradually relaxed, and even the security guard assigned to watch her was called of f. She was allowed to touch most components of Red Coast’ s sys tems, and could read the releva nt technical documents. Of course, there were still areas forbidden to her . For example, she was n’ t allowed near the computer control systems. However , Y ediscovered that the impact of those systems on Red Coast was far smaller than she had imagined. For instance, the T ransmission Department’ s computers consisted of three machines even more primitive than DJS130.24 They used cumbersome magnet ic core memory and paper inp ut tape, and their lon gest up time did not ex ceed fifteen hours. She also s aw that the precision of Red Coast’ s tar geti ng system was very low , probably not even on par with that of an artillery cannon. One day , Comm issar Lei came to speak with Y e. By this tim e, Y ang W eining and Lei Zhicheng had swapped places in her eyes. During those years, Y ang, as the highest-ranked technical of ficer , did not e njoy a high political status, and outside of technical matters he had little authority . He had to be carefu l with his subordinates, and had to speak politely even to the sentries, lest he be deemed to have an intellectual’ s resistant attitude toward t hought reform and collaboration with the masses. Thus, whenever he encountered dif ficulties in his work, Y e became his punching bag. But as Y e gained importance as a technical staf f member , Commissar Lei gradually shed his initial rudeness and coldness and became kind toward her . Commissar Lei said, “W enjie, by now you’re pretty familiar with the transmission system. This is also Red Coast’ s of fensive component, its principal part. Can you give me your views of the system as a whole?” They were sitting at the lip of the steep clif f on Radar Peak, t he most secluded spot on the base. The clif f seemed to drop straight of f into a bottomless abys s. At first, the spot had frightened Y e, but now she liked to come here by herself. Y e wasn’ t sure how to answer Commissar Lei’ s question. She was only responsible for maintaining and repairing equipment and knew nothing about R ed Coas t as a whole, including its operation, tar gets, and so on. Indeed, she wasn’ t allowed to know . She wasn’ t even permitted to be present at the tra nsmission. She pondered the question, began to speak, and stopped herself. “Go ahe ad, speak your mind,” Commissar Lei said. He ripped out a blade of grass next to him and played with it absent-mindedly . “It … is just a radio transmitter .” “That’ s right, just a radio transmitter .” The commissar nodded, s atisfied. “Do you know about microwave ovens?”Y e shook her head. “They a re a luxury plaything of the capitalist W est. Food is h eated by the e ner gy generated from abso rbing microwave radiation. At my previous research station , in order to precisely test the high-temperature aging of certain c omponents, we importe d one. After work, we would use it to warm mantou b read, bake a p otato, that sort of thing. It’ s very interesting: The inside heats up first while the outside remains cold.” Commissar Lei stood up and paced back and forth. He was so close to the edge of the clif f that it made Y e nervous. “Red Co ast is a microwave oven, and its heating tar gets are the enemy’ s space ve ssels. If we can apply microwave radiation at a specific power level of o ne-tenth of a watt to one w att per square centimeter , we’ll be able to disable or destroy many electronic components of satellite communications, radar , and navigation systems.” Y e fina lly understood. Even though Red Coast was only a radio transmitter , that didn’ t mean it was conventional. The most surprising aspect was its transmission power: as high as twenty-five megawatts! This wasn’ t just more powerful than all communication transmissions, but also all r adar transmissions. Red Coast relied on a set of gigantic capacitors. Because the power requiremen ts were so high, the transmission circuits were also dif ferent from conventional designs. Y e now understood the purpose of such ultrahigh power in the system, but something seemed wrong right away . “The emission from the system seems to be modulated.” “That’ s right. However , the modulation is unlike that used in conventional radio communications. The purpose isn’ t to add information, but to use shifting frequenci es and amplitudes to penetrate possible shielding by the enemy . Of course, those are still experimental.” Y e nodded. Many of her questions had now been answered. “Recently , two tar get satellites were launched from Jiuquan. The test attacks b y Red Coast were completely successful. T emperatur e inside the satellites reache d nearly a thousand degrees, and all instruments and photographic eq uipment onboar d were destroyed. In future wars , Red Coast can ef fectively strike at the enemy’ s communication and reconnaissance satellites, like the KH-8 spy sat ellites on which the American Imperialists rely , as well as the KH-9, which are about to be launched. The lower -orbit spy satellites of the Soviet R evisionists are even more vulnerable. Ifnecessary , we even have the capacity to destroy the Salyut space station of the Sovi et Revisionists and the Skylab station that American Imperialists plan on launching next year .” “Commissar! W hat are you telling her?” Someone spoke behind Y e. She turned and saw that it was Y ang W eining, who stared at Commissar Lei severely . “This is for work,” Commissar Lei said, and then left. Y ang gl anced at Y e without saying anything and followed Lei. Y e was left all by herself. He’ s the one w ho br ought me her e, but he still doesn’ t trus t me, a disconsolate Y e thought. She was worried about Commissar Lei. At the base, Lei had more authority than Y ang, since the commissar had the final vote on most important matters , but the way he rushed away with Y ang seemed to indicate that he felt the chief engineer had caught him doing something wrong. This convince d Y e that Lei had made a perso nal decision to tell her about the true purpose of the Red Coast Project. What wi ll happen to him as a r esult of this decision? As she gazed at Commissar Lei’ s burly back, Y e felt a wave of gratitude. For her , trust was a luxury that she dared not wish for . Compared to Y ang, Lei was closer to her image of a real military of ficer , possessing a soldier ’ s frank and forthright mann ers. Y ang, on the other hand, was nothing more than a typical i ntellectual of the period: cautious, timid, seeking only to protect himself. Even though Y e under stood him, the wide gulf alrea dy between them grew wider . The next day , Y e was transferred out of the T ransmission Dep artment and assigned to the Monitoring Department. At first, she thought this was related t o the events of the day before, an attempt to move her away from the c ore of Red Coast. But after arriving at the Monitoring Depa rtment, she realized that this was mo re like the heart of Red Coast. Even though the two departments sha red some resources, such as the antenna, the technology level of the Monitoring Department was far more advanced. The Monitoring Department had a very sophisticated and sensitive radio receiver . A ruby-based traveling-wave maser25 amplified the signals received by the gigantic antenna , and in order to minimize interference, the core of the reception system was immersed in liquid helium at - 269 degrees Celsius. Periodically , a helicopter came to replenish the supply of liquidhelium. The reception system was thus capable of picking up very faint signals. Y e couldn’ t help but im agine how wonderful it would be to use the equipment for radio astronomy research. The Monitoring Department’ s computer system was also much bigger and more complex than the one at the T ransmission Department. The first time she entered the main compu ter room, Y e saw a row of catho de ray tube displays. She was stunned to see programming code scrolling across each of them, and the operators were free to edit and test the cod e using the keyboard. When she learned programming in college, the source code was always w ritten on the grids of special programming paper , then transferred to paper tape using a typewriter . She had heard of input using a keyboard and screen, but this was the first time she had seen it. The sof tware available astonished her even more. She learned about something called FOR TRAN, which allowed you to progra m using a language close to natural lang uage. Y ou could even type mathematical equations directl y into the code! Programming in it was several times more ef ficient than programming in m achine code. And then there wa s something called a database, which allowe d for easy storage and manipulation of vast amounts of data. T wo day s later , Commissar Lei sought Y e out for another talk. This time, the y were in the main computer room of the Monitoring D epartment, in front of the row of green-glowing screens. Y ang W eining sat close by , not part of their con versation, but also not willing to leave, which made Y e very uncomfortable. “W enjie,” Commissar Lei beg an, “let me explain the work of the Monitoring Dep artment to you. Simply put, the goal is to keep an eye on enemy a ctivities in space, including intercepting communications between enemy space vessels and the ground, and between the space vessels themselves; collaborating with our telemetry , tracking, and command centers t o determ ine the orbits o f enemy space vessels and prov ide data for Red Coa st’ s com bat systems. In other words, the eyes of Red Coast are here.” Y ang int errupted, “Commissar Lei, I don’ t think what you’re do ing is a good idea. There’ s no need to tell her these things.” Y e glan ced at Y ang and anx iously said, “Commissar , if it’ s not appropriate for me to know , then”“No, no, W enjie.” The commi ssar held up a hand to stop Y e from speaking. He turned to Y ang. “C hief Y ang, I’m going to tell you the same thing I did befor e. This is for work. For W enjie to perform her duties better , she must be told the purpose of her work.” Y ang stood up. “I will report this to our superiors.” “That is your rig ht, of course. B ut do not fret, Chief Y ang. I will assume responsibility for all consequences.” Y ang got up and left with a bitter expression. “Don’ t m ind him. That’ s just th e way Chief Y ang is.” Commissar Lei chuckled and shook his head. Then he stared at Y e and his tone became solemn. “W enji e, when we fir st brought you to the base, the goal was simple. Red Coast’ s monitoring systems often had interference caused by electromagnetic radiation from solar flares and sunspots. Fortuitously , we saw your paper and realized that you had researched solar activity . Among Chinese scholars , your predictive model turned out to be the mo st accurate, so we wanted to ask for your help in solving this problem. “But after you came, you showed very strong abilities, so we decided to give you more responsibilities. My thought was this: assign you first to the T ransmission D epartment, then the Monitoring Department. This way , you’d ga in a comprehensive und erstanding of Red Coast as a whole and we could wait and see where to assign you after that. “Of cou rse, as you can see, this plan has met with some resistan ce. But I have trust in you, W enjie. Let me be clear: Until now , the tru st placed in you has been m ine, personally . I hope that you can continue to work hard and earn the trust of the or ganization as a whole.” Commissar Lei placed a hand on Y e’ s shoulder . She felt the war mth and strength conveye d through it. “W enjie, let me tell you my sincere hope: One day , I’d like to call you Comrade Y e .” Lei stoo d up and strode away in the confident manner of a sold ier . Y e’ s eyes were filled with tears. Seen through them, the code on the screen became flickering flames. This was the first time she had cried since the death of her father . As Y e familiarized herself with the work of the Monitoring Dep artment, she discovered that she was far less successful here than at the T ransmission Department. The computer scie nce knowledge she had was outdated, and she had to learn the softwar e techniques from scratch. Even thoughCommissar Lei trusted her , the restrictions on her were sever e. She was allowed to view the software source code, for example, but was forbidden from touching the database. On a day-to-day basis, Y e was mainly supervised by Y ang. He became even ru der to her , and would get angry at her for the sma llest things. Commissar Lei talked to him about it multiple times witho ut ef fect. It seemed that Y ang became filled with a nameless anxiety as soon as he saw Y e. Gradually , as Y e encountered more and more unexplainable matters in her wor k, she came to realize that the Red Coast Project was far more complex than she had imagined. One day , the monitoring system intercepted a transmission that, after being d eciphered by the computer , turned out to be a few satellite photographs. The blurry im ages were sent to the General Staf f Department’ s Surveying and Mapping Bureau for interpretation. They turned out to be images of important military tar gets in China, including the naval harbor at Qingdao and several key factories of the T hird Front program.26 Analys is confirmed that these images came from the KH-9 American reconnaissance system. The first KH-9 satellite had just been launched. Although it mainly relied on recoverable film caps ules for intelligence gathering, it was also being used to test out the more advanced technique of radio transmission of digital im ages. Due to the technology’ s immaturity , the satellite transmitted at a low frequency , which increased its range of reception suf ficiently for it to be intercepted by Red Coast. And because it was only a test, the encryption was not very secure and could be broken. The KH-9 was without a doub t an important monitoring tar get, as it presented a rare opportunity to gather more information about American satellite reconna issance system s. Y et, after the third day , Y ang W eining ordered a change in the freq uency and direction of monitoring and abandoned the tar get. Y e found the decision incomprehensible. Another event also shocked her . Even though she was now in the Monitoring Department, sometimes the T ransmission Department still needed h er . One time, she accid entally saw the frequency settings for a few upcoming transmissions. She discovered that the designated frequencies fortransmissions 30 4, 318, and 325 were lower than microwave range and could not result in any heating ef fect in the tar get. One day , an of fi cer summoned Y e to the main base administrative of fice out of the blue . From the of f icer ’ s tone and expression, Y e knew that something had gone wrong. As s he w alked i nto the of fice, th e scene before her seemed fam iliar: All the seni or of fice rs of the base were present, along with two of ficers she didn’ t know . However , she coul d tell at a glance that they were from higher up in the chain of command. Everyone’ s icy stares focused on her , but the sensitivity she had developed over the stormy years informed her that she wasn’ t the one in big trouble today . She was at most a sideshow . She saw Commissar Lei sitting in a corner with a dejected look. He’ s finally going to pay for trusting me, s he thought. A t once, she decided that she would do what ever she could to save him. She would take responsibility for everything, even lie if necessary . But Commissar Lei was the first to speak, and what he s aid was completely unex pected. “Y e W enjie, I must make it clear at the start that I do not agree with what is about to be done. The decision was made by Chief Engineer Y ang after requesting instructions from our superiors. He alone will be responsible for all consequences.” Commissar Lei turned to look at Y ang, who nodded solemnly . Lei continued, “In order to better utilize your skills at Red Coast Base, Chief Engineer Y ang repeatedly requested permission from our superiors to abandon the cover story we’ve been using with you. Our comrades from the Army Po litical Department”he indicated the two of ficers Y e didn’ t know “were sent to investigate you r work situation. Finally , with t he approval of our superiors , we’ve decided to inform you of the true nature of the Red Coast Project.” Only af ter a long pause did Y e finally understand Commiss ar Lei’ s meaning: He had been lying to her all along. “I ho pe you will treasure this op portunity and work hard to rede em your sins. After this, y ou must behave with the utmost propriety . Any reactionary behavior will be severely punished!” Commissar Lei stared at Y e. He was a completely dif fe rent person from the image Y e had formed of hi m. “Are we clear? Good. Now Chief Y ang can explain.”The others left, leaving only Y ang and Y e. “If you don’ t want this, there’ s still time.” Y e discerned the weight behi nd these words. She now un derstood Y ang’ s a nxiety w henever he had seen her the last few weeks. T o make full use of her skills, it was necessary for her to know the truth about Red Coast. However , this choice would extinguish the last ray of hope she had of ever leaving Radar Peak. Once she s aid yes, she really would spend the rest of her life at Red Coast Base. “I agree,” Y e said, softly , but resolutely . Thus, on this early summer evening, as the wind howled through the giant pa rabolic a ntenna, and as the forest rustled over the Greater Khingan Mountains in the distance, Y an g W eining explained to Y e W enjie the true nature of Red Coast. It was a fairy tale for the ages, even more incredible than the commissar ’ s lies."

I. A Question Largely Ignor ed by T r ends in Fundamental W orld Scientific Resear ch (Originally published in Internal Reference, XX/XX/196X) [ Abstract ] Based on modern and contemporary history , there are two ways in whi ch the results of fundamental scientific research can be converted into practical ap plications: gradualistic mode and saltatory mode. Gradualistic mo de: theoretical, fundamental results are graduall y applied to technology; advances accumulate until they reach a breakthrough. Recent examples include the development of s pace technology . Saltatory mode: theoretical, fundamental results rapidly becom e applied technology , leading to a technological leap. Recent examples include the appearance of atomic weapons. Until the forties, some of the foremost physicists still tho ught it would never be possib le to release t he ener gy of the atom. But atomic weapons then appearedwithin a very short period. W e define a technology leap to o ccur when fundamental science is converted to applied technology across a great span in an extremely brief time interval. Currently , both NA T O and the W arsaw Pact are intensely active in fu ndamental research and in vesting heavily in it. One or more technological leaps can occur at any time. Such an occurrence will pose a major threat to our strategic planning. This arti cle ar gues that our focu s is currently on the gradualistic mode of technology development and insuf ficient attention is paid to the p ossibility of technology leaps. Starting from a higher vantage point, we should develop a comprehensive strategy and set of principles so that we can respond appropriately when technological leaps occur . Fields where technological leaps are most likely: Physics: [ omitted ] Biology: [ omitted ] Computer Science: [ omitted ] The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI): Of all fields, this is the one in which the possibility for a technology leap is greatest. If a lea p occurs in this field, the impact will exceed the sum of technology leaps in the other three fields. [ Full T ext ][omitted] [ Instructions fr o m Central Leadership ] D istrib ute this article to appr opriate personnel and or ganize discussion groups. The article’ s views will not be to the liking of some, but let’ s not ru sh to label the author . The key is to appreciate the author ’ s long-term thinking. Some comrades canno t see beyond the ends of their noses, possibly because of the greater political environment, possibly because of their arrogance. This is not good. Strategic blind spots are extremely dangerous. In my view , of the four fields wh ere technology leaps may occur , we have given the least thought to the last one. It’ s worth some attention, and we should systematically analyze the matter in depth. Signed: XXX Date: XX/XX/196X II.Resear ch Report on the Possibility of T echnology Leap Due to the Sear ch for Extraterr estrial Intelligence 1. Current International Research T rends [ Summary ] (1) The United States and other NA T O states: The scientific case and the necessity for SETI ar e generally accepted, and strong academic support exists. Project Ozma: In 1960, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank, W est V ir ginia, searched for extraterrestrial intelligence with a radio telescope 26 meters in diameter . The project examined the stars T au Ceti and Epsilon Eridani for 200 hours using ranges near the 1.420 gigahertz frequency . Project Ozma II, which will involve more tar gets and a broader frequency range, is planned for 1972. Probes: The Pioneer 10 and Pio neer 1 1 probes, each of which will carry a metal plaque containing information about civilization on Earth , are scheduled for launch in 1972. The V oyager 1 a nd V oyager 2 probes, each of which will carry a metal audio record, are scheduled for launch in 1977. The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico: Constructed in 1963, this is an important instrument for SETI. Its ef fective ener gy collection area is about 20 acres, which is greater than the sum of the collecting areas of all othe r radio telescopes in the wor ld. When combined with its computer system, it can simultaneously monitor 65,000 channels and is also capable of ultrahigh-ener gy transmissions.

地球往事 三体 127 15．红岸之四 “叶老师，我有一个问题：在当时，探索外星文明只是定位于一个 有些边缘化的基础研究，为什么红岸工程具有如此高的保密级别呢？” 听完叶文洁的讲述，汪淼问。 “其实这个问题在红岸工程的最初阶段就有人提出，并一直延续 到红岸的最后。现在，你应该有了答案，我们只能佩服红岸工程最高决 策者思维的超前了。 ” “是的，很超前。 ”汪淼深深地点点头说。 与外星文明的接触一旦建立，人类社会将受到什么样的和何种程度 的影响，这作为一个严肃的课题被系统深入地研究，还只是近两年的 事。但这项研究急剧升温，得出的结论令人震惊。以前天真的理想主义 愿望破灭了，学者们发现，与大多数人美好的愿望相反，人类不可能作 为一个整体与外星文明接触，这种接触对人类文化产生的效应不是融 合而是割裂，对人类不同文明间的冲突不是消解而是加剧。总之，接触 一旦发生，地球文明的内部差异将急剧拉大，后果可能是灾难性的。最 惊人的结论是：这种效应与接触的程度和方式（单向或双向） ，以及所 接触的外星文明的形态和进化程度，没有任何关系！ 这就是兰德思想库社会学学者比尔马修在《十万光年铁幕： SETI 社会学》一书中提出的“接触符号”理论。他认为，与外星文明的接触， 只是一个符号或开关，不管其内容如何，将产生相同的效应。假如发生 一个仅仅证明外星文明的存在而没有任何实质内容的接触马修称 其为元接触其效应也能通过人类群体的心理和文化透镜被放大， 中国科幻基石丛书 128 对文明的进程产生巨大的实质性的影响。这种接触一旦被某个国家或 者政治力量所垄断，其意义与经济和军事实力相当。 “那红岸工程的结局呢？ ”汪淼问。 “你应该能想到的。 ” 汪淼又点点头，他当然知道，如果红岸成功了，世界就不是今天的 世界了，但他还是说了一句安慰的话： “其实成功与否现在还不得而 知，红岸发出的电波，到现在在宇宙中也没走多远呀。 ” 叶文洁摇摇头： “电波信号传得越远越微弱，太空中干扰太多，外 星文明收到的可能性很小。研究发现：为了使宇宙中的外星文明接收到 我们的电波信号，我们的发射功率应该与一颗中等恒星的辐射功率相 当。苏联天体物理学家卡达谢夫曾建议，可以根据宇宙中不同文明用于 通讯的能量，来对它们分级。他将想象中的文明分为Ⅰ、Ⅱ、Ⅲ三种类 型：Ⅰ型文明能够调集与地球整个输出功率相当的能量用于通讯。当时 他的估计，地球的功率输出约为 10 15 ～10 16 瓦。Ⅱ型文明能够把相当于 一颗典型恒星的输出功率， 10 26 瓦用于通讯。Ⅲ型文明用于通讯的功率 达10 36 瓦，约等于整个星系的功率输出。目前的地球文明只能大致定为 0.7型连Ⅰ型都未达到， 而红岸的发射功率又仅仅是地球能调集的 输出功率的千万分之一，这一声呼唤，就像万里长空中的一只蚊子在嗡 嗡叫，不会有谁听见的！ ” “可如果那个苏联人所设想的Ⅱ和Ⅲ型文明真的存在，我们应该 能够听到他们的声音。 ” “红岸运行的二十多年，我们什么都没有听到。 ” “是，想到红岸和 SETI ，会不会这一切努力最后证明了一件事：宇 宙中真的只在地球上有智慧生命？ ” 叶文洁轻轻叹息一声： “从理论上讲， 这可能是一件永远没有结论 的事，但从感觉上，我，还有每一个经历过红岸的人，都认同这点了。 ” “红岸项目被撤销真的很可惜，既然建了，就应该运作下去，这是 一项真正伟大的事业啊！ ” 地球往事 三体 129 “红岸是逐渐衰落的。上个世纪八十年代初，还进行过一次大规模 改造，主要是升级了发射和监听部分的计算机系统，发射系统实现了自 动化，监听系统引进了两台 IBM 中型计算机，数据处理能力提高了很 多，能同时监听四万个频道。但后来，随着眼界的开阔，人们也清楚了外 星文明探索的难度，上级对红岸工程渐渐失去了兴趣。最先看到的变化 是基地的密级降低了，当时普遍认为红岸如此高的保密级别是小题大 作，基地警卫兵力由一个连减少到一个班，再到后来，只剩下一个五人 保卫组了。也是在那次改造以后，红岸的编制虽然仍在二炮，科研管理 却移交到中科院天文所，于是承担了一些与外星文明搜索没有关系的 研究项目。 ” “您的很多成果就是在那时做出的。 ” “红岸系统最初是承担了一些射电天文观测项目，那时它是国内 最大的射电望远镜。后来，随着其他射电天文观测基地的建立，红岸的 研究主要集中在对太阳电磁活动的观测和分析上，为此还加装了一台 太阳望远镜，我们建立的太阳电磁活动数学模型当时在那个领域是领 先的，也有了许多实际应用。有了后来的这些研究和成果，红岸的巨额 投资总算是有了一点点回报。其实这一切有相当部分要归功于雷政委， 当然他是有个人目的的。那时他发现，在技术部队搞政工前景不太好， 他入伍前也是学天体物理学的，于是就想回到科研上来。红岸基地后来 引进的外星文明探索之外的项目，都是他努力的结果。 ” “回到专业上哪儿有那么容易？那时您还没有平反，我看他更多是 将您的成果署上自己的名吧？ ” 叶文洁宽容地笑笑： “没有老雷，红岸基地早就完了。红岸被划到 了军转民范围内后，军方就把它完全放弃了，中科院维持不起基地的运 行费用，一切就都结束了。 ” 叶文洁没有多谈她在红岸基地的生活，汪淼也没有问。进入基地后 的第四个年头，她与杨卫宁组成了家庭，一切都是自然而然发生的，很 平淡。后来，在基地的一次事故中，杨卫宁和雷志成双双遇难，杨冬作为 中国科幻基石丛书 130 遗腹子生了下来。她们母女一直到上世纪八十年代中红岸基地最后撤销 时才离开雷达峰，叶文洁后来在母校教授天体物理，直到退休。这一 切汪淼都是在密云射电天文基地听沙瑞山说的。 “外星文明探索是一个很特殊的学科，它对研究者的人生观影响 很大。 ” 叶文洁用一种悠长的声调说， 像是在给孩子讲故事， “夜深人静 的时候，从耳机中听着来自宇宙没有生命的噪声，这噪声隐隐约约的， 好像比那些星星还永恒；有时又觉得那声音像大兴安岭的冬天里没完 没了的寒风，让我感到很冷啊，那种孤独真是没法形容。 “有时下夜班，仰望夜空，觉得群星就像发光的沙漠，我自己就是 一个被丢弃在沙漠上的可怜孩子……我有那种感觉：地球生命真的是 宇宙中偶然里的偶然，宇宙是个空荡荡的大宫殿，人类是这宫殿中唯一 的一只小蚂蚁。这想法让我的后半辈子有一种很矛盾的心态：有时觉得 生命真珍贵，一切都重如泰山；有时又觉得人是那么渺小，什么都不值 一提。反正日子就在这种奇怪的感觉中一天天过去，不知不觉人就老了 ……” 对于这个为孤独而伟大的事业贡献了一生的可敬的老人，汪淼想 安慰几句，但叶文洁最后一席话使他陷入了同样悲凉的心境，他什么也 说不出来，只是说： “叶老师，哪天我陪您再去红岸基地遗址看看。 ” 叶文洁缓缓摇摇头： “小汪，我和你不一样啊，岁数大了，身体也不 好，什么都难预料，以后也就是过一天算一天吧。 ” 看着叶文洁满头的银发，汪淼知道，她又想起了女儿。,"1 4 R e d C o a s t I V “Professor Y e,” W ang Miao said , “I have a question. Back then, SETI was mar ginalized research. Why did the Red Coast Project have such a high security rating?” “That question was asked during the very first phases of the Red Coast Project, and continued to be ask ed until the end. But now you should know the answer . W e can only be imp ressed by the foresight of the top decision- maker responsible for the Red Coast Project.” “Y es, he thought far ahead.” W ang nodded gravely . W ang knew that it was only within the last couple of years tha t serious and systematic consideration had been given to the question of how and to what degree human societies would be influenced by establishing contact with extraterrestrial intelligence, but the research had rapidly gained interest, and the conclusions were shocking. Nave, idealistic hopes had been shattered. Scholars found that, contrary to the happy wishes of most pe ople, it was not a good idea for the human race as a whole to make contac t with extraterrestrials. The impact of such contact on human society would be divisive rather than uniting, and would exacerbate rathe r than mitigate the conflicts between dif ferent cultures. In summary , if contact were to occur , the internal divisions within Earth civilization would be magnifie d and likely lead to disaster . The most shocking conclu sion of all was that the impact would have nothing at all todo w ith the deg ree and type of contact (unidirectional or bidire ctional), or the form and degree of advancement of the alien civilization. This was the theory of “contact as symbol” proposed by sociolo gist Bill Mathers of RAND Corporation in his book, The 100,000-Light-Y ear Ir on Curtain: SETI Sociology . M athers believed that contact with an alien civilization is only a symbol or a switch. Regardless of the content of the encounter , the results would be the same. Suppose that the nature of the contact is such that only the exis tence of extraterrestrial intelligence is confirmed, with no other substantive informationwhat Mathers called elementary contact. The impact would be magn ified by the lens of human mass psychology and cul ture until it resulted in huge, substantive influences on the progress of civilization. If such contact were monopolized by one country or political force, the significance would be comparable to an overwhelming advantage in economic and military power . “How did Red Coast end?” “Y ou can probably guess.” W ang nodded again. Of course he understood that, had Red Coast succeeded, the world today would be very dif ferent. T o comfort Y e, he said, “It’ s still too early to tell if it succeeded or not. The radio waves sent out by Red Coast haven’ t gone very far in the universe yet.” Y e shoo k her head. “The farth er the signals travel, the weaker they become, and the less likely that any extraterrestrial civilization will receive them. O f course , if aliens have already detected the Earth’ s exist ence and its oxygen-rich atmosphere and decided to focus powerful equipment specifically at us, the story wo uld be dif ferent. But, in gener al, research shows that in o rder for extraterrestrials to detect our signal s, we must broadcast at a power level equal to the ener gy output of a midsized star . “Soviet astrophysicist Nicolai Kardashev once proposed that civilizations can be divided into three types based on the power they can commandfor communication purposes, let’ s say . A T ype I civilization can muster a n amou nt of ener gy eq uivalent to the total ener gy ou tput of the Earth. B ased on his estimates, the ener gy output of the Earth is about 1015 to 1016 w atts. A T ype II civilization can marshal the ener gy equivalent to the output of a typical star 1026 wa tts. A T yp e III civilization’ scommunication ener gy can reach 1036 watts, approximately equal to the ener gy o utput o f a galaxy . Civi lization on Earth is currently ab out a T ype 0.7, not even a f ull T ype I. And the transmissions from Red Coa st used only about one ten-millionth of the amount of power the Earth could muster . Our call was like the buzzing of a mosquito in the sky . No one could hear it.” “But if Kardash ev’ s T ype II an d T ype III civilizations really exist, we should be able to hear them .” “W e never heard anything during the twenty years that Red Coast was in operation.” “Indeed. Given Red Coast and SETI, could all our ef forts ultimately have proven only one thing: In the entire universe, only the Earth has intelligent life?” Y e gave a light sigh. “Theoretically , there may never be a d efinitive answer t o that question. But my sense, and the sense of everyon e who went through Red Coast, is that that is the case.” “It’ s too bad that Red Coast wa s decommissioned. Once it was built, it should have been kept running. It was a truly great enterprise.” “Red Coast’ s decline was gradual. At the beginning of the eighties, there was a lar ge-scale renovation. Mainly , the transmission and monitoring computer systems were partially upgraded. The transmission system was automated, and the monitoring system incorporated two IBM minicomputers. The data processing capability became far more advanced, and it was able to simultaneously monitor forty thousand channels. “But lat er , as people gained per spective, they had a better appreciation of t he dif ficulty of the search for extraterrestrial intelligenc e, and the leadership lost interest in Red Coast. The first change was reducing the base’ s security rating. The cons ensus was that the extreme sec recy around Red Coa st was unnecessary , and the security detail at the base w as reduced from a company to a squad, until eventually only a group of five security guards were left. Also, after tha t renovation, although Red Coast remained administratively within the Second Artillery Corps, management of its scientific activities was turned over to the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Astronomy Insti tute, and it took on some research projects that had nothing to do with the search for extraterrestrial intelligence or the military .”“I be lieve you achieved most of your scientific accomplishments during that time.” “Initially , Red Coast also took on some radio astronomy projects. At the time, it was the lar gest radio telescope in the country . Later , as other radio astronomy observatories were built, Red Coast’ s research turned to the observation and analysis of solar electromagnetic activity . For this, they added a solar telescope. The mathematical model we buil t for solar electromagnetic activity was at the forefront of the field back then, and had many practical applications. W ith these later research results, the lar ge amount invested in Red Coast had at least a little return. “Actually , much of the credit s hould be given to Commissar Lei. Of course he had his own agenda. He realized that as a political of ficer in a technical unit, his future wasn’ t bright. Before joining the army , he had studied astrophysics as well, so he wanted to return to doing science. The research projects that Red Coast took on outside of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence were all due to his ef forts.” “I doubt that he could have returned to technical work so easily after spending so much time as a poli tical commissar . Back then, you still hadn’ t been politically rehabilitated. It looks to me like all he did wa s to put his name on your research results.” Y e s miled for givingly . “W ithout Lei, Red Coast Base would have been finished even earlier . After Red Coast was designated for conversion to civilian use, the military basica lly abandoned it. Eventually , the Chinese Academy of Sciences couldn’ t maintain the funds necessary for Red Coast’ s operation, and it was shut down.” Y e didn’ t talk much about her daily life at Red Coast Base, an d W ang didn’ t ask. Four years after ent ering the base, she married Y an g W eining. Everything just happened naturally , without any drama. Later , an accident at the base killed both Y ang and Lei, and Y ang Dong was born after her father ’ s death. The mother and daughter only left Radar Peak in the mid- eighties, when Red Coast Base was finally decommissioned. Y e later returned to T singhua, her alma mater , to teach astrophysics until retirement. All this W ang had heard from Sha Ruishan at the Miyun Radio Astronomy Observatory . “The search for extraterrestrial i ntelligence is a unique discipline. It has a profound influence on the researcher ’ s perspective on life.” Y e spoke in adrawn-out voice , as though telling stories to a child. “In the dead of the night, I could hear in my headph ones the lifeless noise of the universe. The noise w as faint but constant, more eternal than the stars. Sometimes I thought it sounded like the endless winter winds of the Greater Khingan Mountains. I felt so cold then, and the loneliness was indescribable. “From time to t ime, I would ga ze up at the stars after a night shift and think tha t they looked like a glo wing desert, and I myself was a poor child abandoned in the desert.… I thought that life was truly an accident among accidents in the universe. Th e universe was an empty p alace, and humankind the only ant in the entire palace. This kind of thinking infused the s econd half of my life with a conflicted mentality: Sometim es I thought life was precious, and everything was so important; but ot her times I thought humans were insignificant, and nothing was worthwhile. Anyway , my life passed day after day accompanied by this strange f eeling, and before I knew it, I was old.…” W ang wanted to comfort this ol d woman who had devoted her life to a lonely but great enterprise, but Y e’ s last speech caused him to sink into the same so rrowful mood. He found that he had nothing to say except, “Professor Y e, someday I’ll go with you to visit the ruins of Red Coast Base.” Y e slow ly shook her head. “Xiao W ang, I’m not like you.

地球往事 三体 131 16．三体、哥白尼、宇宙橄榄球、 三日凌空 从叶文洁家里出来以后，汪淼心绪难平，这两天的遭遇和红岸的故 事，这两件不相干的事纠结在一起，使世界在一夜之间变得异常陌生。 回到家后，为了摆脱这种心绪，他打开电脑，穿上 V装具，第三次 进入《三体》 。他的心态调整得很成功，当登录界面出现时，汪淼像换了 一个人似的，心中立刻充满了莫名的兴奋。与前两次不同，汪淼这次是 带着一个使命进来的，他要揭示出三体世界的秘密，他重新注册了一个 与此相称的 ID：哥白尼。 登录《三体》后，汪淼又站在那片辽阔的平原上，面对三体世界诡 异的黎明。巨大的金字塔在东方出现，但汪淼立刻发现它不是纣王和墨 子的那座金字塔了，它有着哥特式的塔顶，直插凌晨的天空，使他想起 了昨天早晨在王府井看到的罗马式教堂，但那座教堂要是放到金字塔 旁边，不过是它的一个小门亭而已。他还看到了远方许多显然是干仓的 建筑，但形状也都变成了哥特式建筑，尖顶细长，仿佛是大地长出的许 多根刺。 汪淼看到了金字塔上一个透出幽幽火光的洞门，就走了进去。洞内 的墙壁上，一排已被熏得黝黑的奥林匹斯诸神的雕像举着火炬。走进大 殿，发现这里甚至比门洞中还昏暗，只有一张长长的大理石桌上的两 枝银烛台上的蜡烛在昏昏欲睡地亮着，桌旁坐着几个人，昏暗的光线使 汪淼仅能看清他们面庞的轮廓，他们的双眼都隐藏在深眼窝的阴影中 看不到，但汪淼能感觉到聚集到他身上的目光。这些人似乎穿着中世纪 中国科幻基石丛书 132 的长袍，仔细看，还有一两个人的长袍更简洁一些，是古希腊式的。长桌 的一头坐着一个瘦高的男子，他头上戴着的金冠是大殿中除蜡烛外唯 一闪亮的东西，汪淼在蜡烛的光亮中很费力地看出，他身上的长袍与其 他人不同，是红色的。 到此汪淼确定了自己的判断：这个游戏是为每个玩家单开一个进 程，现在的欧洲中世纪副本，是软件根据他的 ID而选定的。 “你来晚了，会议已经开始很久了。 ”戴金冠穿红袍的人说， “我是 格里高利教皇。 ” 汪淼努力回忆着自己并不熟悉的欧洲中世纪史，想从这个名字推 断出这个文明进化的程度，但想到三体世界中历史的混乱，又觉得这种 努力没有多大意义。 “你改了 ID，可我们都认识你，在以前的两次文明中，你好像到东 方游历过。哦，我是亚里士多德。 ”穿古希腊长袍的人说，他有一头白色 的鬈发。 “是的， ”汪淼点点头， “我在那里目睹了两次文明的毁灭，一次毁 于严寒，一次毁于烈日。我还看到了东方的学者们为掌握太阳运行规律 而进行的伟大努力。 ” “嗤！ ”一个留着上翘山羊胡，比教皇更瘦的人在阴影中发出声音， “东方学者，企图从冥想、顿悟甚至梦游中参透太阳运行的秘密，可笑 之极！ ” “这是伽利略。 ”亚里士多德介绍说， “他主张应该从实验和观测 中认识世界，一个工匠式的思想家，但他已取得的成果我们还是不得不 正视。 ” “墨子也进行了实验和观测。 ”汪淼说。 伽利略又嗤了一声， “墨子的思想仍是东方的，他不过是披着科学 外衣的玄学家，从来就没有认真对待过自己的观测结果，就凭着主观臆 测建立宇宙的全模拟模型，可笑！可惜了那些精良的设备。我们不一样， 我们在大量观测和实验的基础上，进行严密的推论，建立起宇宙的模 地球往事 三体 133 型，再返回实验和观测去检验它。 ” “这是正确的， ”汪淼点点头， “这正是我的思想方法。 ” “你是不是也带了份万年历？”教皇带着讥讽说。 “我没有万年历，只带来了以观测数据为基础而建立的宇宙模型， 不过要说明，即使这个模型是正确的，也不一定能凭借它掌握太阳运行 的精确规律，编撰万年历。但这毕竟是必须走的第一步。 ” 几声孤单的掌声在阴冷的大殿中回荡，这掌声是伽利略的。 “很 好，哥白尼，很好，你这种现实的、符合实验科学思想的想法是大多数学 者不具备的，就凭这一点，你的理论也值得听一听。 ” 教皇对汪淼点点头， “说说看吧。 ” 汪淼走到长桌的另一端，让自己镇定了一下，说： “其实很简单：太 阳的运行之所以没有规律，是因为我们的世界中有三颗太阳，它们在相 互引力的作用下，做着无法预测的三体运动。当我们的行星围绕着其中 的一颗太阳做稳定运行时，就是恒纪元；当另外一颗或两颗太阳运行到 一定距离内，其引力会将行星从它围绕的太阳边夺走，使其在三颗太阳 的引力范围内游移不定时，就是乱纪元；一段不确定的时间后，我们的 行星再次被某一颗太阳捕获，暂时建立稳定的轨道，恒纪元就又开始 了。这是一场宇宙橄榄球赛，运动员是三颗太阳，我们的世界就是球！ ” 昏暗的大殿中响起了几声干笑。 “烧死他。 ”教皇无表情地说，站在 门前的两个身穿锈迹斑斑的全身铠甲的士兵立刻像两个笨拙的机器人 一般朝汪淼走来。 “烧吧。 ”伽利略叹息着摆摆手， “本来对你抱有希望，原来只不过 又是一个玄学家或巫师。 ” “这种人现在已经成了公害。 ”亚里士多德同意地点点头。 “总得让我把话说完吧！ ”汪淼推开抓他的那两个士兵的铁手套。 “你见过三颗太阳吗？或者是有别人见过？”伽利略偏着头问道。 “每个人都见过。 ” “那么，除了这个在乱纪元和恒纪元里出现的太阳外，另外两个在 中国科幻基石丛书 134 哪里？” “首先要说明，我们在不同时间看到的可能并不是同一颗太阳，而 是三颗中的一个。另外两颗太阳就是飞星，当它们运行到远距离时，看 起来像星星。 ” “你缺乏起码的科学训练。 ”伽利略不以为然地摇摇头， “太阳是 连续运行到远距离的，不可能跳跃过去，所以按你的假设，应该还有第 三种情况：太阳比正常状态小，但比飞星大，它应该在运行中逐渐变成 飞星大小，但我们从来没有看到过这样的太阳。 ” “你既然受过科学训练，就应该在观测中对太阳的结构有一些了 解。 ” “这是我最引以为自豪的发现：太阳是由深厚但稀薄的气态外层 和致密灼热的内核构成的。 ” “很对，但你显然没有发现太阳的气态外层与我们行星大气层间 奇特的光学作用。这是一种类似于偏振的现象，使得在太阳超出一定的 距离时，从我们的大气层里观察，太阳的气态外层突然变得透明不可 见，只能看到它的发光内核，这时，太阳在我们的视野中就突然缩到内 核大小，变成了飞星。正是这个现象，迷惑了历史上各个文明的研究者， 使他们没有意识到三个太阳的存在。现在你们明白了，为什么三颗飞星 的出现预示着漫长的严寒，因为这时三颗太阳都在远方。 ” 出现了短暂的沉默，大家都在思考。亚里士多德首先发言： “你缺 乏起码的逻辑训练。不错，我们是有可能看到三颗飞星，并且它们的出 现总是伴随着毁灭性的严寒。但按照你的理论，我们还应该有可能看到 三颗正常大小的太阳，这是从来没有发生过的事，在所有文明留下来的 记载中，从来没有发生过！ ” “等等！ ”一个戴着形状奇怪的帽子、留着长须的人第一次站起来 说话， “历史好像有记载，有一个文明见到过两颗太阳，那次文明立刻 毁灭于双日的烈焰中，但这记载很模糊。哦，我是达芬奇。 ” “我们说的是三颗太阳，不是两颗！ ”伽利略喊道， “按他的理论， 地球往事 三体 135 三颗太阳一定会出现的，就像三颗飞星一样！ ” “三颗太阳出现过， ”汪淼镇定地说， “也有人看到过，但看到它们 的人不可能将信息流传下来，因为当他们看到这伟大的景象时，最多只 能再活几秒钟，不可能逃脱并幸存下来。 ‘三日凌空’是三体世界最恐 怖的灾难，那时，行星地表会在瞬间变成冶炼炉，高温能够熔化岩石。在 ‘三日凌空’中毁灭的世界，要经过漫长的时间才能重现生命和文明， 这也是没有历史记载的原因。 ” 沉默，所有的人都看着教皇。 “烧死他。 ”教皇温和地说，他脸上的笑汪淼有些熟悉，那是纣王的 笑。 大殿里立刻活跃起来，大家好像遇到了什么喜事。伽利略等人兴高 采烈地从阴暗的一角搬出一具十字火刑架，他们将架上一具焦黑的尸 体取下来扔到一边，将火刑架竖起来，另一些人则兴奋地堆木柴。只有 达芬奇对这一切无动于衷。坐在桌边思考着，不时用笔在桌面上计算 着什么。 “布鲁诺， ”亚里士多德指指那具焦尸说， “曾在这里和你一样胡 扯一通。 ” “用文火。 ”教皇无力地说。 两个士兵用耐火的石棉绳将汪淼绑到火刑柱上，汪淼用还能动的 一只手指着教皇说： “你肯定是个程序，至于你们其他人，不是程序就 是白痴，我还会登录回来的！ ” “你回不来了，在三体世界中你将永远消失。 ”伽利略怪笑着说。 “那你肯定也是个程序了，一个正常人不可能连这点儿网络常识 都没有，这里最多记下我的 MAC号，换台电脑换个 ID上就行了，到时 候我会宣布自己是谁的。 ” “系统已通过 V装具记下了你的视网膜特征。 ”达芬奇抬头看了 汪淼一眼说，然后埋头继续自己的演算。 汪淼突然感到了一阵莫名的恐惧，喊道： “你们不要这样！放我下 中国科幻基石丛书 136 去！我说的是真理！ ！ ” “如果你说的是真理，就不会被烧死了，游戏对走对路的人是一路 放行的。 ”亚里士多德狞笑着，掏出一个银色的 Zippo打火机，耍了一个 复杂的把戏，锵的一声打着了火。 就在他伸手在柴堆上点火时，一道红色的强光从门洞射入，接着涌 入一股挟带着烟尘的热浪，一匹马穿透强光跑进大殿，马的躯体在熊熊 燃烧，已成了一团火球，奔跑时火焰呼呼作响。马上骑着一个人，是一位 穿着重铠的中世纪骑士，他的盔甲已被烧得通红，奔跑时拖着一股白 烟。 “世界刚刚毁灭！ ！世界刚刚毁灭！ ！脱水！ ！脱水！ ！ ”骑士狂呼着， 燃烧的坐骑扑通一声栽倒在地，成了一大堆篝火。骑士被甩出好远，一 直滚到火刑架下，红炽的盔甲一动不动，只有浓浓的白烟不断地冒出。 从盔甲中流出的人油燃烧着在地上扩散开来，仿佛盔甲长出了一对火 的翅膀。 大殿里的人都奔向洞门，蜂拥而出，很快消失在从门外射入的红光 中。汪淼奋力挣脱绳索，绕过燃烧的骑士和马，穿过空荡的大殿，跑过 热浪滚滚的门廊，来到外面。 大地已经像一块炉中的铁板一样被烧得通红，发出暗红色光的地 面上流淌着一条条明亮的岩浆小溪，织成一张伸向天边的亮丽的火网。 红炽的大地上有无数根细长的火柱高高腾起，这是干仓在燃烧，仓中的 脱水人使火柱染上了一种奇异的蓝绿色。汪淼看到不远处有十几根同 样颜色的小火柱，这是刚从金字塔中跑出来的十几个人：教皇、伽利略、 亚里士多德、达芬奇……包裹他们的蓝绿色火柱是透明的，可以看到 他们的面容和躯体在火中缓缓地变形，他们把目光聚焦在刚出来的汪 淼身上，都保持着同一个姿势，向着天空举起熊熊燃烧的双臂，用歌唱 般的声音齐声颂道： “三日凌空” 汪淼抬头望去，看到三轮巨大的太阳在天空中围绕着一个看不见 地球往事 三体 137 的原点缓缓地转动着，像一轮巨大的风扇将死亡之风吹向大地。几乎占 据全部天空的三日正在向西移去，很快有一半沉到了地平线之下。 “风 扇”仍在旋转，一片灿烂的叶片不时划出地平线，给这个已经毁灭的世 界带来一次次短暂的日出和日落，日落后灼热的大地发出暗红的光芒， 转瞬而来的日出又用平射的强光淹没了一切。三日完全落下之后，大地 上升腾的水蒸气形成的浓云仍散射着它的光芒，天空在燃烧，呈现出一 种令人疯狂的地狱之美。当这毁灭的晚霞最后消失，云层中只有被大地 的地狱之火抹上的一层血红时，几行大字出现了： 183号文明在“三日凌空”中毁灭了，该文明进化至中世纪层次。 漫长的时间后，生命和文明将重新启动，再次开始在三体世界中命 运莫测的进化。 但在这次文明中，哥白尼成功地揭示了宇宙的基本结构，三体文明 将产生第一次飞跃，游戏进入第二级。 欢迎您登录第二级《三体》 。,"1 5 T h r e e B o d y : C o p e r n i c u s , U n i v e r s a l F o o t b a l l , a n d T r i - S o l a r D a y After leaving Y e’ s home, W ang Miao couldn’ t calm down. Th e events of the l ast t wo day s and the history of Red Coast, two seemingly unconnected strands, now twisted together , made the world unfamiliar overnight. Once he was home, in order to escape this mood, W ang turned on the computer , put on the V -suit, and logged on to Thr ee Body for the third time. The attempt to a djust his state of mind worked. By the time th e log-in screen appeared , W ang seemed like a dif ferent person, one filled with an unexplainable excitement. Unlike the first two times, this time W ang came with a purpose: He was going to reveal the secret of the wor ld of Thr ee Body . He created a new log-in ID appropriate for his new role: Copernicus. * * * Once logged in, W ang again stood on that broad, desolate plain, facing the strange dawn of the world of Thr ee Body . A colossal pyr amid appeared in the east, but rig ht away W ang k new it was no longer the pyramid of King Zhou of Shang or Mozi. It had a Gothic-style apex, stabbing straight into the mor ning sky , recalling St. J oseph’ s Church at W angfujing. But if that church w ere placed next to this pyramid, it would be nothing more than an entrance booth. He saw many bu ildings in the distance that were apparentlydehydratories, but also now built in the Gothic style, with tall, sharp steeples, as though the ground had grown numerous spikes. W ang s aw a door on the side of the pyramid, lit from w ithin by flickering lights . He walked over . Inside the tunnel was a row o f statues of the gods of Ol ympus holding up torches, their surfaces blackened by smoke. He entered the Great Hall and saw that it was even dimmer than the entrance tunnel. T wo silver candelabra on top of a long marble table provided a drowsy light. Several men were seated around the table. The dim light allowed W ang to see only the outlines of their faces. Their eyes were hid den in the shadows of their deep eye sockets, but W ang could still feel their gazes focusing on him. The men seemed to be dressed in medieval robes. On closer examinat ion, one or two of them had simpler robes , more like Classical Greek chitons. At one end of the table was a thin, tall man. The golden c rown on top of his head was the only thing that glittered in the Great H all other than the candles. W ith some ef fort, W ang saw by the dim candlelight that his robe was dif ferent from the others’: it was red. W ang realized that the game displayed a distinct world for each player . This world, based on the European High Middle Ages, was chosen by the software based on his ID. “Y ou’re late. The meeting has been going on for a while,” th e gold- crowned, red-robed man said. “I’m Pope Gregory .” W ang tried to r ecall what little he knew of European history in the Middle Ages so that he could deduce the level of advancement of this civilization bas ed on the name. But then he remembered how wildly anachronistic historical references could be in the world of Thr ee Body and decided the ef fort wasn’ t worth it. “I’m Aristotle. Y ou changed your ID, but we all recognize you. In the previous two civilizations, you traveled to the East.” The spea ker was the man with the Greek chiton. He had a head of white curls. “Y es.” W ang nodded. “There, I witnessed the destruction of two civilizations, on e by extreme cold, another by a blazing sun. I a lso saw the great ef f orts the scholars of the East expended in trying to mas ter the laws governing the sun’ s motion.” “Ha!” The sound came from a man with a goatee that curled upward. He was even thinner than the pope . “Eastern scholars tried to und erstand thesecrets of the sun’ s motion through meditation, epiphany , or even dreams. Utterly laughable!” “This is Galileo, ” said Aristotle. “He advocates understanding the world through observa tion and experiment. He is an unimaginative thinker , but his results demand our attention.” “Mozi also conducted experiments and observation,” W ang said. Galileo snorted. “Mozi’ s way of thinking was still Eastern. He was nothing more than a mystic dre ssed as a scientist. He never took his own observation dat a seriously , and he constructed his model based on subjective specu lation. Ridiculo us! I feel sorry for his refined equipment. W e’re dif ferent. Based on lar ge amounts of observational data and experiments, we make strict, logical deductions to build a m odel of the universe. Then we go back to experimentation and observation to test it.” “That’ s correct.” W ang nodded. “That’ s also my way of thinking.” “Have you brought a calendar as well, then?” The pope’ s tone was mocking. “I don’ t have a calendar . I only brought a model built upon observation data. But I mus t make it clear that even if the model is correct, it’ s not certain that by using it one can master the precise details o f the sun’ s motion and create a calendar . However , it’ s a necessary step.” A few lonely c laps echoed throughout the Great Hall. The a pplause came from Galileo. “Excellent, Copernicus, excellent. Y our pragmatic way of th inking, adapted to the expe rimental, scientific approach, i s lacking in most scholars. Based on this alone, your theory is worth listening to.” The pope nodded at W ang. “Go ahead.” After ca lming h imself and walking to the other end of the lon g table, W ang sa id, “It’ s actually pretty simple. The reason why the sun’ s motion seems p atternless is because our world has three suns. Under the influence of their mutually perturbing gravitational attraction, their movements are unpredictablethe three-body problem. When our planet revo lves around one of the suns in a stable orbit, that’ s a Stable Era. When one or more of the other suns m ove within a c ertain distance, their gravitation al pull will snatch the planet away from the sun it’ s orbiting, causing it to wander unstably through the gravitational fields of the three suns. That’ s a Chaotic Era. After an uncertain amount of time, our planet is once again pulled into a temporary orbit and another S table Era begins. This is a football game atthe scale of the universe. The p layers are the three suns, and our planet is the football.” A few hollow laughs rang out in the Great Hall. “Burn him to death,” the pope said impassively . The two soldiers standing at the door in rusty armor started toward W ang like two clumsy robots. “Burn him.” Galileo sighed. “I had hopes for you, but you’re nothing more than another mystic or warlock.” “Such men are a public nuisance,” Aristotle agreed. “At least let me finish!” W ang shoved away the iron gauntlets of the two soldiers. “Have you seen three suns? Or know anyone who has?” Galileo asked. “Everyone has seen them.” “Then, other than the sun that a ppears during Chaotic Eras and Stable Eras, where are the other two?” “The sun that we see at dif ferent times may not be the same: It’ s only one of the three suns. When the other two are far away , they look like flying stars.” “Y ou lac k basic scientific training,” Galileo said, shaking his head. “The sun must move continuously t o a distant spot. It cannot jump over the intervening spac e. According to your hypothesis, there should be another observable situation: The sun must get smaller than it usually appears but bigger than a flying star , and gradually shrink into a flying star as it moves farther away . But we’ve never seen the sun behave that way .” “Since you have scientific traini ng, you ought to have some knowledge of the sun’ s structure.” “That’ s my proudest discover y . The sun is made of a sparse but expansive gaseous outer layer and a dense and hot inner core.” “V ery true,” said W ang. “But you apparently haven’ t discov ered the special o ptical interaction betw een the sun’ s gaseous outer layer and our planet’ s atmosphere. It’ s a phenomenon akin to polarization or destructive interference. As a result, when we view the sun from within our atmosphere and it gets a ce rtain distance from us, the gaseous outer lay er suddenly becomes compl etely transparent and invisible, and all we can see is its bright in ner core . The sun then appears to be only the size of the inner core, a flying star .“This phenomenon has confused every researcher in every civilization throughout history , and prevent ed them from discovering the existence of the thre e suns. Now you under stand why the appearance of three flying stars her alds a long period of e xtreme cold: because all three suns are far away .” A b rief silence followed as eve ryone pondered this. Aristotle was the first to speak. “Y ou lack basic training in logic. It’ s true that we can sometimes see three flying stars, and that’ s always accompanied by destructive periods of extreme cold. But based on your theory , we should also som etimes see three normal-sized suns in the sky . This has never happened. In all the records of all the civilizations, this has never occurred!” “W ait!” A man wearing a strangely shaped hat and a long bea rd stood up a nd s poke for the first time. “ I’m Leonardo da V inci. There m ay be such historical record s. One civilization saw two suns and was immediately destroyed by their combined heat, but the record was very vague.” “W e’re t alking about three suns, not two!” Galileo shouted. “Ac cording to his theory , three suns must appear sometime, just like three flying stars.” “Three suns have appeared,” W ang said, utterly calm. “And people have seen them. But t hose who saw s uch a great sight could not leave behind any information about them because seeing three suns would mean that they had at most a few seconds left to liv e. They had no chance to escape or survive. T ri-solar days are the most terr ifying catastrophes for our world. On such days, the surface of the planet would turn into a smelting furnace in a second, and the heat would be enough to melt rocks. After the destruction caused b y a tri-solar day , an eon would pass before the reappearance of life and civilization. This is yet another reason why there’ s no historical record of them.” Silence. Everyone stared at the pope. “Burn h im,” the pope said, gen tly . The smile on his face was a little familiar to W ang: the smile of King Zhou of Shang. The Gre at Hall came alive, and everyone seemed to be preparing for a celebration. Gal ileo and some o thers joyfully carried a stake o ut of a dark corner . T hey pu lled of f the cha rcoal-black body still tied to th e stake and cast it aside be fore fastening it in an upright position. An other group happily piled firewood around the stake. Only Leonardo ignored thecommotion. He sat at the table, pondering, and occasionally us ing a pen to calculate something on the table. “Giordano Bruno,” Aristotle sai d, pointing at the blackened body . “Like you, he came here and spewed nonsense.” “Use a low fire,” the pope said, his voice weak. T wo sol diers sta rted to tie W ang Miao to the stake using asbestos ropes. W ang used the hand that was still free to point at the pope. “Y ou are nothing more than a program. As for the rest of you, you’re either p rograms or idiots. I will log back on!” “Y ou cannot return. Y ou will disappear forever from the world of Thr ee Body .” Galileo cackled. “Then you must be a program. A normal person would certainly understand the basics of the Internet. The most the game can do is record my MAC address. I can just switch computers and create a new ID. I’ll announce myself when I’m back.” “The system has recorded your retinal scan through the V -suit,” Leonardo said, looking up at W ang. Then he returned to his calculations. W ang Miao was seized by a nameless terror . He shouted, “Don’ t do this! Let me go! I’m telling the truth!” “If you’re telling the truth, then you won’ t be burnt to death. The game rewards those who are on the right path.” As Aristotle grinned, he took out a silver Zippo lighter , flipped it in his hand in a complicated fashion, and then flicked it on. As he was about to light the fir ewood piled around W ang, a bright red light fill ed the entrance tunnel, followed by a wave of heat an d smoke. A horse dashed out of the light and into the Great Hall. Its body was already on fire, and as it galloped, the wind whipped it into a ball of flames. The rider , a knight in heavy armor th at glowed red from the heat, dragged a line of white smoke behind him. “The wo rld has ended! The world has ended! Dehydrate! Deh ydrate!” As t he k night shouted, the animal under him fell down and tu rned into a bonfire. The knight was thrown some distance and rolled all the way to the stake, where he stopped moving. White smoke continued to pour out of openings in the armor . The sizzling grease from the dead man i nside oozed out on the ground and caught fire, giving the armor a pair of burning wings.Everyone in the Great Hall str eamed toward the entrance tunnel and squeezed into it, disappearing in the red light from outside. W ang Miao struggled with all his strength until he was freed from the ropes. He dodged the b urning knight and horse, dashed through the empty Great Hall, and ran down the sweltering tunnel until he emer ged outside. The gro und glo wed red like a piece of iron in a blacksmith’ s furnace. Bright ri vulets o f lava snaked across the dim red earth, forming a net of fire that stretched to the horizon. Co untless thin pillars of flame erupted toward the sky: The dehydratories were burning. The dehydrated bodies inside gave the fire a strange bluish glow . Not far from him, W ang saw a d ozen or so small pillars of flame of the same co lor . These were the peop le who had just run out of the pyramid: the pope, Galileo, Aristotle, and Le onardo. The fiery pillars around them were translucent blue , and he could see their faces and bodies slowly deforming in the flame. They focused their gazes on W ang, who had ju st emer ged. Holding the same pose and liftin g their arms toward the sky , they chanted in unison, “T ri-solar day” W ang looked up and saw three g igantic suns slowly spinning around an invisible origin, like an immense three-bladed fan blowing a d eadly wind toward the world below . The three suns took up almost the entire sky , and as they drifted toward the west, half of the formation sank below the horizon. The giant fan continued to spin, a bright blade occasionally shooting above the horizon to give the dying world another brief sunrise and sunset. After a sunset, the ground glowed dim red, and th e sunrise a moment later flooded everything with its glaring, parallel rays. Once the three suns had completely set, the thick clouds that had formed from all the evaporated water still reflected their glow . The sky burned, displaying a hellish, maddening beauty . After the last light of destruction finally disappeared and the clouds only glowed with a f aint red luminescence reflected from the hellish fire on the ground, a few lines of giant text appeared: Civilization Number 183 was destroyed by a tri-solar day . This civilization had advanced to the Middle Ages.After a long time, life and civilization will begin again, and progress once more through the unpredictable world of Thr ee Body . But in this civilizati on, Copernicus successfully revealed the basic structure of t he universe. The civilization of Thr ee Body wi ll take i ts first leap. The game has now entered the second level. W e invite you to log on to the second level of Thr ee Body ."
中国科幻基石丛书 138 17．三体问题 汪淼刚刚退出游戏，电话响了，是大史打来的，说有紧急的事情，让 他马上到重案组办公室去一趟，汪淼看看表，已是凌晨三点了。 汪淼来到大史凌乱的办公室时，见那里已被他抽得云蒸雾绕，使得 在办公室中的另一位年轻女警不停地用记录本在鼻子前扇动。大史介 绍说她叫徐冰冰，计算机专家，是信息安全部门的。办公室中的第三个 人令汪淼很吃惊，居然是申玉菲的丈夫魏成，头发乱蓬蓬的，他抬头看 看汪淼，好像已经忘记了他们见过面。 “不好意思打扰，不过我看你也没睡吧。这里有些事儿，还没有汇 报作战中心，大概需要你参谋参谋。 ”大史对汪淼说，然后转向魏成， “你说吧。 ” “我说过，我的生命受到威胁。 ”魏成说，脸上却是一副木然的表 情。 “从头说起吧。 ” “好，从头说，不要嫌我麻烦，我最近还真想找人说说话……”魏成 说着转头看看徐冰冰， “不做笔录什么的吗？ ” “现在不用，以前没人和你说话？ ”大史不失时机地问。 “也不是。我懒得说，我是个懒散的人。 ” 以下是魏成的叙述： 我是个懒散的人，从小就是，住校时碗从来不洗，被子从来不叠，对 什么都提不起兴趣，懒得学习，甚至懒得玩，每天迷迷糊糊地混日子。但 地球往事 三体 139 我知道自己有一些超过常人的才能，比如你画一根线，我在线上划一 道，位置肯定在 0.618的黄金分割处。同学们说我适合当木匠，但我觉得 这是更高级的才能，是对数和形的一种直觉。其实我的数学同其他课程 一样，成绩一团糟，我懒得推导，考试时就将自己蒙出来的答案直接写 上去，也能蒙对百分之八九十，但这样拿不到高分。 高二时，一位数学老师注意到了我，那时候，中学教师中可是卧虎 藏龙， “文革”中很多有才华的人都流落到中学去教书了，他就是这样 一个人。有一天下课后他把我留下，在黑板上写了十几个数列，让我直 接写出它们的求和公式。我很快写出其中的一部分，基本上都对，其余 我一眼就看出是发散的。老师拿出了一本书，是《福尔摩斯探案集》 ，他 翻到一篇，好像是《红字的研究》吧，有一段大意是这样：华生看到楼下 有个衣着普通的人在送信，就指给福尔摩斯看，福尔摩斯说你是指那个 退伍海军军曹吗？华生很奇怪福尔摩斯是如何推断出他的身份的，福尔 摩斯自己也不清楚，想了半天才理出推理的过程，看那人的手、举止啦 等等。他说这不奇怪，别人也很难说出自己是如何推断出“ 2+2=4”的。 老师合上书对我说：你就是这样，你的推导太快了，而且是本能的， 所以自己意识不到。他接着问我：看到一串数字，你有什么感觉？我是问 感觉。我说任何数字组合对于我都是一种立体形体，我当然说不清什么 数字是什么形状，但它确实表现为一种形体。那看到几何图形呢？老师 追问。我说与上面相反，在我脑袋深处没有图形，一切都化为数字了，就 像你凑近了看报纸上的照片，都是小点儿（当然现在的报纸照片不是 那样儿了） 。 老师说你真的很有数学天分，但是，但是……他说了好多个但是， 来回走着，好像我是个很棘手的东西，不知道如何处理似的。但是你这 号人不会珍惜自己天分的，他说。想了好半天，他好像放弃了，说那你就 去参加下月区里的数学竞赛吧，我也不辅导你了，对你这号人，白费劲， 只是你答卷时一定要把推导过程写上去。于是我就去竞赛了，从区里一 直赛上去，赛到布达佩斯的奥林匹克数学竞赛，全是冠军。回来后就被 中国科幻基石丛书 140 一所一流大学的数学系免试录取了…… 我说这些你们不烦吧？啊，好，其实要说清后面的事儿，这些还是必 须说的。那个高中老师说得对，我不会珍稀自己，本科硕士博士都吊儿 郎当，但居然都过来了。一到社会上，才发现自己是个地地道道的废物， 除了数学啥也不会，在复杂的人际关系中处于半睡眠状态，越混越次； 后来到大学里教书吧，也混不下去，教学上认真不起来，我在黑板上写 一句“容易证明” ，学生底下就得捣鼓半天，后来搞末位淘汰，课也没得 教了。到此为止，我对这一切都厌倦了，就拿着简单的行李去了南方一 座深山中的寺庙。 哦，我不是去出家，我懒得出家，只是想找个真正清静的地方住一 阵儿。那里的长老是我父亲的一个老友，学问很深，却在晚年遁入空门， 照父亲说吧，到他这层次，也就这一条路了。那位长老收留我住下，我对 他说，想找个清静省心的方式混完这辈子算了。长老说，这里并不清静， 是旅游区，进香的人也很多；大隐隐于市，要清静省心，自己就得空。我 说我够空了，名利于我连浮云都算不上，你庙里那些僧人都比我有更多 的凡心。长老摇摇头：空不是无，空是一种存在，你得用空这种存在填满 自己。这话对我很有启发，后来想想，这根本不是佛家理念，倒像现代的 某种物理学理论。长老也说了，他不会同我谈佛，理由与那位中学老师 一样：对我这号人没用。 第一天晚上，在寺院的小屋里我睡不着，没想到这世外桃源是如此 的不舒服，被褥都在山雾中变潮了，床硬邦邦的。于是，为了催眠，我便 试图按长老说的那样，用“空”来填充自己：我在意识中创造的第一个 “空”是无际的太空，其中什么都没有，连光都没有，空空的。很快觉 得这空无一物的宇宙根本不能使自己感到宁静，身处其中反而会感到 一种莫名的焦躁不安，有一种落水者想随便抓住些什么东西的欲望。 于是我给自己在这无限的空间中创造了一个球体，不大的、有质量 的球体。但感觉并没有好起来，那球体悬浮在“空”的正中（对于无限 的空间，任何一处都是正中） ，那个宇宙中没有任何东西作用于它，它 地球往事 三体 141 也没有任何东西可以作用。它悬在那里，永远不会做丝毫的运动，永远 不会有丝毫的变化，真是对死亡最到位的诠释。 我创造了第二个球，与原来的球大小质量相等，它们的表面都是全 反射的镜面，互相映着对方的像，映着除它自己之外宇宙中唯一的一个 存在。但情况并没有好多少：如果球没有初始运动，也就是我的第一推 动，它们很快会被各自的引力拉到一块，然后两个球互相靠着悬在那里 一动不动，还是一个死亡的符号。如果有初始运动且不相撞，它们就会 在各自引力作用下相互围绕着对方旋转，不管你怎样初始化，那旋转最 后都会固定下来，永远不变，死亡的舞蹈。 我又引入了第三个球体，情况发生了令我震惊的变化。前面说过， 任何图形在我的意识深处都是数字化的，前面的无球、一球和二球宇宙 表现为一条或寥寥几条描述它的方程，像几片晚秋的落叶。但这第三个 球体是点上了“空”之睛的龙，三球宇宙一下子变得复杂起来，三个被 赋予了初始运动的球体在太空中进行着复杂的、似乎永不重复的运动， 描述方程如暴雨般涌现，无休无止。我就这样进入梦乡，三球在梦中一 直舞蹈着，无规律的永不重复的舞蹈。但在我的意识深处，这舞蹈是有 节奏的，只是重复的周期无限长而已，这让我着迷，我要描述出这个周 期的一部分或全部。 第二天我一直在想着那三个在“空”中舞蹈的球，思想从没有像这 样全功率转动过，以至于有僧人问长老我精神是不是出了什么毛病，长 老一笑说：没事，他找到了空。是的，我找到了空，现在我能隐于市了，就 是置身熙攘的人群中，我的内心也是无比清静。我第一次享受到了数学 的乐趣，三体问题 ① 的物理原理很单纯，其实是一个数学问题。这时，我 就像一个半生寻花问柳的放荡者突然感受到了爱情。 ①三个质量相同或相近的物体在相互引力的作用下如何运动的问题，是古典物理学 的经典问题， 对天体运动研究有重要意义， 自十六世纪以来一直受到关注。 瑞士数学家欧 拉、法国数学家拉格朗日， 以及近年来一些借助于 计算机研究的学者， 都找出了三体问题 的某些特解。 中国科幻基石丛书 142 “你不知道庞加莱吗 ① ？”汪淼打断魏成问。 当时不知道，学数学的不知道庞加莱是不对，但我不敬仰大师，自 己也不想成大师，所以不知道。但就算当时知道庞加莱，我也会继续对 三体问题的研究。全世界都认为这人证明了三体问题不可解，可我觉得 可能是个误解，他只是证明了初始条件的敏感性，证明了三体系统是一 个不可积分的系统，但敏感性不等于彻底的不确定，只是这种确定性包 含着数量更加巨大的不同形态，现在要做的是找到一种新的算法。当时 我立刻想到了一样东西：你听说过‘蒙特卡洛法’吗？哦，那是一种计算 不规则图形面积的计算机程序算法，具体做法是在软件中用大量的小 球随机击打那块不规则图形，被击中的地方不再重复打击，这样，达到 一定的数量后，图形的所有部分就会都被击中一次，这时统计图形区域 内小球的数量，就得到了图形的面积，当然，球越小结果越精确。 这种方法虽然简单，却展示了数学中的一种用随机的蛮力对抗精 确逻辑的思想方法，一种用数量得到质量的计算思想。这就是我解决三 体问题的策略。我研究三体运动的任何一个时间断面，在这个断面上， 各个球的运动矢量有无限的组合，我将每一种组合看做一种类似于生 物的东西，关键是要确定一个规则：哪种组合的运行趋势是“健康的” 和“有利的” ，哪种是“不利的”和“有害的” ，让前者获得生存的优势， 后者则产生生存困难，在计算中就这样优胜劣汰，最后生存下来的就是 对三体下一断面运动状态的正确预测。 “进化算法。 ”汪淼说。 “请你来还是对了。 ”大史对汪淼点点头。 ①十九世纪法国数学家， 曾证明了三体问题在数学上不可解， 并从三体问题出发， 在 微分方程问题上创造了新的数学方法。 地球往事 三体 143 是的，我是到后来才听说这个名词。这种算法的特点就是海量计 算，计算量超级巨大，对于三体问题，现有的计算机是不行的。而当时我 在寺庙里连个计算器都没有，只有从账房讨来的一本空账本和一枝铅 笔：我开始在纸上建立数学模型，这工作量很大，很快用完了十几个空 账本，搞得管账的和尚怨气冲天。但在长老的要求下，他们还是给我找 来了更多的纸和笔。我将写好的计算稿放到枕头下面，废掉的就扔到院 里的香炉中。 这天傍晚，一位年轻女性突然闯进我屋里，这是我这里第一次有女 人进来，她手中拿着几张边缘烧焦了的纸，那是我废弃的算稿。 “他们说这是你的，你在研究三体问题？”她急切地问，大眼镜后面 的那双眼睛像着了火似的。 这人令我很震惊，我采用的是非常规数学方法，且推导的跳跃性很 大，她竟然能从几张废算稿中看出研究的对象，其数学能力非同一般。 同时也可以肯定，她与我一样，很投入地关注着三体问题。我对来这里 的游客和香客都没什么好印象，那些游客根本不知道是来看什么的，只 是东跑西窜地照相；而那些香客，看上去普遍比游客穷得多，都处于一 种麻木的智力抑制状态。这个姑娘却不同，很有学者气质，后来知道她 是同一群日本游客一起来的。 不等我回答，她又说： “你的想法太高明了，我们一直在寻找这类 方法，把三体问题的难度转化为巨大的计算量。但这需要很大的计算机 才行。 ” “把全世界所有的大计算机都用上也不行。 ”我实话告诉她。 “但你总得有一个过得去的研究环境才行，这里什么都没有。我可 以让你有机会使用巨型计算机，还可以送给你一台小型机，明天一早， 我们一起下山。 ” 她就是申玉菲了，同现在一样，简洁而专制，但比现在要有吸引力。 我生性冷淡，对女性，我比周围这些和尚更不感兴趣，但她很特殊，她那 最没女人味的女人味吸引了我，反正我也是个闲人，就立刻答应了她。 中国科幻基石丛书 144 夜里，我睡不着，披衣走进寺院，远远地，在昏暗的庙堂里看到了申 玉菲的身影，她正在佛像前烧香，一举一动都是很虔诚的样子。我轻轻 走过去，走到庙堂门槛外时，听到了她轻声念出的一句祈求： “佛祖保佑我主脱离苦海。 ” 我以为听错了，但她又诵吟了一遍： “佛祖保佑我主脱离苦海。 ” 我不懂任何宗教也不感兴趣，但确实想象不出比这更离奇的祈祷 了，不由脱口而出： “你在说什么？ ！ ” 申玉菲丝毫没有理会我的存在，仍然微闭双眼双手合什，好像在看 着她的祈求随着香烟袅袅升到佛祖那里。过了好一阵儿，她才睁开眼睛 转向我。 “去睡吧，明天早些走。 ”她说，看也不看我。 “你刚才说的‘我主’ ，是在佛教里吗？”我问。 “不在。 ” “那……” 申玉菲一言不发，快步离去，我没来得及再问什么。我一遍遍默念 着那句祈祷，越念越感觉怪异，后来有了一种说不出的恐怖感，于是快 步走到长老的住处，敲开了他的门。 “如果有人祈求佛祖保佑另一个主，这是怎么回事呢？”我问，然后 详细地说了事情的经过。 长老默默地看着自己手中的书，但显然没有读，而是在想我说的 事，然后他说： “你先出去一会儿，让我想想。 ”我转身走出门去，知道这 很不寻常。长老学识深厚，一般的关于宗教、历史和文化的问题，他都能 不假思索地立即回答。我在门外等了有一根烟的时间，长老叫我回去。 “我感觉只有一种可能。 ”他神色严峻地说。 “什么？会是什么呢？难道可能有这种宗教，它的主需要其教徒祈 求其他宗教的主来拯救？” “她的那个主，是真实存在的。 ” 地球往事 三体 145 这话让我有些迷惑： “那么……佛祖不存在吗？”话一出口我立刻 发觉失礼，赶紧道歉。 长老缓缓地摆摆手说： “我说过，我们之间谈不了佛学，佛祖的存 在是你不能够理解的存在；而她说的主，是以你能够理解的方式存在着 的……关于这事，我没能力告诉你更多了，只是劝你，别跟她走。 ” “为什么？” “我也只是感觉，觉得她背后可能有一些你我都无法想象的事 情。” 我走出长老的门，穿过寺院朝自己的住处走去，这夜是满月，我抬 头看看月亮，感觉那是盯着我看的一只银色的怪眼，月光带着一股阴森 的寒气。 第二天，我还是跟申玉菲走了 总不能在寺庙里一直住下去 吧但没有想到，接下来的几年，我过上了梦想中的生活。申玉菲实 现了她的诺言，我拥有了一台小型机和舒适的环境，还多次出国去使用 巨型计算机，不是分时使用，而是占据全部的 CPU时间。她很有钱，我 不知道她哪来这么多钱。后来我们结婚了，没多少爱情和激情，只是为 了双方生活的方便而已，我们都有各自的事情要做。对我来说，以后的 几年可以用一天来形容，日子在平静中就过去了。在那幢别墅里，我衣 来伸手饭来张口，只需专注于三体问题的研究就行了。申玉菲从不干涉 我的生活，车库里有我的一辆车，我可以开着它去任何地方，我甚至敢 肯定，自己带一个女人回家她都不在乎，她只关注我的研究。我们每天 唯一交流的内容就是三体问题，她每天都要了解研究的进展。 “你知道申玉菲还干些别的什么吗？”大史问。 “不就是那个‘科学边界’嘛，她成天就忙那个，每天家里都来很 多人。 ” “她没有拉你加入学会吗？ ” “从来没有，她甚至没对我谈过这些，我也不关心，我就是这么个 中国科幻基石丛书 146 人，不愿意关心更多的事。她也深知这点，说我是个没有任何使命感的 懒散之人，那里不适合我，反而会干扰我的研究。 ” “那么三体研究有进展吗？”汪淼问。 以目前世界上这个研究领域的一般状况来看，进展可以说是突破 性的。前些年，加利福尼亚大学的理查德蒙特哥马利和巴黎第七大学 的桑塔克鲁兹、阿连尚斯那，还有法国计量研究机构的研究人员，用 一种叫做“逼近法”的算法，找到了三体运动的一种可能的稳定形态： 在适当的初始条件下，三体的运行轨迹将形成一个首尾衔接的 8字形。 后来人们都热衷于寻找这种特殊的稳定状态，找到一个就乐得跟什么 似的，到目前为止也就是找到了三四种。其实，我用进化算法已经找到 了一百多种稳定状态，把那些轨迹画出来，足够办一个后现代派画展 了。但这不是我的目标，三体问题的真正解决，是建立这样一种数学模 型，使得三体在任何一个时间断面的初始运动矢量已知时，能够精确预 测三体系统以后的所有运动状态。这也是申玉菲渴望的目标。 但平静的生活到昨天就结束了，我遇到了麻烦事。 “这就是你要报的案了吧？ ”大史问。 “是的，昨天有个男人来电话，说如果我不立刻停止三体问题的研 究，就杀了我。 ” “那人是谁？ ” “不知道。 ” “电话号码？ ” “不知道，我那个电话没有来电显示。 ” “其他有关情况呢？ ” “不知道。 ” 大史笑着扔了烟头， “前面扯了那么一大通， 最后要报的就这一句 话和几个不知道？ ” 地球往事 三体 147 “我不扯那一大通，这一句话你听得懂吗你？再说要是就这点事儿 我也不会来，我这人懒嘛。今天夜里，哦，当时是半夜了，我也不知道是 昨天还是今天，我睡着，迷迷糊糊感到脸上有凉凉的东西在动，睁开眼 看到了申玉菲，真吓死我了。 ” “半夜在床上看到你老婆有什么可怕的？ ” “她用那种眼光看我，从来没有过的那种眼光，外面花园的灯光照 到她脸上，看上去像鬼似的。她手里拿着一个东西，是枪！她把枪口在我 脸上蹭，说我必须把三体问题的研究进行下去，不然也杀了我。 ” “嗯，有点儿意思了。 ”大史又点上一枝烟，满意地点点头。 “什么叫有意思？你们看，我没地方可去了，才来找你们。 ” “你把她对你说的话照原样说说。 ” “她是这么说的：如果三体问题研究成功，你将成为救世主；如果 现在停止，你就是个罪人。如果有个人拯救了人类或毁灭了人类，那你 可能的功绩和罪恶，都将正好是他的一倍。 ” 大史吐出浓浓的烟雾，盯着魏成看了好一阵儿，直看得他有些不 安，然后从凌乱的桌上拖过一个本子，拿起笔。 “你不是要做笔录吗？重 复一遍刚才那话。 ” 魏成重复了一遍后， 汪淼说： “这话确实奇怪， 怎么正好是一倍呢？ ” 魏成眨眨眼对大史说： “看来这事挺严重？我来时那个值班的一见 我，就让我来找你，看来我早在这儿挂上号了。 ” 大史点点头， “再问一个事儿：你觉得你老婆那枝枪是真的吗？”看 到魏成不知如何回答，他又说， “有枪油味吗？ ” “有，肯定有油味！ ” “那好。 ”坐在桌子上的大史跳下来说， “总算找到一个机会，非法 持有枪支嫌疑，是个勉强说得过去的搜查理由，手续明天再补吧，我们 得马上行动。 ”他转向汪淼说， “这还得辛苦你跟着去再参谋参谋。 ”然 后他对一直没说话的徐冰冰说， “小徐，现在专案组里值班的只有两个 人，不够，知道你们信息处的都是金枝玉叶，但今天你这个专家得出这 中国科幻基石丛书 148 趟外勤了。 ” 徐冰冰很快点点头， 她巴不得快些离开这个烟雾腾腾的地 方。 执行这次搜查任务的除了大史和小徐，还有两名值班的刑警。加上 汪淼和魏成，一行六人分乘两辆警车，穿过黎明前最黑暗的夜色，驶向 那个城市边缘的别墅区。 徐冰冰和汪淼坐在后排，车刚开，她就低声对汪淼说： “汪老师，你 在《三体》中威望值很高。 ” 现实世界中又有人提到《三体》 ，汪淼一阵激动，感觉自己和这个 穿警服的女孩的距离一下子拉近了。 “你也玩？ ” “我负责监视和追踪它，苦差事一个。 ” 汪淼急切地说： “你能不能告诉我一些关于它的情况， 我真的很想 知道。 ” 借着车窗外透进的微弱灯光，汪淼看到徐冰冰神秘地一笑。 “我们也想知道呢，可它的服务器在境外，系统和防火墙都很严 实，不好进啊。现在知道的情况不多：它肯定是非赢利的，游戏软件的水 平很高，甚至可以说高得不正常，还有其中的信息量，您也知道，更不正 常了，这哪儿像一个游戏啊！ ” “这里面，有没有什么……”汪淼仔细地斟酌着词句， “貌似超自 然的迹象。 ” “这我们倒觉得没有，参加这个游戏编程的人很多，遍布世界各 地，开发方式很像前几年红过一阵儿的 LINUX ，但这次，肯定使用了某 种很超前的开发工具。至于那些信息，鬼才知道它们是从哪儿来的，那 可真有些……您说的超自然了，不过我们还是相信史队那句名言，这一 切肯定都是人为的。我们的追踪还是有成效的，很快会有结果。 ” 姑娘到底还是不老练，最后这句话使汪淼明白她瞒着自己许多。 “他那话成名言了？”汪淼看看前面开车的大史说。 地球往事 三体 149 到达别墅时天还没亮，别墅的上层有一个房间亮着灯，其他窗口都 黑着。 汪淼刚走下车，立刻听到了楼上发出的声音，连着几声，像是什么 东西在拍墙。刚下车的大史听到这声音后立刻警觉起来，一脚踹开虚掩 着的院门，以与他那壮硕的身躯不相称的敏捷飞速冲进别墅，他的三名 同事随后跟进。汪淼和魏成跟着进了别墅，从客厅上了二楼，走进了那 间开着门亮着灯的房间，鞋底“啪啪”地踏在了正在向外流淌的血泊 中那天夜里也是这个时候，汪淼就是在这个房间看到申玉菲在玩 《三体》现在，她平躺在房间正中，胸前的两个弹孔还在涌血，第三 颗子弹从左眉心穿入，使她的整个脸都糊在血中，在距她不远处，一枝 手枪泡在血里。 汪淼进来时，正赶上大史和他的一位男同事冲出来，进了对面一间 开着门黑着灯的房间，那房间的窗大开着，汪淼听到外面有汽车发动的 声音。一名男警察开始打电话，徐冰冰远远地站在一边紧张地看着，她 大概和汪淼他们一样，也是第一次见到这场面。大史很快回来了，一边 把枪插回胸前的套中，一边对那个打电话的同事说： “黑色桑塔纳，只有一个人，车号看不清，让他们重点封锁五环入 口，奶奶的，可能要让他溜了。 ”大史环顾四周，看到了墙上的几个弹 洞，又扫了一眼地上散落的弹壳，说， “对方开了五枪，打中三枪；她开 了两枪，都没中。 ”然后蹲下来与男同事一起检验尸体。小徐仍远远站 着，偷偷看了站在她旁边的魏成一眼，大史也抬头看了他一眼。 魏成脸上有一丝震惊，一丝悲哀，但也仅仅是一丝而已，他那固有 的木然仍没有被打破，比起汪淼来，他镇静多了。 “你好像无所谓啊，那人可能是来杀你的。 ”大史对魏成说。 魏成居然笑了一下，凄惨的笑。 “我能怎么样？到现在，对她我其实 是一无所知，我不止一次劝她把生活过得简单些，可……唉，想想当年 那夜长老劝我的话吧。 ” 大史站起来，走到魏成面前，掏出烟来点上一枝， “你总还有些情 中国科幻基石丛书 150 况没告诉我们吧？ ” “有些事，我懒得说。 ” “那你现在可得勤快些了！ ” 魏成想了想说： “今天，哦，是昨天下午，她在客厅里和一个男人吵 架，就是那个潘寒，著名的环保主义者。他们以前也吵过几次架，用的是 日语，好像怕我听到，但昨天他们什么都不顾了，说的是中国话，我听到 了几句。 ” “你尽量按原话说。 ” “好吧。潘寒说：我们这些表面上走到一起的人，实际上是处于两 个极端的敌人！申玉菲说：是的，你们借着主的力量反对人类。潘寒说： 你这么理解也不是完全没有道理，我们需要主降临世界，惩罚那些早就 该受到惩罚的罪恶，而你在阻止这种降临，所以我们势不两立，你们要 是不停止，我们会让你们停止的！申玉菲说：让你们这些魔鬼进入组织， 统帅真瞎了眼！潘寒说：说到统帅，统帅是哪一派的？降临派还是拯救 派，你说得清？潘寒这话让申玉菲沉默了好一阵儿，然后两人说话就没 那么大声激烈了，我也再没听到。 ” “电话里威胁你的那个人，他的声音像谁？ ” “你是说像潘寒吗？不知道，当时声音很小，我听不出来。 ” 又有几辆警车鸣着警笛停在了外面，一群戴着白手套拿着相机的 警察走上楼来，别墅里忙碌起来。大史让汪淼先回去休息，汪淼走到那 间有小型机的房间里找到了魏成。 “那个三体问题进化算法的模型，您能不能给我一份概要之类的 东西，我想在……一个场合介绍一下，这要求很唐突，如果不行就算 了。” 魏成拿出一个三光盘递给汪淼。 “都在这里面了， 全部的模型和 附加文档。你要是想对我好，就用自己的名字把它发表了，那真帮了我 大忙。 ” “不不，这怎么可能！ ” 地球往事 三体 151 魏成指着汪淼手中的光盘说： “汪教授， 其实以前你来的时候我就 注意到了你，你是个好人，有责任心的好人，所以，我还是劝你离这东西 远些，世界就要发生突变了，每个人能尽量平安地打发完余生，就是大 幸了，别的不要想太多，反正没用。 ” “你好像还知道更多的事？ ” “每天和她在一起，不可能什么都不知道。 ” “那为什么不告诉警方呢？ ” 魏成不屑地一笑： “嗤，警方算个狗屁，上帝来了都没用，现在全人 类已经到了‘叫天天不答，叫地地不应’的地步了。 ” 魏成站在靠东的窗边，在城市的高楼群后面的天空晨光初现，不知 为什么，这让汪淼想到了每次进入《三体》时看到的诡异黎明。 “其实我也不是那么超脱，这几天都是整夜睡不着，早上起来从这 里看到日出时，总觉得是日落。 ”他转向汪淼，沉默良久后说， “其实这 一切都在于，上帝，或她说的主，自身难保了。 ”,"1 6 T h e T h r e e - B o d y P r o b l e m As soon as W ang logged out of the game, the phone rang. It w as Shi Qiang, who said it w as ur gent that he come down to Shi’ s of fice at the Criminal Division. W ang glanced at his watch: It was three in the morning. W ang ar rived a t Da Shi’ s chao tic of fice and saw that it was already filled with a dense cloud of cigarette smoke. A young woman police of ficer who shared the of fice fanned the smoke away from her nose with a notebook. Da Shi introduced her as Xu Bingbing, a computer specialist from the Information Security Division. The thir d person in the of fice surprised W ang. It was W ei Cheng, the reclusive, myste rious husband of Shen Y ufei from the Frontiers of Science. W ei’ s hair was a mess. He looke d up at W ang, but seemed to have for gotten they had met. “I’m sorry to bo ther you, but at least it looks like you weren’ t asleep,” Da Shi said. “I have to deal wi th something that I haven’ t told the Battle Command Cent er yet, and I need your advice.” He turned to W ei Cheng. “T ell him what you told me.” “My life is in danger ,” W ei said, his face wooden. “Why don’ t you start from the beginning?” “Fine. I will. Don’ t complain a bout me being long-winded. Actually , I’ve ofte n thoug ht about talking to someone lately .…” W ei turne d to look at Xu Bingbing. “Don’ t you need to take notes or something?”“Not right now ,” Da Shi said, not missing a beat. “Y ou did n’ t have anyone to talk to before?” “No, that’ s not it. I was too lazy to talk. I’ve always been lazy .” WEI CHENG’S ST OR Y I’ve been lackadaisical since I was a kid. When I lived at boar ding school, I never washed the dishes or made the bed. I never got ex cited about anything. T oo lazy to study , too lazy to even play , I dawdled my way thr ough the days without any clear goals. But I knew that I had some special talents others lacked. For exa mple, if you dr ew a line, I could always draw another line that would divide it into the golden ratio: 1.618. My clas smates told me that I should be a carpenter , but I thought it was mor e than that, a kind of intuition about numbers and shapes. But my m ath grades wer e just as bad as my grades in other classes. I wa s too lazy to bother showing my work. On tests, I just w r ote out my guesses as answers. I got them right about eighty to ninety per cent of the time, but I still got mediocr e scor es. When I was a second-year student in high school, a math teacher noticed me. Back then, many hig h school teachers had impr essive academic cr edentials, because during the Cultural Revolution many talented scholars ended up teaching in high schools. My teacher was like that. One day , he kept me after class. He wr ote out a dozen or so nu merical sequences on the blackboar d a nd asked me to write out the summation formula for each. I wr ote out the formulas for some of t hem almost instantaneously and could tell at a glance that the r est of them wer e diver gent. My teacher took out a book, The Collected Cases of Sherloc k Holmes . He turne d to one story “A Study in Scarlet,” I think. Ther e’ s a scene in it wher e W atson sees a plainly dr e ssed messenger downstairs and points him out to Holmes. Holmes says, “Oh, you mean the r etir ed ser geant of marines?” W atson is amazed by how Holmes could deduce the man’ s history , but Holmes can’ t articu late his r easoning and has to think for a while to figur e out his chain of d eductions. It was based on the man’ s hand, his movements, and so on. He tells W atson that ther e is nothing strangeabout th is: Most people would have difficulty explaining how the y know two and two make four . My teacher closed the book and said to me, “Y ou’r e just like th at. Y our derivation is so fast and instinct ive that you can’ t even tell how you got the answer .” Then he asked me, “W hen you see a string of numbers, what do you feel? I’m talking about feelings.” I said, “Any c ombination of numbers appears to me as a thr ee- dimensional sha pe. Of course I can’ t describe the shapes of numbers, but they r eally do appear as shapes.” “Then what about when you see geometric figur es?” The teacher asked. I s aid, “It’ s just the opposite. In my mind ther e ar e no geometric figur es. Everything turns into numbers . It’ s just like if you get r eally close to a pictur e in the newspaper and everything turns into little dots.” The teacher said, “Y ou r eally ha ve a natural gift for math, but … but…” He adde d a few mor e “but”s, pacing back and forth as thou gh I was a difficult pr oblem that he didn’ t know how to handle. “But people like you don’ t cherish your gift.” After t hinking for a while, he seemed to give up, saying, “Why don’ t you sign up for the district math comp etition next month? I’m not going to tutor you. I’d just be wasting my time with your sort. But when you give your answers, make sur e to write out your derivations.” So I went to the competition. Fr om the district level up thr ough the International M athematics Olympiad in Budapest, I won first place each time. Af ter I got back, I was a ccepted by a top college’ s math pr ogram without having to go thr ough the entrance examination.… Y ou’r e n ot bor ed by my talking all this time? Ah, good. W ell, to make sense of what happened later , I have to tell you all this. That high school math tea cher was right. I didn ’ t cherish my talent. Bachelor ’ s, master ’ s, Ph.D.I never put much effort into any of them, but I did manage to get thr ough them all. However , on ce I graduated and went back to the r eal world, I r ealized that I was completely useless. Other than math, I knew nothing. I was half asleep when it came to the complexities of r elationships between people. The longer I w orked, the worse my car eer . Eventually I became a lectur er at a college, but I couldn’ t survive ther e e ither . I just couldn’ t take teaching seriousl y . I’d write on the blackboar d, “easy topr ove,” and my students would still struggle for a long while. Later , when they began to eliminate the worst teachers, I was fir ed. By t hen I was sick of everything. I packed a bag and went to a Buddhist temple deep in the mountains somewher e in southern China. Oh, I didn’ t go to become a monk. T oo lazy for that. I just wanted to find a truly peaceful place to live fo r a while. The abbot ther e was my father ’ s old frien dvery intellectual, but became a monk in his old age. The way my father to ld it, at his level, this was about the only way out. The abbot asked me to stay . I told him, “I want to find a peaceful, easy way to just muddle thr ough the r est of my life.” The abbot said, “This place isn’ t r eally peaceful. Ther e ar e lots of tourists, and many pilgrims too . The truly peaceful can find peace in a bustling city . And to attain that sta te, you need to e mpty yourself.” I said, “I ’m empty enough. Fame and fortune ar e nothing to me. Many of the monks in this temple ar e worldlie r than me.” The abb ot shook his head and said, “No, emptiness is not n othingness. Emptiness is a type of existence. Y ou must use this existential emptiness to fill yourself.” His wor ds wer e very enlightenin g to me. Later , after I thought about it a bit, I r ealized tha t it wasn’ t Budd hist philosophy at all, but was mor e akin to some mo dern ph ysics theories. The abbot also told me he wasn’ t going to discuss Buddhis m with me. His r eason was the same as my high school teacher ’ s: W ith my sort, he’d just be wasting his time. That first night, I couldn’ t sleep in the tiny r oom in the temple. I didn’ t r ealize that this r efuge fr om th e world would be so uncomf ortable. My blanket and sheet both became damp in the mountain fog, and the bed was so har d. In or der to make myself sleep, I tried to follow the abbot’ s advice and fill myself with “emptiness.” In my mind, the first “emptiness” I cr eated was the infinity o f space. Ther e was nothing in it, not ev en light. But soon I knew that this empty universe could not make me feel peace. Instead, it filled me with a nameless anxiety , like a dr owning man wanting to grab on to anything at hand. So I cr eated a spher e in this infinite space for myself: not too big, though possessing mass. My mental state didn’ t impr ove, however . The spher e f loated in the middle of “emptiness”in infinite space, anywher e could be the middle. The univer se had nothing that could act on it, and itcould act on nothing. It hung ther e, never moving, never changing, like a perfect interpr etation for death. I cr eated a seco nd spher e whose mass was equal to the first one ’ s. Both had perfectly r eflective surfaces. They r eflected each other ’ s images, displaying the only existence in the universe other than itself. But the situation didn’ t impr ove much. If the spher es had no initial movementthat is, if I d idn’ t push them at firstthey would be quickly pulled together by their ow n gravitational attraction. Then the two spher es would stay together and hang ther e without moving, a symbol for death. If they did have ini tial movement and didn’ t collide, then they would r evolve ar ound each other under the influenc e of gravity . No matter what the initial conditions, the r evolutions would eventually stabilize and become unchanging: the dance of death. I the n intr oduced a thir d spher e , and to my astonishment, the situation changed completely . Like I said, any geometric figur e turns into numbers in the depths of my mind. The spher eless, one-spher e, and two-spher e universes all showed up as a single equation or a few equations, like a few lonesome leaves in late fall. But this thir d spher e gave “emptiness” life. The thr ee spher es, given initial movements, went thr ough complex, seemingly never -r epeating movements. The descriptive equations rained down in a thunderstorm without end. Just like that, I fell asleep. The thr ee spher es continued to dance in my dr eam, a patternless, never -r epe ating dance. Y et, in the depths of my mind, the danc e did possess a r hythm; it was just that its period of r epetition was infinitely long. This mesmerized me. I wanted to describe the whole period, or at least a part of it. The next day I kept on think ing about the thr ee spher es dancing in “emptiness.” My attention had never been so completely engaged. It got to the point wher e one of the monks asked the abbot whether I was having mental health issues. The abbo t laughed and said, “Don’ t worry . He has found em ptiness.” Y es, I had fou nd emptiness. Now I could be at peace in a bustling city . Even in the mid st of a noisy cr owd, my heart would be completely tranq uil. For the first time, I enjoyed math. I felt like a libertine who has always flutter ed car elessly fr om one woman to another suddenly finding himself in love.The physics principles behind the thr ee-body pr oblem28 ar e very simple . It’ s mainly a math pr oblem. “Didn’ t you know about Henri Poincaré?” W ang Miao interru pted W ei to ask.29 At the time, I didn’ t. Y es, I know that someone studying math should know about a master l ike Poincaré, but I didn’ t worship masters and I didn’ t want to become one, so I didn’ t know his work. But even if I had, I would have continued to pursue the thr ee-body pr oblem. Everyone seems to believe that Poincaré pr oved that the thr ee-body pr oblem couldn’ t be solved, but I think they’r e mistaken. He only pr oved sensitive depend ence on initial conditions, and that the thr ee-b ody system couldn’ t be solved by integrals . But sensitivity is not the same as being completely indeterminable. It’ s just that the solution contain s a gr eater number of differ ent forms. What’ s needed is a new algorithm. Back then, I thought of one thing: Have you hear d of the Mon te Carlo method? Ah, it’ s a computer algorithm often used for calculating the ar ea of irr egular shapes. Specifically , t he softwar e puts the figur e of inter est in a figur e o f known ar ea, such as a cir cle, and randomly strikes it with many tiny balls, never tar geting the same spot twice. After a lar ge number of balls, the pr oportion of balls th at fall within the irr egular shap e compar ed to the total number of balls used to hit the cir cle will yield the ar ea of the shape. Of course, the smaller the balls used, the mor e accurate the r esult. Although the method is simple, it shows how , mathematically , random brute for ce can over come pr ecis e logic. It’ s a numerical appr oa ch that uses quantity to derive quality . This is my strategy for solving the thr ee-body pr oblem. I study the system m oment by moment. At each moment, the spher es’ motion vectors can combine in infinite ways. I tr eat each combination lik e a life form. The key is to set up some rules: which combinations of motion vectors ar e “healthy” and “beneficial,” and which combinations ar e “detrimental” and “harmful.” The former r eceive a survival advantage while the latter ar e disfavor ed. The computation pr oceeds by eliminating the disadvantaged and pr eserving the advantaged.The final combination that survi ves is the corr ect pr ediction for the system’ s next configuration, the next moment in time. “It’ s an evolutionary algorithm,” W ang said. “It’ s a good thing I invited you along.” Shi Qiang nodded at W ang. Y es. Onl y much later did I learn that term. The distinguishing featur e of this algorithm is that it r equir es ultralar ge amounts of computing power . For the thr ee-body pr oblem, the computers we have now ar en’ t enough. Back the n, in the temple, I didn’ t even have a calculator . I had to go to the accounting office to get a blank ledger and a pencil. I began to build the math model on paper . This r equir ed a lot of work, and in no time at all I went thr ough mor e than a dozen ledgers. The monks in char ge of accounts wer e an gry with me, but because the abbot wished it, they found me mor e paper an d pen. I hid the comple ted calculations under my pillow , and thr ew the scratch paper into the incense burner in the yar d. One eve ning, a young woman suddenly dashed into my r oom. This was the first time a w oman had shown up at my place. She clutched a few pieces of paper with burnt edges, the scratch paper I had thr own out. “They tell me these ar e you rs. Ar e you studying the thr ee-body pr oblem?” Behind her wide glasses, her eyes seemed to be on fir e. The woman surprised me. The math I used was unconventional, and my derivations took lar ge leaps. But the fact that she could tell th e subject of my study fr om a few pieces of s cratch paper showed that she had unusual math talent and that she, like me, was very devoted to the thr ee-body pr oblem. I did n’ t h ave a good impr ession of the tourists and pilgrims. The tourists had no idea w hat they wer e looking at, only running ar ound to snap pictur es. As for the pilgrims, they looked much poor er than the tourists, and all s eemed to b e in a state of n umbness, their intellect inhibited. But this woman was differ ent. She looked like an academic. Later I found out that she had come with a gr oup of Japanese tourists. W ithout waiting for my answer , she added, “Y our appr oach is brilliant. W e’ve been sear ching for a meth od like this that could turn the difficulty of the thr ee -body pr oblem into a matter of massive computation. O f course, it would r equir e a very powerful computer .”I t old her the tr uth. “Even if w e wer e to use all the computers in the world, it wouldn’ t be enough.” “But you must have an adequate r esear ch envir onment, and ther e’ s nothing like that her e. I can give you the use of a super computer . I can also give you a minicomputer . Let’ s leave together tomorr ow morning.” The woman, of course, was Shen Y ufei. Like now , she was concise and authoritarian, but she was mor e attractive then. I’m naturally a cold person. I had l ess inter est in women than the monks ar ound me. This woman who didn’ t adher e to conventional ideas about fem ininity was differ ent, though . She attracted me. Since I had nothing to do anyway , I agr eed right away . That night, I couldn’ t sleep. I draped a shirt over my shoulders and walked out into the yar d. In the distance, I saw Shen in the dim temple hall. She kne lt befor e the Buddha w ith lit joss sticks, and all her movements seemed full of p iety . I appr oached noiselessly , and as I came by the door to the temp le hall, I hear d her whisper a prayer: “Buddha, plea se help my Lor d br eak away fr om the sea of misery .” I thought I must have hear d wr ong, but she chanted the prayer again. “Buddha, please help my Lor d br eak away fr om the sea of misery .” I d idn’ t understa nd r eligion and had no inter est in any of them, but I r eally couldn’ t think of any prayer odder than this one. “What ar e you saying?” I blurted. Shen ign or ed me. She kept her eyes bar ely closed, her hands clasped together in fr ont of her , as though watching her prayer rise with the incense smoke to war d th e Buddha. After a long while, she finally opened her eyes and turned towar d me. “Go to sleep. W e have to get up early .” She didn’ t even look at me. “This ‘Lor d’ you mentioned, is he part of Buddhism?” I asked. “No.” “Then…?” Shen said nothing, just hurrie d away . I didn’ t get a chance to ask anything else. I r epeated the pra yer to myself over and over , and it seemed to gr ow even stranger . Eventually , I became frightened. I rushed over to the abbot’ s r oom and knocked on his door . “What d oes it mean if someone prays to the Buddha to help another Lor d?” I then told him the details of what I saw .The abbot silently looked at the book in his hand, but he was thinking about what I said, not r eading. Then he said, “Please leave me for a bit. Let me think.” I turned and left, knowing that it was unusual. The abbot was very learned. Usually , he could answer any question about r eligion, history , and cultur e without having to think. I waited outside the door for about the time it took to smoke a cigar ette, and the abbot called for me. “I think ther e’ s only one possibility .” His expr ession was grim. “What? What could it be? Could ther e be some r eligion whose god needs worshippers to pray to the gods of other r eligions to save it?” “Her Lor d r eally exists.” This r es ponse confused me. “Then … the Buddha doesn’ t exist?” As soon as I said it I r ealized how rude it sounded. I apologized. The abbot slowly waved his hand at me. “I told you, the two of us can’ t talk abo ut Buddhism. The existence of the Buddha is a kind of existence that you can not com pr ehend. But the Lor d she’ s talking about exis ts in a way that you can understand.… I ca n say no mor e concerning this matter . All I can do is counsel you against leaving with her .” “Why?” “It’ s jus t a feeling. I feel that behind her ar e things that you and I cannot imagine.” I lef t the abbot’ s r oom and walk ed thr ough the temple towar d m y r oom. The night had a full moon. I looked up at it and thought it a silvery , strange eye that gazed down at me, the light suffused with an eerie chill. The nex t day , I did leave with ShenI couldn’ t stay in the temple the r est of my life, after all. But I didn’ t think that over the next few years, I would live the life of my dr ea ms. Shen fulfilled her pr omise. I had a minicomputer and a comforta ble envir onment. I even left the country several times to use super computersnot time-sharing, but having the whole C PU to myself. She had a lot of money , though I didn’ t kn ow wher e it came fr om. Later , w e got married. Ther e wasn’ t much love or passion, just mutual convenience. W e both had thing s we wanted to get done. As for me, the few years after that could be described as a single day . My t ime passed peacefully . In her house, I was taken car e of and did not have to worry about food or c lothing, so that I could devote myself to the study of thethr ee-body pr oblem. Shen never interfer ed with my life. The garage had a car that I could drive anywher e. I’m sur e she wouldn’ t even have minded if I br ought another woman home. She only paid attention to my r esear ch, and the only thing we talked about day to day was the thr ee-body pr oblem. “Do you know what else Shen has been up to?” Shi Qiang asked. “Just the Frontiers of Science. She’ s busy with it all the time. Lots of people show up every day .” “She didn’ t ask you to join?” “Never . She never even talks to me about it. I don’ t care, either . That’ s just the way I am. I don’ t want to care about anything. She knows it, and says I’m an ind olent man without any sense of purpose. The o r ganization doesn’ t suit me and would interfere with my research.” “Have you made any progress with the three-body problem?” W ang asked. Compar ed with the general stat e of the field, my pr ogr ess could be said to be a br eakthr ough. Some years ago, Richar d Montgomery of UCSC and Alain Chenciner of Université Paris Dider ot discover ed another stable, periodic solution to the thr ee-body pr oblem.30 Un der appr opriate initial conditions, the thr ee bodies wi ll chase each other ar ound a fixed figur e- eight cu rve. After that, everyone was keen to find such special stable configurations, and every discovery was gr eeted with joy . Only thr ee or four such configurations have been found so far . But my evolutionary algorithm has alr eady discover ed mor e than a hundr ed stable configurations. D rawings of their orbits would fill a gallery with postmodern art, but that’ s not my goal. The r eal solution to the thr ee- body pr o blem is to build a mathematical model so that, given any initial configuration w ith known vectors, the model can pr edict all subsequent motion of the thr ee-body system. This is also what Shen Y ufei craves. But my peaceful life ended yester day . * * * “This is the crime you’re reporting?” Shi Qiang asked.“Y es. A man ca lled yesterday and told me that if I didn’ t ce ase my research, I would be killed.” “Who was he?” “I don’ t know .” “Phone number?” “Don’ t know . Caller ID showed nothing.” “Anything related to report?” “Don’ t know .” Da S hi l aughed and tossed his c igarette butt into an ashtray . “Y ou went on a nd on forever , and in the end all you have to report is one line and a few ‘I don’ t know’ s?” “If I hadn’ t gone on like that, would you have understood the im port of that call ? Also, if that were all, I wouldn’ t have come here. I’m lazy , remember? But there was another thing: It was the middle of the nightI don’ t know if it was today or ye sterdayand I was in bed. As I was drifting halfway between sleep and wakefulness, I felt something cold moving on my face. I opened my eyes and saw Shen Y ufei, and I almost died of fright.” “What’ s so frightening about seeing your wife in the middl e of the night?” “She stared at m e in a way that I had never seen. The light from outside fell on her face, and she looke d like a ghost. She held something in her hand: a gun! M oving the barrel over my face, she told me that I had to continue working on the three-body problem. Otherwise she’d kill me.” “Oh, now this is getting interest ing.” Da Shi gave a satisfied nod. He lit another cigarette. “Interesting? Look, I’ve nowhere to go. That’ s why I came to you.” “T ell us exactly what she said.” “She sai d: ‘If you succeed in so lving the three-body problem, you will be the savior of the world. If you stop now , you’ll be a sinner . If someone were to save or destroy the hum an race, then your possible con tribution or sin would be exactly twice as much as his.’” Da Shi blew out a thick cloud o f smoke and stared at W ei Cheng until he squir med. He pulled a notepa d out of the mess on his desk and picked up a pen. “Y ou wanted us to take notes, right? Repeat what you just said.” W ei did.W ang said, “What she said is indeed strange. What does she mean by exactly twice as much?” W ei blin ked. “This seems pretty serious. When I came, the of ficer on duty im mediately sent me to s ee you. It looks like you’ve already been paying attention to Shen and me.” Da Shi nodded. “Let me ask yo u something else: Do you think the gun your wife held was real?” He saw that W ei didn’ t know how to answer . “Could you smell gun oil?” “Y es, there was definitely an oily smell.” “Good.” Da Shi, who had been sitting on his desk, jumped of f. “Finally we have an opening. Suspected illegal possession of firearms is enough to justify a search. I’ll leave the p aperwork until tomorrow , becau se we have to move right away .” He turne d to W ang. “No rest for the weary . I have to ask you to come and adv ise me some more.” Then he turned to Xu Bingbing, who’d been silent the whole time. “Bingbin g, right now I have only two m en on duty , and that ’ s not enough. I know t he Information Security Division isn’ t used to fieldwork, but I need you to come along.” Xu nodded, glad to leave the smoke-filled of fice. * * * In additi on to Da Shi and Xu, th e team for conducting the searc h consisted of W ang Miao, W ei Cheng, a nd two other of ficers from th e Criminal Division. The six of them rode t hrough the predawn darkness in two police cars, heading toward W ei’ s neighborhood at the edge of the city . Xu and W ang w ere in the backseat. As soon as the car star ted, she whispered to W ang, “Professor W ang, your reputation in Thr ee Body is very high.” Somebody mentioned Three Body in the r eal world! W a ng w as exci ted, right away feeling close to this young woman in a police unifor m. “Do you play?” “I’m responsible for monitoring and tracking it. An unpleasant task.” W ang anxiously asked, “Can you tell me its background? I really want to know .”In th e fa int light coming through the car window , W ang saw X u give a mysterious smile. “W e want to k now as well. But all its servers are outside the c ountry . The system and firewall are very secure and hard t o penetrate. W e don’ t know much, but we can be sure it’ s not operated for profit. The software quality is uncommonly high, and the amount of information contained in it even more unusual. It doesn’ t even seem like a game.” “Have there been any…” W ang carefully picked the right wo rds. “… supernatural s igns?” W ang’ s night had been filled with coincidences: He had been called in to discuss the three-body problem with W ei Cheng immediately afte r he solved the Thr ee Body gam e. A nd now Xu was telling him she was monitoring the game. Something didn’ t seem right. “W e don’ t think so. Many from all around the world participate in the game’ s development. Their collaboration method seems similar to popular open-source practices, like the kind used to make the Linux operating system. But they’re definitely using some very advanced development tools. As for the content of the game, who knows where they’re getting it? It do es seem a bit … supernatural, like you said. However , we still believe in Captain Shi’ s famous rule: All this must be the work of people. Our tracking ef forts are ef fective, and we’ll have results soon.” The you ng woman was not experienced in lying, and her last remark made W ang rea lize that she was hiding much of the truth from him. “His ‘rule’ is famous now?” W ang looked at Da Shi, who was in the driver ’ s seat. When they reached the house, the sun had not yet risen. It was about the same time of nig ht that W ang had seen Shen playing Thr ee Body . A second- story window was lit, but all the other windows were dark. As s oon as W ang got out of the car , he heard noises coming from upstairs. It sounded like something was slapping against the w all. Da Shi, who had just gotten out of the car himself, immediately became alert. He kicked open the yard gate and rushed into the house with an agility surprising for his burly frame, his three colleagues close behind. W ang and W ei followed them into the house. They went upstairs and entered the room with a light o n, their shoes splashing in a pool of blood. Shen lay in the middle of the room, blood still oozing from two bullet wounds in her c hest. A third bullet had gone through her left br ow , causingher whole face to be covered in red. Not far from her , a gun lay i n a crimson pool. As W ang entered, Da Shi and one of the other of ficers rushed out and entered the dark room across the hall. The window there was open, and W ang heard the sound of a car starting outside. A male police o f ficer began to m ake a phon e call. Xu Bin gbing stood a little ways apar t, watching anxiously . She, like W ang and the others, had probably never seen a scene like this. A mome nt later , Da Shi returned. He put his gun back in its hol ster and said to the of ficer holding the phone, “A black V olkswagen S antana with only one man. I couldn’ t get the license plate number . T ell them to block all entrances to the fifth ring road. Shit. He might actually get away .” Da Shi looked around and saw the bullet holes in the wall. He glanced at the shell casings scattered on the ground and added, “The man got of f five shots, and three hit her . She shot twiceboth misses.” Then h e crouched down to examine the body with the other of ficer . Xu stood farther away , stealing a glance at W ei Cheng next to her . Da Shi also looked up at him. On W ei’ s face w as a trace of shock and a trace of sorrow , but only a trace. His usual wooden expres sion didn’ t break. He was far calmer than W ang. “Y ou don’ t seem bothered by this,” Da Shi said to W ei. “They probably came to kill you.” W ei gave a ghastly grin. “What can I do? Even now , I still don’ t know anything about her . I’ve told her many times to keep life simple. I’m thinking of the abbot’ s counsel to me that night. But … eh.” Da Shi stood up and walked over to stand in front of W ei. He took out a cigarette and lit it. “I think you still have some things you haven’ t told us.” “Some things I was too lazy to talk about.” “Then you’d better work harder now!” W ei thou ght for a moment and s aid, “T odayno, yesterday afte rnoon she ar gu ed with a man in the living room. It’ s that Pan Han, the famous environmentalist. They had ar gued a few times before, in Japanese, as though a fraid to have me listen in. But yesterday they didn’ t ca re at all and ar gued in Chinese. I overheard a few snatches.” “T ry to tell us exactly what you heard.”“Fine. Pan Han said, ‘Although we seem like fellow travelers on the surface, in reality we’re irreco ncilable enemies.’ Shen said, ‘Y es, you’re trying to use our Lord’ s power against the human race.’ Pan said, ‘Y our understanding is not completely unreasonable. W e want our Lord to come to this world, to punish those who have long deserved it. However , you’re working to prevent our Lord’ s coming, and that’ s why we can’ t tolerate you. If you don’ t sto p, we’ll make you stop!’ Shen said, ‘The com mander was blind to allow yo u to join the or ganization!’ Pan said, ‘Speaking of, can you tell whether the commande r sides with the Adventists or the Redemptionists? Does the commander want humanity eliminated or saved?’ Pan’ s words briefly silenced Shen, and the two didn’ t ar gue so loudly anymore. I couldn’ t hear anything else.” “What did the man who threatened you on the phone sound like?” “Y ou’re asking if he sounded like Pan Han? I don’ t know . He was speaking very softly , and I couldn’ t tell.” Several more police cars arrived, sirens blaring. A group of white- gloved policeme n came upstairs with cameras, and the house hu mmed with activity . Da Shi told W ang to go back and get some rest. Instead, W ang walked into the r oom with the minicomputer to f ind W ei. “Can you give me an outline of your three-body evolutionary a lgorithm? I want to … introduce it to some people. I know my request is ab rupt. If you can’ t, don’ t worry about it.” W ei took out a CD and handed it to W ang. “It’ s all on here: the whole model and additional document ation. Do me a favor and publish it under your own name. That would be a big help.” “No, no! How could I do that?” W ei poi nted at the disk in W an g’ s hand and said, “Professor W ang, I noticed you the first time you came here. Y ou’re a good man, a man with a sense of responsibility . That’ s w hy I’m counseling you to stay away from this. The world is about to chan ge. Everyone should try to live out the rest of their lives in peace. That would be best. Don’ t worry too much about other matters. It’ s all useless anyway .” “Y ou seem to know even more than you let on.” “I spent every day with her . It’ s impossible to have no inkling.” “Then why not tell the police?”W ei sm iled contemptuously . “The police are worthless. Even if God were her e, it wouldn’ t do any good. The entire human race has reached the point where no one is listening to their prayers.” W ei was standing next to an east-facing window . Through th e glass, beyond the distant cityscape, the sky was brightening with the first light of dawn. F or some reason, the lig ht reminded W ang of the stran ge dawn he saw each time he logged on to Thr ee Body . “In r eality , I’m not so detached. I haven’ t been able to sleep the last few nights. Every morning when I see the sunrise, it feels like sunset.” He turned to W ang, and after a long pause, added, “And it’ s all because God, or the Lord she talked about, can’ t even protect Himself anymore.”"

世界文明没有未来，你们那点荣誉算个屁！ ” 两名剑客谁都不理他，专心于他们的战斗。个子高的那位突然痛叫 一声，剑“当啷”一声掉到地上，捂着胳膊跑了。另一位追了几步，冲着 失利者的背影啐了一口。 “呸，无耻之徒！ ”他弯腰拾起了自己的假发，抬头看到了汪淼，就 用剑指着逃跑者的方向说， “他居然说微积分是他发明的！ ”说着他戴 上假发，一只手捂着胸口对汪淼行了个欧式的鞠躬礼， “伊萨克牛 顿。” “那么跑了的那一位是莱布尼茨了？”汪淼问。 “是他，无耻之徒！呸！ ！其实我根本不屑于同他争夺这项名誉，力 地球往事 三体 153 学三定律的发现，就已经使我成为仅次于上帝的人，从星球运行到细胞 分裂，无不遵从于这三个伟大的定律。现在有了微积分这个强有力的数 学工具，以三定律为基础，掌握三个太阳运行的规律指日可待。 ” “没有那么简单。 ”劝架的人说， “你考虑过计算量吗？我看过你列

“可您说过，全世界的数学家都不够用。 ” “我们不会用数学家的，我们用普通人，普通劳动力，但需要的数 量巨大，最少要三千万人！这是数学的人海战术。 ” “普通人？三千万？ ！”汪淼惊奇万分， “我要是没理解错，这是一个 百分之九十的人都是文盲的时代，您要找三千万个懂微积分的？” “有一个川军的笑话你听说过吗？”冯诺伊曼掏出一枝粗雪茄，咬 开头点了起来， “士兵们练队列，因为文化水平极低，连军官喊一二一 都听不懂，于是军官想了一个办法，让每个士兵左脚穿草鞋右脚穿布 鞋，走队列时喊：草孩布孩、草孩布孩……（四川话）我们需要这样水平 ①现代计算机技术的奠基者。 ②控制论创始人。 中国科幻基石丛书 154 的士兵就行，但要三千万。 ” 听到这个近现代的笑话，汪淼知道面前这位不是程序而是人，而且 几乎可以肯定是中国人。 “这样庞大的军队，难以想象。 ”汪淼摇摇头说。 “所以我们来找秦始皇。 ”牛顿指指金字塔说。 “现在这里还是他在统治吗？”汪淼四下打量了一下问，看到守卫 金字塔入口的士兵确实穿着秦代简洁的软甲兵服，拿着长戟。对《三 体》中历史的错乱，汪淼已经见多不怪了。 “整个世界都要由他统治了，他拥有一支三千多万人的大军，准备 去征服欧洲。好了，让我们去见他吧。 ”冯诺伊曼一手指着金字塔入口 说，然后又指着牛顿说， “把剑扔了！ ” 牛顿“当啷”一声扔下剑，三人走进入口，走到门廊尽头就要进入 大殿时，一名卫士坚持让他们都脱光衣服，牛顿抗议说我们是著名学 者，没有暗器！双方僵持之时，大殿内传来一声低沉的男音： “是发现三 定律的西洋人吗？让他们进来。 ”走进大殿，三人看到秦嬴政正在殿中 踱着步，长衣的后摆和那柄著名的长剑都拖在地上。他转身看着三位学 者，汪淼立刻发现，那是纣王和格里高利教皇的眼睛。 “你们的来意我知道了，你们是西洋人，干吗不去找凯撒？他的帝 国疆域广大，应该能凑齐三千万大军吧。 ” “可是尊敬的皇帝，您知道那是一支什么样的军队吗？您知道那个 帝国现在是什么样子吗？在宏伟的罗马城内，穿过城市的河流都被严重 污染，你知道是什么所致吗？” “军工企业？” “不不，伟大的皇帝，是罗马人暴饮暴食后的呕吐物！那些贵族赴 宴时餐桌下放着担架，吃得走不动时就让仆人抬回去。整个帝国陷入荒 淫无度的泥潭中不可自拔，就是组成了三千万大军，也不可能具备进行 这种伟大计算的素质和体力。 ” “这朕知道， ”秦始皇说， “但凯撒正在清醒过来，在重整军备，西 地球往事 三体 155 洋人的智慧也是件可怕的东西，你们并不比东方人聪明，但想对了路 子，比如他能看出太阳有三个，你能想出那三条定律，都是很了不起的， 东方人暂时做不到。而我现在还没有能力远征西洋，我的船不行，从陆 上走，漫长的供应线无法维持。 ” “所以，伟大的皇帝，您的帝国还要发展！ ”冯诺伊曼不失时机 地说，“如果掌握了太阳运行的规律，你就能充分利用每一个恒纪元，同 时避免乱纪元带来的损失，这样发展速度比西洋要快得多。请你相信我 们，我们是学者，只要能用三定律和微积分准确预测太阳的运行，不在 乎谁征服统治世界。 ” “朕当然需要预测太阳的运行，但你们让我集结三千万大军，至少 要首先向朕演示一下这种计算如何进行吧。 ” “陛下，请给我三个士兵，我将为您演示。 ”冯诺伊曼兴奋起来。 “三个？只要三个吗？朕可以轻易给你三千个。 ”秦始皇用不信任 的目光扫视看着冯诺伊曼。 “伟大的陛下，您刚才提到东方人在科学思维上的缺陷，就是因为 你们没有意识到，复杂的宇宙万物其实是由最简单的单元构成的。我只 要三个，陛下。 ” 秦始皇挥手召来了三名士兵，他们都很年轻，与秦国的其他士兵一 样，一举一动像听从命令的机器。 “我不知道你们的名字， ”冯诺伊曼拍拍前两个士兵的肩， “你 们两个负责信号输入，就叫‘入 1’ 、‘入 2’吧，”他又指指最后一名士兵， “你，负责信号输出，就叫‘出’吧。 ”他伸手拨动三名士兵， “这样，站 成一个三角形，出是顶端，入 1和入 2是底边。 ” “哼，你让他们成楔形攻击队形不就行了？”秦始皇轻蔑地看着冯 诺伊曼。 牛顿不知从什么地方掏出六面小旗，三白三黑，冯诺伊曼接过来 分给三名士兵，每人一白一黑，说： “白色代表 0，黑色代表 1。好，现在 听我说，出，你转身看着入 1和入 2，如果他们都举黑旗，你就举黑旗，其 中国科幻基石丛书 156 他的情况你都举白旗，这种情况有三种：入 l白，入 2黑；入 l黑，入 2 白；入 1、入 2都是白。 ” “我觉得你应该换种颜色，白旗代表投降。 ”秦始皇说。 兴奋中的冯诺伊曼没有理睬皇帝，对三名士兵大声命令： “现在 开始运行！入 1入2，你们每人随意举旗，好，举！好，再举！举！ ” 入1和入 2同时举了三次旗，第一次是黑黑，第二次是白黑，第三 次是黑白。出都进行了正确反应，分别举起了一次黑和两次白。 “很好，运行正确，陛下，您的士兵很聪明！ ” “这事儿傻瓜都会，你能告诉朕，他们在干什么吗？”秦始皇一脸困 惑地问。 “这三个人组成了一个计算系统的部件，是门部件的一种，叫‘与 门’ 。 ”冯诺伊曼说完停了一会儿，好让皇帝理解。 秦始皇面无表情地说： “朕是够郁闷的，好，继续。 ” 冯诺伊曼转向排成三角阵的三名士兵： “我们构建下一个部件。 你，出，只要看到入 1和入 2中有一个人举黑旗，你就举黑旗，这种情况 有三种组合 黑黑、白黑、黑白，剩下的一种情况 白白，你就举白 旗。明白了吗？好孩子，你真聪明，门部件的正确运行你是关键，好好干， 皇帝会奖赏你的！下面开始运行：举！好，再举！再举！好极了，运行正 常，陛下，这个门部件叫或门。 ” 然后，冯诺伊曼又用三名士兵构建了与非门、或非门、异或门、同 或门和三态门，最后只用两名士兵构建了最简单的非门，出总是举与入 颜色相反的旗。 冯诺伊曼对皇帝鞠躬说： “现在，陛下，所有的门部件都已演示完 毕，这很简单不是吗？任何三名士兵经过一小时的训练就可以掌握。 ” “他们不需要学更多的东西了吗？”秦始皇问。 “不需要，我们组建一千万个这样的门部件，再将这些部件组合成 一个系统，这个系统就能进行我们所需要的运算，解出那些预测太阳运 行的微分方程。这个系统，我们把它叫做……嗯，叫做……” 地球往事 三体 157 “计算机。 ”汪淼说。 “啊 好！ ”冯诺伊曼对汪淼竖起一根指头， “计算机，这个名 字好，整个系统实际上就是一部庞大的机器，是有史以来最复杂的机 器！” 游戏时间加快，三个月过去了。 秦始皇、牛顿、冯诺伊曼和汪淼站在金字塔顶部的平台上，这个平 台与汪淼和墨子相遇时的很相似，架设着大量的天文观测仪器，其中有 一部分是欧洲近代的设备。在他们下方，三千万秦国军队宏伟的方阵铺 展在大地上，这是一个边长六公里的正方形。在初升的太阳下，方阵凝 固了似的纹丝不动，仿佛一张由三千万个兵马俑构成的巨毯，但飞翔的 鸟群误入这巨毯上空时，立刻感到了下方浓重的杀气，鸟群顿时大乱， 惊慌混乱地散开或绕行。汪淼在心里算了算，如果全人类站成这样一个 方阵，面积也不过是上海浦东大小，比起它表现的力量，这方阵更显示 了文明的脆弱。 “陛下，您的军队真是举世无双，这么短的时间，就完成了如此复 杂的训练。 ”冯诺伊曼对秦始皇赞叹道。 “虽然整体上复杂，但每个士兵要做的很简单，比起以前为粉碎马 其顿方阵进行的训练来，这算不了什么。 ”秦始皇按着长剑剑柄说。 “上帝也保佑，连着两个这样长的恒纪元。 ”牛顿说。 “即使是乱纪元，朕的军队也照样训练，以后，他们也会在乱纪元 完成你们的计算。 ”秦始皇骄傲地扫视着方阵说。 “那么，请陛下发出您伟大的号令吧！ ”冯诺伊曼用激动得发颤的 声音说。 秦始皇点点头，一名卫士奔跑过来，握住皇帝的剑柄向后退了几 步，抽出了那柄皇帝本人无法抽出的青铜长剑，然后上前跪下将剑呈给 皇帝，秦始皇对着长空扬起长剑，高声喊道： “成计算机队列！ ” 金字塔四角的四尊青铜大鼎同时轰地燃烧起来，站满了金字塔面 中国科幻基石丛书 地球往事 三体 中国科幻基石丛书 160 向方阵一面坡墙的士兵用宏大的合唱将始皇帝的号令传诵下去： “成计算机队列 ” 下面的大地上，方阵均匀的色彩开始出现扰动，复杂精细的回路结 构浮现出来，并渐渐充满了整个方阵，十分钟后，大地上出现了一块三 十六平方公里的计算机主板。 冯诺伊曼指着下方巨大的人列回路开始介绍： “陛下，我们把这 台计算机命名为‘秦一号’ 。请看，那里，中心部分，是 CPU，是计算机 的核心计算元件，由您最精锐的五个军团构成，对照这张图您可以看到 里面的加法器、寄存器、堆栈存贮器；外围整齐的部分是内存，构建这部 分时我们发现人手不够，好在这部分每个单元的动作最简单，就训练每 个士兵拿多种颜色的旗帜，组合起来后，一个人就能同时完成最初二十 个人的操作，这就使内存容量达到了运行‘秦 1.0’操作系统的最低要 求；你再看那条贯穿整个阵列的通道，还有那些在通道上待命的轻骑 兵，那是 BUS，系统总线，负责在整个系统间传递信息。 ” “总线结构是个伟大的发明，新的插件，最大可由十个军团构成， 能够快捷地挂接到总线上运行，这使得‘秦一号’的硬件扩展和升级十 分便利；再看最远处那一边，可能要用望远镜才能看清，那是外存，我们 又用了哥白尼起的名字，叫它‘硬盘’ ，那是由三百万名文化程度较高 的人构成，您上次坑儒时把他们留下是对了，他们每个人手中都有一个 记录本和一支笔，负责记录运算结果，当然，他们最大的工作量还是作 为虚拟内存，存贮中间运算结果，运算速度的瓶颈就在他们那里。这儿， 离我们最近的地方，是显示阵列，能显示计算机运行的主要状态参 数。” 冯诺伊曼和牛顿搬来一个一人多高的大纸卷，在秦始皇面前展开 来，当纸卷展到尽头时，汪淼一阵头皮发紧，但他想象中的匕首并没有 出现，面前只有一张写满符号的大纸，那些符号都是蝇头大小，密密麻 麻，看上去与下面的计算机阵列一样令人头晕目眩。 “陛下，这就是我们开发的‘秦 1.0’版操作系统，计算软件将在它 地球往事 三体 161 上面运行。陛下您看 ”冯诺伊曼指指下面的人列计算机， “这阵列 是硬件，而这张纸上写的是软件，硬件和软件，就如同琴和乐谱的关 系。 ”说着他和牛顿又展开了一张同样大小的纸， “陛下，这就是数值 法解那一组微分方程的软件，将天文观测得到的三个太阳在某一时间 断面的运动矢量输入，它的运行就能为我们预测以后任一时刻太阳的 运行状态。我们这次计算，将对以后两年太阳的运行做出完整预测，每 组预测值的时间间隔为一百二十小时。 ” 秦始皇点点头： “那就开始吧。 ” 冯诺伊曼双手过顶，庄严地喊道： “奉圣上御旨，计算机启动！系 统自检！ ” 在金字塔的中部，一排旗手用旗语发出指令，一时间，下面大地上 三千万人构成的巨型主板仿佛液化了，充满了细密的粼粼波光，那是几 千万面小旗在挥动。在靠近金字塔底部的显示阵列中，一条由无数面绿 色大旗构成的进度条在延伸着，标示着自检的进度。十分钟后，进度条 走到了头。 “自检完成！引导程序运行！操作系统加载！ ！ ” 下面，贯穿人列计算机的系统总线上的轻骑兵快速运动起来，总线 立刻变成了一条湍急的河流，这河流沿途又分成无数条细小的支流，渗 入到各个模块阵列之中。很快，黑白旗的涟漪演化成汹涌的浪潮，激荡 在整块主板上。中央的 CPU区激荡最为剧烈，像一片燃烧的火药。突 然，仿佛火药燃尽， CPU区的扰动渐渐平静下来，最后竟完全静止了， 以它为圆心，这静止向各个方向飞快扩散开来，像快速封冻的海面，最 后整块主板大部分静止了，其间只有一些零星的死循环在以不变的节 奏没有生气地闪动着，显示阵列中出现了闪动的红色。 “系统锁死！ ”一名信号官高喊。故障原因很快查清，是 CPU状态 寄存器中的一个门电路运行出错。 “系统重新热启动！ ”冯诺伊曼胸有成竹地命令道。 “慢！ ”牛顿挥手制止了信号官，转身一脸阴毒地对秦始皇说， “陛 中国科幻基石丛书 162 下，为了系统的稳定运行，对故障率较高的部件应该采取一些维修措 施。” 秦始皇拄着长剑说： “更换出错部件，组成那个部件的所有兵卒， 斩！以后故障照此办理。 ” 冯诺伊曼厌恶地看了牛顿一眼，看着一组利剑出鞘的骑兵冲进主 板， “维修”了故障部件后，重新发布了热启动命令。这次启动十分顺 利，二十分钟后，三体世界的冯诺伊曼结构人列计算机在“秦 1.0”操 作系统下进入运行状态。 “启动太阳轨道计算软件‘ Three -Body l.0’ ！”牛顿声嘶力竭地发 令， “启动计算主控！加载差分模块！加载有限元模块！加载谱方法模 块……调入初始条件参数！计算启动！ ！ ” 主板上波光粼粼，显示阵列上的各色标志此起彼伏地闪动，人列计 算机开始了漫长的计算。 “真是很有意思。 ”秦始皇手指壮观的计算机说， “每个人如此简 单的行为，竟产生了如此复杂的大东西！欧洲人骂朕独裁暴政，扼杀了 社会的创造力，其实在严格纪律约束下的大量的人，合为一个整体后也 能产生伟大的智慧。 ” “伟大的始皇帝，这是机器的机械运行，不是智慧。这些普通卑贱 的人都是一个个零，只有在最前面加上您这样一个一，他们的整体才有 意义。”牛顿带着奉承的微笑说。 “恶心的哲学。 ”冯诺伊曼瞥了牛顿一眼说， “如果到时候，按你 的理论和数学模型计算出的结果与预测不符，你我可就连零都不是 了。” “对，那时你们可真的什么都不是了！ ”秦始皇说着，拂袖而去。 时光飞逝，人列计算机运行了一年零四个月，除去程序的调试时 间，实际计算时间约一年两个月，这期间，只因乱纪元过分恶劣的气候 中断过两次，但计算机存贮了中断现场数据，都成功地从断点恢复了运 地球往事 三体 163 行。当秦始皇和欧洲学者们再次登上金字塔顶部时，第一阶段的计算已 经完成，这批结果数据，精确地描述了以后两年太阳运行的轨道状况。 这是一个寒冷的黎明，彻夜照耀着巨大主板的无数火炬已经熄灭， 计算机完成后， “秦 1.0”进入待机状态，主板表面汹涌的浪涛变成了平 静的微波。 冯诺伊曼和牛顿将记录着运行结果的长卷呈献给秦始皇，牛顿 说： “伟大的始皇帝，本来计算在三天前就已完成，之所以今天才将结 果献给您，是因为按照计算结果，这一段漫长的寒夜就要结束，我们将 迎来一个长恒纪元的第一次日出，这个恒纪元将持续一年之久，从太阳 轨道参数看，气候宜人，请让您的王国从脱水中复活吧。 ” “朕的国家自计算开始后从来就没有脱水过！ ”秦始皇一把抓过纸 卷，没好气地说， “朕倾大秦之国力来维持计算机的运行，已经耗尽了 所有储备，到现在，为此饿死累死和冻死热死的人不计其数。 ”秦始皇 用纸卷指指远方，晨光中，可以看到从主板各个边缘，有几十条白线在 大地上辐射向各个方向，消失在遥远的天边，那是全国各地向主板运送 供给品的道路。 “陛下，您将发现这是值得的，在掌握了太阳的运行规律后，秦国 将飞速发展，很快会比计算开始之前强大许多倍。 ”冯诺伊曼说。 “按照计算，太阳就要升起来了，陛下，享受您的荣耀吧！ ” 仿佛是回应牛顿的话，一轮红日升出地平线，将金字塔和人列计算 机笼罩在一片金光中。主板上爆发出一阵海潮般的欢呼声。 这时，一个人急匆匆地跑来，可能跑得太急了，下跪时气喘吁吁地 趴到了地上，这是秦国的天文大臣。 “圣上，不好了，计算有误！大难将临！ ！ ”他哭喊道。 “你胡说些什么？！ ”没等秦始皇答话，牛顿就踹了天文大臣一脚， “没看到太阳精确地按照计算结果的时间升起了吗？” “可……”大臣半直起身，一手指着太阳， “那是几颗太阳？ ！ ” 所有的人看着正在上升的太阳，都莫名其妙。 “大臣，你是受过正 中国科幻基石丛书 164 统西洋教育的剑桥留学博士，不会愚蠢到不识数吧，太阳当然是一颗， 而且气温适宜。 ”冯诺伊曼说。 “不，是三颗！ ！ ”大臣抽泣着说， “另外两颗，在这一颗的后面！ ” 人们再次看着太阳，对大臣的话都感到很茫然。 “帝国天文台的观测表明，现在出现了亘古罕有的‘三日连珠’ ， 三颗太阳成一条直线，以相同的角速度围绕我们的行星运行！这样， 我们的行星和三颗太阳，四者始终处于一条直线上！我们的世界始终在 这条线的顶端！ ” “你肯定观察无误？ ”牛顿抓住大臣的衣领问。 “当然无误！观测是由帝国天文台的西洋天文学家进行的，其中有 开普勒和赫歇尔，他们使用从欧洲进口的世界上最大的望远镜！ ” 牛顿松开天文大臣直起身来，汪淼发现他脸色发白，但表情却欣喜 若狂，他两手抱在胸前对秦始皇说： “最伟大的、最尊敬的皇帝，这可是 吉兆中的吉兆啊！现在，三颗太阳围绕着我们的行星旋转，您的帝国成 了宇宙中心！这是上帝对我们努力的奖赏！待我去再详细查阅一下计算 结果，我会证实这一点的！ ”说完，趁所有人都还在茫然中，他顾自溜 走；稍后，有人报告说牛顿爵士偷了一匹快马去向不明。 一阵紧张的沉默后，汪淼突然说： “陛下，请把您的剑抽出来。 ” “干什么？”秦始皇不解地问，但还是对旁边他的抽剑兵做了个手 式，那士兵立刻为皇帝抽出长剑。 汪淼说： “您挥一挥。 ” 秦始皇接过剑，挥了几下，面露惊奇之色： “咦，怎么这么轻？ ！ ” “游戏的 V装具不能模拟失重感觉，否则我们也会感觉到自己轻 了许多。 ” “看下面！看那马，那人！ ”有人惊叫，大家一齐向下看去，看到金字 塔脚下一队行进中的骑兵，所有的战马似乎是在地面上飘行，飘很远四 蹄才着地一次；他们又看到几个奔跑中的人，他们迈一步就能跃出十几 米，但每一跃的下落很缓慢。金字塔上，一名卫士试着跳了一下，轻易地 地球往事 三体 165 跳上了三米多的高度。 “怎么回事？ ！”秦始皇惊恐地看着那个刚刚跳上半空的人缓缓下 落。 “圣上，三颗太阳成一线直对我们的行星，它们的引力以相同的方 向叠加到这里……”天文大臣解释说，同时发现自己双脚离地已经横 在半空，其他人也相继以不同角度倾斜着，双脚都离开了地面开始飘 浮，他们像一群不会游泳的落水者那样笨拙地挥动着四肢试图稳定自 己，但还是不时相撞。这时，他们刚刚飘离的地面像蛛网似的开裂了，裂 缝迅速扩大，在弥漫的灰浆和天崩地裂般的巨响中，下面的金字塔裂解 为组成它的无数块巨石。透过缓缓飘浮的巨石间的缝隙，汪淼看到了正 在变形中的大殿，那尊煮过伏羲的大鼎和他曾被缚于其上的火刑柱在 大殿正中飘浮着。 太阳升到了正空，飘浮着的一切：人、巨石、天文仪器、青铜大鼎，都 开始缓缓上升，并在很快加速。汪淼无意中扫了一眼平原上的人列计算 机，看到了一幅噩梦般的画面：组成主板的三千万人正在飘离地面，飞 快上升，像一大片被吸尘器吸起的蚂蚁群。在他们飞离的大地上，竟清 晰地留下了主板电路的印痕，那一大片只有从高空才能一览全貌的精 细复杂的图纹，将在遥远的未来成为令下一个三体文明困惑的遗迹。汪 淼抬头望去，天空被一片斑驳怪异的云层所覆盖，这云是由尘埃、石块、 人体和其他杂物构成，太阳在云层后面闪耀着。在远方，汪淼看到了连 绵的透明山脉在缓缓上升，那山脉晶莹剔透，在闪闪发光中变幻着形 状，那是被吸向太空的海洋！ 三体世界表面的一切都被吸向太阳。 汪淼环顾四周，看到了冯诺伊曼和秦始皇，冯诺伊曼在飘浮中对 秦始皇大声说着什么，但没有声音发出，只出现了一行小小的字幕： “……我想到了，用电元件！用电元件做成门电路，组成计算机！那样计 算机的速度要快许多倍！体积也要小许多，估计用一幢小楼就放下了 ……陛下，您在听我说吗？ ” 中国科幻基石丛书 166 秦始皇挥着长剑砍向冯诺伊曼，后者蹬着旁边飘浮的一块巨石躲 开了，长剑砍在巨石上，迸出一片火花断成两截。紧接着，这块巨石与另 一块相撞，将秦始皇夹在中间，碎石和血肉横飞，惨不忍睹，但汪淼没有 听到相撞的巨响，周围已经一片死寂，由于空气散失，声音也不存在了。 飘浮在空中的人体在真空中血液沸腾，吐出内脏，变成了一团团由体液 化成的冰晶云围绕着的形状怪异的东西。由于大气层消失，天空已经变 得漆黑，从三体世界被吸入太空的一切反射着太阳光，在太空中构成了 一片灿烂的星云，这星云形成巨大的旋涡，流向最终的归宿 太阳。 汪淼这时发现太阳的形状在变化，他马上明白，自己实际上是看到 了另外两颗太阳，它们都从第一颗太阳后面露出一小部分，从这个方向 看，三只叠加的太阳构成了宇宙中一只明亮的眼睛。以三颗太阳的队列 为背景，字幕出现： 第184号文明在“三日连珠”的引力叠加中毁灭了，该文明进化 至科学革命和工业革命。 这次文明中，牛顿建立了低速状态下的经典力学体系，同时，由于 微积分和冯诺伊曼结构计算机的发明，奠定了对三体运动进行定量数 学分析的基础。 漫长的时间后，生命和文明将重新启动，再次开始在三体世界中命 运莫测的进化。 欢迎再次登录。 汪淼刚刚退出游戏，便来了一个陌生的电话，是一个声音很有磁性 的男音： “您好，首先感谢您留下了真实的电话，我是《三体》游戏的系 统管理员。 ” 汪淼一阵激动和紧张。

dif ferent than the first: still the strange, cold dawn, still that colossal pyramid. But this time, the pyramid was back in the Egyptian style. W ang heard the crisp sound of metal striking against metal. The clashing only highlighted the si lence of the chilly dawn. Searc hing for the source, he saw two dark shadow s flickering at the foot of the pyramid. In the dim light, metallic glints flashed between the shadows: a swordfight. Once his eyes h ad adjusted, W ang saw the figures more clearly . Based on t he shape of the pyramid, this should be someplace in Thr ee Body ’ s version of the East, but the tw o fighters were Europeans dressed in a sixteenth- or seventeenth-century style. The shorter one duck ed below a swinging sword and his silvery wig fell to the ground. After a few more thrusts and parries, another man appeared around the corner of the pyramid and ran toward t he fighters. He t ried to get the two to stop, but the swinging blades whistling through the air prevented him from getting close. He s houted, “Stop! Don’ t you tw o have anything better to do? Where’ s your sense of responsibility? If civilization has no future, what good is this supposed bit of glory you’re fighting over?” Both swordfight ers ignored him, concentrating on the duel. The taller one suddenly cried out in pain , and his sword fell to the gro und with aclang. H e turned and ran, holdi ng his wounded arm. The other gave chase for a few steps and spat in the direction of the loser . “Shameless!” He bent down to pick up his wig. As he straightened up, he saw W ang. P ointing in the di rection of the escapee, he said, “He dared to claim that he in vented calculus !” He put on his wig, put a hand over his heart, and bowed courteously to W ang. “Isaac Newton, at your service.” “Then the one who ran away must be Leibniz?” W ang asked. “Indeed, an unscrupulous man. I don’ t really care about this little claim to fame. Inventing the three laws of mechanics has already made me the greatest, God excepted. From planetary motion to cell division, everything follows the three great laws. No w , with the powerful mathematical tool that is calcul us, it will only be a ma tter of time before we master the pattern of the motion of the three suns.” “It’ s not that simple,” said the man who had tried to stop the fight. “Have you considered the amount of calculation that’ s needed? I saw the dif ferential equa tions you listed, and I don’ t think an analytical solution is possible, only a numerical one. However , the calculating capacity required is su ch t hat even if all of the wo rld’ s mathematicians worked wi thout pause, they’d still not be able to complete them by the time the world ended. Of course, if we can’ t figure out the pattern of the suns’ movemen ts soon, the end of the world will not be too far away .” He bowed at W ang as well, a more modern bow . “V on Neumann.” “Didn’ t you bring us thousands of miles to the East specifically to solve the p roblem of c alculating these equations?” Newton asked. The n he turned to W ang. “Norbert W iener and that degenerate who just ran away also came with us. W e encountered some p irates near Madagascar . W iener fought the pirates by himself so that the rest of us could escape, and he died valiantly .” “Why did you h ave to come to the East to build a computer? ” W ang asked V on Neumann. V on Neumann and Newton look ed at each other , puzzled. “A computer? A computing machine ! Such a thing exists?” “Y ou do n’ t know about computers? Then what did you have in m ind for completing the vast amount of calculations?” V on Ne umann stared at W ang with wide-open eyes, as though his question made no sense. “Using people, of course. Other than people, what else in the world is capable of performing calculations?”“But you just said that all the mathematicians in the world wouldn’ t be enough.” “Instead of mathematicians, we ’ll use common laborers. But we need many of them, at least thirty million. W e’ll do mathematics u sing human wave tactics.” “Common laborers? Thirty million?” W ang was amazed. “But if I recall correctly , this is an age when ninety percent of the population are illiterate. Y et you want to find thirty million people who understand calculus?” “Have y ou hear d the joke abou t the Army of Sichuan?” V on Neumann took out a thick cigar , bit of f the end, and lit it. “Some soldiers were being drilled, but because they had n o education, they couldn’ t even follow the drill instructor ’ s simple orders to march LEFT -RIGHT -LEFT . So the instructor came up with a solution: He had every soldier wear a straw shoe on the left foot and a cloth shoe on the right. When they m arched, he shouted”here he switched t o a Sichuan accent“STRA W -CLOTH- STRA W -CLOTH.… That’ s the kind of soldier we need. Except we need thirty million of them.” Hearing this modern joke, W ang knew that the man before him wasn’ t a program but a real person, and almost certainly Chinese. “It’ s hard to imagine such a lar ge army ,” W ang said, shaking his head. “That’ s why we’ve come to see Qin Shi Huang, the First Em peror .” Newton pointed at the pyramid. “He’ s st ill in char ge?” W ang looked around. He saw that the soldiers guarding the entrance to the pyramid really were equipped with the simple leather a rmor an d ji -style halberds of the Qin Dynasty . The anachronistic mix of historical elements in Thr ee Body no longer surprised him. “The whole world is going to be under his rule because he has an army of m ore than thi rty million preparing to conquer Europe. All right, let’ s go see him.” V on Neumann turned to Newton. “Drop the sword.” Newton obeyed. The three of them entered the pyramid, and just as they were about to emer ge from the tunnel into the Great Hall, a guard insisted that they strip of f all their clot hes. Newton objected. “W e’re famous scholars. No one of our stature would carry hidden weapons!” As t he tw o sides explored this s talemate, a deep, male voice cam e from the Great Hall. “Is it the foreigner who discovered the three laws of motion?Let him and his companions in.” They en tered the Great Hall. T he First Emperor was pacing back and forth, his robe and his famous long sword both dragging along the ground. As he turned to gaze at the three scholars, W ang realized that hi s eyes were the same as the eyes of King Zhou of Shang and Pope Gregory . “I alread y know the purpose of your visit. Y ou’re Europeans. Why not go f ind Caesar? His empire is vast. Surely he can find you thirty million men.” “But my most honored Empero r , do you know what kind of army he has? Do you kn ow what shape his empire is in? In the magnificent eternal city of Rome, e ven the river that flows through the city has been heavily polluted. Do you know the cause?” “Military industrial production?” “No, Gr eat Emperor , it’ s the vomit from Romans after their binge and pur ge feasts. When the nobles attend the feasts, stretchers have already been prepared for them under the tables. When they’ve eaten so much that they can no longer move, the servants carry them home. The entire empire has sunk into a quagmire of extravagance from which they cannot extricate themselves. Eve n if Caesar could or ganize an army of thirty million, it would not have the quality an d strength necessary to perform this great calculation.” “I am aware of t hat,” Qin Shi Huang said. “But Caesar is waking up and reinvigorating h is army . The wisdom of W esterners is terrifying. Y ou are not more intelligent than the me n of the East, but you can see the right path. For exam ple, Co pernicus could figure out that there are three suns, and you could come up with your three laws. These are very impressive accomplishments. W e here in the East cannot, for now , match them. I don’ t possess the ability to conquer Europe. My ships are not good e nough, and the supply lines cannot be maintained for long enough to go over land.” “That’ s why your empire must continue to develop, Great Emperor!” V on Neumann seized the opportunity . “If you can master the pattern of the suns’ movements, you will be able to make the most of each Stable Era, and also avoid the damage brought by each Chaotic Era. This way , your progress will be much faster tha n Europe’ s. Believe us, we’re s cholars. As long as we can use the three l aws of motion and calculus to accuratelyforecast the movements of the suns, we do not care who c onquers the world.” “Of course I need to predict the suns’ movements. But if you want me to gather th irty mi llion men, you m ust at least demonstrate for m e how such calculations would be conducted.” “Y our Imperial Majesty , please give me three soldiers. I will demonstrate.” V on Neumann grew excited. “Three? Only three? I can easily give you three thousand.” Qin Shi Huang glanced at V on Neumann, distrustful. “Y our Imperial Majesty , you mentioned just now the defec t in the Eastern mind when it comes to scientific thinking. This is because you have not real ized that even the complicated objects of the univers e are made from the simplest elements. I only need three.” Qin Shi Huang waved his hand and three soldiers came forward. They were all very y oung. Like other Qin soldiers, they moved like order - obeying machines. “I don’ t know your names,” V on Neumann said, tapping the shoulders of two of the soldiers. “The two of you will be responsible for signal input, so I’ ll ca ll you ‘Input 1’ and ‘In put 2.’” He pointed to the last s oldier . “Y ou will be responsible for signal output, so I’ll call you ‘Output.’” He shoved the soldiers to where he wanted them to stand. “Form a triangle. Like this. Output is the apex. Input 1 and Input 2 form the base.” “Y ou could have just told t hem to stand in the W edge Attack Formation,” Qin Shi Huang said, glancing at V on Neumann contemptuously . Newton took out six small flags: three white, three black. V on N eumann handed them out to the three soldiers so that each held a black flag and a white flag. “White represents 0 ; black represents 1. Good. No w , listen to me. Out put, you turn around an d look at Input 1 and Input 2. If they both raise bl ack fla gs, you raise a black flag as well. Under all other circumstances, you raise the white flag.” “I think you should use some other color ,” Qin Shi Huang said. “White means surrender .” The excited V on Neumann ignored him. He shouted orders at the three soldiers. “Begin operation! Input 1 and Input 2, you can raise whichever flag you want. Good. Raise! Good. Raise again! Raise!”Input 1 and Input 2 raised thei r flags three times. The first time they were bla ck-black, the second time white-black, and the third time black- white. Output reacted correctly each time, raising the black fla g once and the white one twice. “V ery good. Y our Imperial Majesty , your soldiers are very smart.” “Even an idiot would be capable of that. T ell me, what are they really doing?” Qin Shi Huang looked baf fled. “The three soldiers form a computing component. It’ s a type of gate, an AND gate.” V on Neumann paused to let the emperor digest this information. Qin Shi Huang said impassively , “I’m not impressed. Continue.” V on Neu mann turned to the th ree soldiers again. “Let’ s form another component. Y ou , Output: if you see either Input 1 or Input 2 raise a black flag, you raise the black flag. There are three situations where that will be true: black-black, white-black, black-white. When it’ s white -white, you raise the white f lag. Understand ? Good lad, you’re really clever . Y ou’re the key to the correct functioning of the gate. W ork hard, and the emperor will reward you! Let’ s begin operation. Raise! Good, raise again! Raise again! Perfect. Y our Imperial Majesty , this component is called an OR gate.” Then, V on Neum ann used the t hree soldiers to form a NAND gate, a NOR gate, an X OR-gate, an XNOR-gate, and a tristate gate. Finally , using only two soldier s, he made the simplest gate, a NOT gate, or an inverter: Output a lways raised the flag that was opposite in color from th e one raised by Input. V on Neumann bowed to the em peror . “Now , Y our Imperial Majesty , all the gate components have been demonstrated. Aren’ t they simple? Any three soldiers can master the skills after one hour of training.” “Don’ t they need to learn more?” Qin Shi Huang asked. “No. W e can form ten million of these gates, and then put the components tog ether into a syst em. This system will then be able to carry out the calculations we need and work out those dif ferential equations for predicting the suns’ movements. W e could call the system … um…” “A computer ,” W ang said. “Ah, good!” V on Neumann gave W ang a thumbs-up. “Computerthat’ s a great name. The entire system is a lar ge machine, the most complex machine in the history of the world.”The passage of in-game time sped up. Three months went by . Qin Shi Huang, Newton, V on Neumann, and W ang all stood on the platform at the apex of the pyramid. This platform was simila r to the one where W ang had met Mozi. It was filled with astronomical i nstruments, some of which w ere of recent E uropean design. Below them, a magnificent phalanx of thirty million Qin soldiers was arrayed on the ground. The entire formation fit inside a square six kilometers on each side. As the sun rose, the phal anx rem ained still like a giant carpet made of thirty m illion terra- cotta warriors. But when a flock of birds wandered above the phalanx, the birds immediately felt the potential for death from below and scattered anxiously in chaos. W ang performed some computations in his head and realized that even if the entire population of Earth were arranged into such a p halanx, the whole formation would fit inside the Huangpu District of Shang hai. Though it was powerful, the phalanx also revealed the fragility of civilization. V on Neumann said, “Y our Imperial Majesty , your army is truly matchless. In an extremely short time, we have completed such complex training.” Qin Shi Huang held on to the hilt of his long sword. “Even though the whole is comple x, what each so ldier must do is very simple. Compared to the training they went through to learn how to break the M acedonian Phalanx, this is nothing.” Newton added, “And God blessed us with two consecutive Stable Eras to get them trained and ready .” “Even in a Chaotic Era, my ar my continues to train. They wi ll finish your cal culations even if it’ s a Chaotic Era.” Qin Shi Huang glanced over the phalanx with pride in his eyes. “Then, Y our Imperial Majesty , please give the great order!” V on Neumann’ s voice trembled with excitement. Qin Shi Huang nodded. A guard ran over , grabbed the hilt of the emperor ’ s sword , and stepped backwards. The bronze sword was so long that it was impo ssible for the em peror himself to pull it out of th e scabbard. The guard knelt and handed the sword to the emperor . Qin Shi Huang lifted the sword to the sky , and shouted: “Computer Formation!” Four gia nt bronz e cauldrons at the corners of the platform came to life simultaneously with roaring flames. A group of soldiers standing on thesloping side of the pyramid facing the phalanx chanted in unison: “Computer Formation!” On the ground below , colors in the phalanx began to shift an d move. Complicated and detailed circui t patterns appeared and gradually filled the entire f ormation. T en minutes later , the army had made a thirty-six kilometer square computer motherboard. V on Neu mann pointed to the gi gantic human circuit below the pyramid and beg an to explain, “Y our Imperial Majesty , we have named this computer Qin I. Look, there in the center is the CPU, the core computing component, formed from your five best divisions. By referencing this diagram, you can locate the adders, registers, and stack memory . The part around i t that looks highly regu lar is the memory . When we built that part, we f ound that w e didn’ t have e nough soldiers. But luckily , the work done by t he elements in this component is the simplest, so we t rained each soldier to hold more colored flags. Each man can now complete the work that initially required twenty me n. This allowed us to increase the memory capacity to meet the minimum requirements for running the Qin 1.0 operating system . Observe also the open passage that runs through the entire formation , and the light cavalry waiting for orders in that passage: That’ s th e system bus, responsible for transmitting information between the components of the whole system. “The bus architecture is a grea t invention. New plug-in components, which can be m ade from up to ten divisions, can quickly be added to the main operation bus. This allows Qin I’ s hardware to be easily expanded and upgraded. Look further stillyou might have to use the telescop e for this and the re’ s the external storage, which we call the ‘hard drive’ at Copernicus’ s su ggestion. It’ s formed by three million soldiers with more education than most. When you buried all those scholars alive after you unified C hina, it’ s a good thing you saved these ones! Each of t hem holds a pen and a notepad, and they’re responsible for recording the results of the calculations. Of course, the bulk of their work is to act as virtual memory and store intermediate calculat ion results. They’re the bottleneck for the speed of computation. And, finally , the part that’ s closest to us is the display . It’ s capable of showing us in real time the most important parameters of the computation.”V on Neumann and Newton carri ed over a lar ge scroll, tall as a man, and spread i t open before Qin Shi H uang. When they reached the scroll’ s end, W ang’ s chest tightened, rememb ering the legend of the assassin who hid a dagger in a map scroll that he then displayed to the emperor . But the imaginary dagger did not appear . Before them was only a lar ge sheet of paper filled with symbols, each the size of a fly’ s head. Packed so densely , the sym bols we re as dazzling to behold as the computer forma tion on the ground below . “Y our Imperial Majesty , this is the Qin 1.0 operating system we developed. The software for do ing the calculations will run o n top of it. That be low”V on Neumann pointed to the human-formation computer “is the hardware. What’ s on this paper is the software. The relationship between hardware and software is like that between the guqin zither and sheet music.” He a nd Newton then spread op en another scroll, just as lar ge . “Y our Imperial Majesty , this is the software for using numerical meth ods to solve those dif ferential equations. After entering the motion vectors of the three suns at a particular moment o btained by astronomical observation, the software’ s operation will give us a prediction for the suns’ subsequent motion at any moment in the future. Our first computation will calculate all the suns’ positions for the next t wo years. Each set of output values will be one hundred and twenty hours apart.” Qin Shi Huang nodded. “Good. Begin.” V on Neu mann lifted both hands above his head and solemnly chanted: “As ordered by the great emperor , turn on the computer! System self-test!” A ro w of soldiers standing ha lfway down the face of the pyramid repeated the order using flag si gnals. In a moment, the motherboard made of thirty million men seemed to turn into a lake filled with sparkling lights. T ens of millions of tiny flags waved. In the display formation c losest to the base of the pyramid, a progress bar made of numerous green flags slowly advanced, indic ating the percentage of the self-test that had been completed. T en minutes later , the progress bar reached its end. “Self-test complete! Begin boot sequence! Load operating system!” Below , the light cavalry on the main bus that passed through the entire human-formation computer began to move swiftly . The mai n bus soon turned into a turbulent river . Along the way , the river fed into numerous thintributaries, infilt rating all the modular subformations. Soon, the ripple of black and white flags coalesced into sur ging waves that fille d the entire motherboard. The central CPU area was the most tumultuous, like gunpowder on fire. But sudd enly , as though the pow der had been exhausted, the movements in th e C PU slack ened and eventually stopped. Starting with the CPU in the center , the stillness spread in every direction, like a sea being frozen over . Finally , the entire motherboard came to a stop, with only a few scattered components flas hing lifelessly in infinite loops. The center of the display formation blinked red. “System lockup!” a signal of ficer called out. Shortly after , the reason for the m alfunction was determined : There was an error with the operation of one of the gates in the CPU status register . “Restart system!” V on Neumann ordered confidently . “W ait!” Newton stopped the signal of ficer . He turned with an insidious expression and said to Qin Shi Huang, “Y our Imperial Majesty , in order to improve system stability , you should take certain maintenance measures with respect to faulty components.” Qin Shi Huang g rasped his sword and said, “Replace the malfun ctioning component and behead all the so ldiers who made up that gate. In the future, any malfunctions will be dealt with the same way!” V on Neu mann glanced at Newton, disgusted. They watched as a few riders dashed into the motherboa rd with their swords unsheathed. After they “repaired” the faulty component, the order to restart was given . This time, the operation went very smoothly . T wenty minutes later , Thr ee Body ’ s V on Neumann architecture human-formation computer had begun full operations under the Qin 1.0 operating system. “Run solar orbit computation software ‘Three Body 1.0’!” Newton screamed at the top of his lungs. “Start the master computing m odule! Load the dif ferential calculus module! Load the finite element analysis module! Load the spectral method modul e! Enter initial condition parameters … and begin calculation!” The motherboard sparkled as the display formation flashed with indicators in every color . The human-formation computer began the long computation.“This is really interesting,” Q in Shi Huang said, pointing to the spectacular sigh t. “Each individual’ s behavior is so simple, yet together , they can produce such a comple x, great whole! Europeans criticize me for my tyrannical rule, claiming that I suppress creativity . But in reality , a lar ge number of men yoked by severe discipline can also produce great wisdom when bound together as one.” “Great First Emperor , this is just the mechanical operation of a machine, not wisdom. Each of these lowly individuals is just a zero. Only when someone like you is added to the front as a one can the who le have any meaning.” Newton’ s smile was ingratiating. “Disgusting philosophy!” V on N eumann said as he glanced at Newton. “If, in the end, the results computed in accordance with your theory and mathematical model don’ t match reality , then you and I aren’ t even zeroes.” “Indeed. If that turns out to be the case, you will be nothing!” Qin Shi Huang turned and left the scene. * * * T ime passed quickly . The hum an-formation computer operated for a year and four months. Subtracting ou t the time spent to adjust the pr ogramming, the actual processing time wa s approximately a year and tw o months. During t his time , processing had to be stopped twice due to ex tremely bad weather in Chaotic Eras. But th e computer stored the data at the time of each shutdown, and was able to resume calculations successfully after the pauses. B y the time Qin Shi Hua ng and the European scholars a scended the pyramid again, the first phase of the computation was complete. The results precisely described the orbits of the three suns for the next two years. It w as a chilly dawn. The torches that had kept the motherb oard lit through the night were exting uished. After the final calculation, Qin I entered standby mode. The turbulent waves over the motherboard settled into light ripples. V on Neu mann and Newton presented the scroll with the results of the computation to Qin Shi Huang . Newton said, “Great First E mperor , the calculations wer e completed three days ago. W e waited until now to present the r esults to yo u because they s how that the long night is about to be over . W e’ll soon welcome the first sunrise of a long Stable Era, which will lastmore than a year . Judging by the orbital parameters, the climate will be extremely mild and comfortable. Please revive your empire and order everyone to be rehydrated.” “Ever since the start of this computation, my empire has nev er been dehydrated,” Qin Shi Huang said in a huf f, grabbing the scroll. “I’ve devoted all the resources of the Qin Empire to maintain the oper ation of the computer , and we’ve run out of stored supplies. For this computer , countless people have died of hunger , cold, and heat.” Qin pointed into the distance with the scroll. By the d im dawn light, they could see tens of white lines ra diating from the edges of the motherboard in every direction, disappearing over the horizon. These were the supply routes from every corner of the empire. “Y our Im perial Majesty , you will find that the sacrifices are worth it,” V on Neumann said. “After mastering the orbits of the suns, Qin will develop by leaps and bounds, and will grow many times more powerful than before.” “According to the calculations, the sun is about to rise. Gre at First Emperor , prepare to receive your glory!” As if in response to Newton’ s w ords, a sliver of red sun peeked over the horizon, bathing the pyramid and the human-formation com puter in a golden light. A wave of joyous cries rose from the motherboard. A man hurried toward them. H e was running so fast that, as he knelt down, he couldn’ t catch his b reath. He was the emperor ’ s astronomy minister . “Sire, the calculations were in error . Disaster is about to befall us!” “What are you b abbling about?” W ithout even waiting for the emperor to sp eak, Newton kicked the m an. “Don’ t you see that the sun is rising at the exact moment predicted by our precise calculations?” “But…” The minister half straightened, one hand pointing at the sun. “How many suns do you see?” Everyone gazed at the rising sun, confused. “Minister , you re ceived a proper W estern education and obtained a doctorate from the University of Cambridge,” V o n Neumann said. “Y ou must at least know how to count. Of course there’ s only one sun in the sky . And the temperature is very comfortable.”“No. There are three!” The minister cried, tears flowing from his face. “The other two are behind that one!” Everyone stared at the sun again, still confused. “The Im perial Observatory has confirmed that right now we are experiencing th e extremely rare phenomenon of a tri-solar syzygy . The three suns are i n a straight line, moving around our planet at the same angular speed! Thus, our planet and the three suns are in a straight line with our world at the end!” “Y ou’re certain that the observation is not in error?” Newton grabbed the collar of the astronomy minister . “Absolutely certain. The observation was conducted by the W estern astronomers of the Imperial Observatory , including Kepler and Herschel. They’re using the lar gest telescope in the world, imported from Europe.” Newton let go o f the minister and stood up. W ang saw that his face was pale, but his expression was on e of pure joy . He clasped his tw o hands in front of his chest and said to Qin Shi Huang, “Oh Greatest, Most Honorable Emperor , this is the most propitious sign of them all! Now th at the three suns are orbiting around our planet, your empire is the center of the universe. This is God’ s reward for our ef forts. Let me check the calculations one more time. I will prove this!” While th e rest remained stunne d, Newton slipped away . Later , others would report that Sir Isaac had stolen a horse and left for parts unknown. An a nxiety-filled moment of silence later , W ang suddenly said, “Y our Imperial Majesty , please unsheathe your sword.” “What d o you want?” Qin Shi H uang asked, baf fled. But he ge stured at the soldier by his side, and the soldier pulled the sword out of its scabbard. W ang said, “Please try to swing it.” Qin Shi Huang held the sword and waved it around. His expression turned to one of surprise. “Oh, why is it so light?” “The ga me’ s V - suit cannot simulate the feeling of diminished gravity . Otherwise we’d feel that we’re much lighter as well.” “Look! Down there! Look at the horses, and the men!” Someone cried out. Eve ryone lo oked down and saw a column of cavalry moving at the foot of the pyramid. All the horses seemed to be floating. Each horse drifted over a long distance before the four hooves struck ground again. They also saw sev eral run ning men. W ith each step, the men leapt a do zen meters,falling slowly back to the ground. On top of the pyramid, a soldier tried to jump up, and easily reached the height of three meters. “What is going on?” Qin Shi Huang looked at the soldier slowly falling back down. “Sire, the three suns are over our planet in a straight line, so their gravitational for ces are added to gether .…” The astronomy mini ster tried to explain, but discovered that his two feet had already left the ground and he was now horizo ntal. The others were also floating in the air , leaning at dif ferent angles. Like a bunch of men who had fallen into wa ter without knowing how to swim, they clumsily waved their limbs, trying to stabilize themselves but colliding into each other instead. The gro und they had just left now cracked open like a spiderweb. The cracks grew fast, and, accom panied by thunderous crashes and sky- obscuring dust, the pyramid below them broke into its constituent blocks. Through the slowly drifting g igantic blocks, W ang saw the Great Hall below come apart. The lar ge cauldron that had once cooked Fu Xi and the iron stake to which he had once been bound were both adrift. The sun rose to the middle of the sky . Everything that floated men, colossal blocks of stone, astronomical instruments, bronze cauldrons began t o rise slowly , then ac celerated. W ang glanced at the human- formation computer and saw a nightmarish sight: The thirty million men who had formed the motherboard were floating away from th e earth and rising, li ke a swarm of ants su cked up by a vacuum cleaner . The ground they left behind clearly displayed the marks of the motherboard circuits. The set of intricate, complex markings that could only be taken in from a great he ight would become an archaeological site that would confuse the next Thr ee Body civilization, in the distant future. W ang lo oked up . The sky was obscured by a strangely mottled layer of clouds. T he clou ds were made o f dust, stones, humans, and oth er odds and ends. The sun sparkled behind them. In the far distance, W ang saw a long range of transparent mountains also rising up. The mountains were crystal clear , and changed shapes as they sparkledthey were formed from the ocean, which was also being attracted into space. Everything on the surface of the Thr ee Body world rose toward the sun. W ang lo oked aro und and saw V on Neumann and Qin Shi Huan g. As he drifted, V on Neumann shouted a t Qin Shi Huang, but there was no sound. Asmall set of subt itles appeared: I fig ur ed it out! Electr onic eleme nts! W e can use electr onic elements to make gate cir cuits and combine them into computers! Such computers will be many times faster and take u p much less space. I estimate that a small building will be sufficient.… Y o ur Imperial Majesty , ar e you listening? Qin Shi Huang swung his long sword at V on Neumann. The latter kicked at a giant block of stone drifting nearby and dodged out of the way . The long sword struck the stone , causing sparks to fly , and broke itself into two piec es. Righ t after , the gian t block of stone collided with another , with Qin Shi Huang in the middle. Stone chips and flesh and blood scattered everywhere, an appalling sight. But W ang did not hear the noise made by colliding stones. Around him it was complete ly silent. Because the atmosphere was gone, there was no more so und. As the bodies drif ted, their blood boiled in the vacuum and their inner or gans were vomite d out, until they turned into strange blobs surrounded by crystalline cloud s made from the liquid they exuded. Also, due to the lack of an atmosphere, the sky turned pitch black. Everything that had floated into space from the Three Body world reflected the sunlight and formed a brilliant, starry cloud i n space. The cloud then turned into a giant vortex, spiraling toward its final resting place: the sun. W ang now saw the sun chang ing shape. He understood that he was actually seeing the other two suns, both peeking out from behind the first sun. From this p erspective, the three stacked suns formed a brigh t eye in the universe. Against the background of the three suns in syzygy , text appeared: Civilization Number 184 was destroyed by the stacked gravitational attractions of a tri- solar syzyg y . This civilization had advanced to the Scientific Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. In thi s civilization, N ewton established nonrelativistic classical mechanics. At the sam e time, due to the invention of calculus an d the V on Neumann architecture computer , the foundation was set for the quantitative mathematical analysis of the motion of three bodies. After a long time, life and civilization will begin once more, and progress through the unpredictable world of Thr ee Body . W e invite you to log on again.* * * Just as W ang lo gged out of the game, a stranger called. The voice on the phone was that of a very charis matic man. “Hello! First, we thank you for giving us your r eal number . I’m a system administrator for the Thr ee Body game.” W ang was both excited and anxious. “Please tell us your age, educat ion, employer , and position. Y ou didn’ t fill those out when you registered.” “What do they have to do with the game?” “When you’ve reached this le vel, you must provide these p ieces of information. If you refuse, Thr ee Body will be permanently closed to you.” W ang answered the administrator ’ s questions truthfully . “V ery go od, Professor W ang.

中国科幻基石丛书 168 19．聚 会 《三体》网友的聚会地点是一处僻静的小咖啡厅。在汪淼的印象 中，这个时代的游戏网友聚会都是人数众多的热闹盛会，但这次来的连 自己在内也只有七个人，而那六位，同自己一样，不论怎么看都不像游 戏爱好者。比较年轻的只有两位，另外五位，包括一位女士，都是中年 人，还有一个老者，看上去有六七十岁了。 汪淼本以为大家一见面就会对《三体》展开热烈的讨论，但现在发 现自己想错了。 《三体》那诡异而深远的内涵，己对其参与者产生了很 深的心理影响，使得每个人，包括汪淼自己，都很难轻易谈起它。大家只 是简单地相互做了自我介绍，那位老者，掏出一把很精致的烟斗，装上 烟丝抽了起来，踱到墙边去欣赏墙上的油画。其他人则都坐着等待聚会 组织者的到来，他们都来得早了。 其实这六个人中，汪淼有两个已经认识。那位鹤发童颜的老者，是 一位著名学者，以给东方哲学赋予现代科学内涵而闻名。那位穿着怪异 的女士，是著名作家，是少见的风格前卫却拥有众多读者的小说家，她 写的书，从哪一页开始看都行。其他四位，两名中年人，一位是国内最大 软件公司的副总裁（穿着朴素随意，丝毫看不出来） ，另一位是国家电 力公司的高层领导；两名年轻人，一位是国内大媒体的记者，另一位是 在读的理科博士生。汪淼现在意识到， 《三体》的玩家，可能相当一部分 是他们这样的社会精英。 聚会的组织者很快来了，汪淼见到他，心跳骤然加快，这人竟是潘 寒，杀死申玉菲的头号嫌疑人。他悄悄掏出手机，在桌下给大史发短信。 地球往事 三体 169 “呵呵，大家来得真早！ ”潘寒轻松地打招呼，似乎什么事都没有 发生。他一改往常在媒体上那副脏兮兮的流浪汉模样，西装革履，显得 风度翩翩， “你们和我想象的差不多，都是精英人士， 《三体》就是为你 们这样的阶层准备的，它的内涵和意境，常人难以理解；玩它所需要的 知识，其层次之高，内容之深，也是常人不可能具备的。 ” 汪淼的短信已经发出：见到潘寒，在西城区云河咖啡馆。 潘寒接着说： “在座的各位都是《三体》的优秀玩家，成绩最好，也 都很投入。我相信， 《三体》已成为你们生活中的一部分。 ” “是生命中的一部分。 ”那位年轻的博士生说。 “我是从孙子的电脑上偶然看到它的， ”老哲学家翘着烟斗柄说， “年轻人玩了几下就放弃了，说太深奥。我却被它吸引，那深邃的内涵， 诡异恐怖又充满美感的意境，逻辑严密的世界设定，隐藏在简洁表象下 海量的信息和精确的细节， 都令我们着迷。 ” 包括汪淼在内的几位网友 都连连点头。这时汪淼收到了大史回的短信：我们也看到他了，没事，该 干什么干什么。注意，在他们面前你要尽量表现得极端些，但不要太过 了，那样装不像。 “是的， ”女作家点头赞同， “从文学角度看， 《三体》也是卓越的， 那二百零三轮文明的兴衰，真是一首首精美的史诗。 ” 她提到二百零三轮文明，而汪淼经历的是一百九十一轮，这让汪淼 再次确信了一点： 《三体》对每个玩家都有一个独立的进程。 “我对现实世界真有些厌倦了， 《三体》已成为我的第二现实。 ”年 轻的记者说。 “是吗？”潘寒很有兴趣地插问一句。 “我也是，与《三体》相比，现实是那么的平庸和低俗。 ” IT副总裁 说。 “可惜啊，只是个游戏。 ”国电公司领导说。 “很好。 ”潘寒点点头，汪淼注意到他眼中放出兴奋的光来。 “有一个问题，我想是我们大家都渴望知道的。 ”汪淼说。 中国科幻基石丛书 170 “我知道是什么，不过你问吧。 ”潘寒说。 “ 《三体》仅仅是个游戏吗？ ” 网友们纷纷点头，显然这也是他们急切想问的。 潘寒站起来，郑重地说： “三体世界是真实存在的。 ” “在哪里？ ”几个网友异口同声地问。 潘寒坐下，沉默良久才开口： “有些问题我能够回答，有些不能，但 如果各位与三体世界有缘，总有一天所有的问题都能得到解答。 ” “那么，游戏中是否表现了三体世界的某些真实成分呢？ ”记者问。 “首先，在很多轮文明中，三体人的脱水功能是真实的，为了应对 变幻莫测的自然环境，他们随时可以将自己体内的水分完全排出，变成 干燥的纤维状物体，以躲过完全不适合生存的恶劣气候。 ” “三体人是什么样子的？ ” 潘寒摇摇头： “不知道，真的不知道。每一轮文明中，三体人的外形 都完全不同，另外，游戏中还反映了一个三体世界中的真实存在：人列 计算机。 ” “哈， 我觉得那是最不真实的！ ”IT副总裁说， “我用公司的上百名 员工进行过一个简单的测试，即使这想法真能实现，人列计算机的运算 速度可能比一个人的手工计算都慢。 ” 潘寒露出神秘的笑容说： “不错， 但假如构成计算机的三千万个士 兵，每个人在一秒钟内可以挥动黑白小旗十万次，总线上的轻骑兵的奔 跑速度是几倍音速甚至更快，结果就不一样了。你们刚才问过三体人的 外形，据一些迹象推测，构成人列计算机的三体人，外表可能覆盖着一 层全反射镜面，这种镜面可能是为了在恶劣的日照条件下生存而进化 出来的，镜面可以变化出各种形状，他们之间就通过镜面聚焦的光线来 交流，这种光线语言信息传输的速度是很快的，这就是人列计算机得以 存在的基础。当然，这仍是一台效率很低的机器，但确实能够完成人类 手工力不能及的运算。计算机在三体世界首先确实是以人列形式出现， 然后才是机械式和电子式的。 ” 地球往事 三体 171 潘寒站起来，围着网友们的背后踱步： “我现在能告诉大家的只 是：作为一个游戏， 《三体》只是借用人类的背景来模拟三体世界的发 展，这样做只是为游戏者提供一个熟悉的环境，真实的三体世界与游戏 中的差别很大，但其中三颗太阳的存在是真实的，这是三体世界自然结 构的基础。 ” “开发这个游戏肯定花费了很大的力量，但它的目的显然不是赢 利。 ” IT副总裁说。 “《三体》 游戏的目的很单纯， 就是为了聚集起我们这样志同道合 的人。 ”潘寒说。 “什么志和什么道呢？”汪淼问，但旋即有些后悔，仔细想着自己 的问题是否露出了些许的敌意。 这个问题果然令潘寒沉默下来，他用意味深长的目光将在座的每 个人逐个打量了一遍，轻轻地说： “如果三体文明要进入人类世界，你 们是什么态度？ ” “我很高兴， ”年轻的记者首先打破沉默说， “这些年看到的事，让 我对人类已经失望了，人类社会已经无力进行自我完善，需要一个外部 力量的介入。 ” “同意！ ”女作家大声说，她很激动，似乎终于找到了一个发泄某种 东西的机会， “人类是什么？多么丑恶的东西，我上半生一直在用文学这 把解剖刀来揭露这种丑恶，现在连这种揭露都厌倦了。我向往着三体文 明能把真正的美带到这个世界上来。 ” 潘寒没有说话，那种兴奋的光芒又在双眼中亮起来。 老哲学家挥着已经熄灭的烟斗， 一脸严重地说： “让我们来稍微深 入地探讨一下这个问题：你们对阿兹特克文明有什么印象？ ” “黑暗而血腥，丛林中阴森的火光照耀着鲜血流淌的金字塔。这就 是我对它的印象。 ”女作家说。 哲学家点点头： “很好，那么想象一下，假如后来没有西班牙人的 介入，这个文明会对人类历史产生什么影响？ ” 中国科幻基石丛书 172 “你这是颠倒黑白， ”IT副总裁指着哲学家说， “那时入侵美洲的 西班牙人不过是强盗和凶手！ ” “就算如此，他们至少制止了下面事情的发生：阿兹特克无限制地 发展，把美洲变成一个血腥和黑暗的庞大帝国，那时美洲和全人类的民 主和文明时代就要更晚些到来，甚至根本就不会出现。这就是问题的关 键之处不管三体文明是什么样子，它们的到来对病入膏肓的人类 文明总是个福音。 ” “那您想过没有， 阿兹特克文明最后被西方入侵者毁灭了。 ”国 电 公司领导说，同时环视了一下四周，仿佛是第一眼见到这些人， “这里 的思想很危险。 ” “是深刻！ ”博士生举起一根手指说，同时对哲学家连连点头， “我 也有这个想法，但不知道如何表达，您说得太好了。 ” 一阵沉默后，潘寒转向汪淼： “他们六人已经表明了自己的态度， 您呢？ ” “我站在他们一边。 ”汪淼指指记者和哲学家等人说。言多必失，他 只是简单地答这一句。 “很好。 ”潘寒说着，转向了 IT副总裁和国电公司领导， “你们二 位，已经不适合这场聚会了，也不适合继续玩《三体》游戏。你们的 ID 将被注销，下面请你们离开。谢谢你们的到来，请！ ” 两人站起身来对视一下，又困惑地看看周围，转身走出门去。 潘寒向剩下的五个人伸出手来，挨个与他们紧紧握手。最后庄严地 说： “我们，是同志了。 ”,"1 8 M e e t - u p The location for the Thr ee Body players’ meet-up was a small, out-of-the- way cof fee shop. W ang had a lways imagined game meet-up s would be lively events full of people, b ut this meet-up consisted of only seven players, including himself. Lik e W ang, the other six did not look like gaming enthusiasts. Only two were relatively young. Another three, including a woman, were middle-aged. There was also an old man who appeared to be in his sixties or seventies. W ang h ad origi nally thought that as soon as they met they’d begin a lively discussion of Thr ee Body , but he was wrong. The prof ound but strange content of Thr ee Body h ad had a psychological imp act on the participants. All the players, including W ang himself, couldn’ t bring it up easily . They only made simple self-introductions. The old man took out a refined pipe, filled it with tobacco, and smoked as he strolled around, admiring the paintings on the walls. The others sat silently , waiting for the meet-up or ganizer to show up. They had all come early . Actually , of the six, W ang alread y knew two. The old man was a famous scholar who had made his nam e by imbuing Eastern philosophy with the content of modern science. The strangely dressed woman was a famous writer , o ne of those rare novelist s who wrote in an avant-garde style but still had many readers. Y ou could start one of her books on any page. Of th e tw o midd le-aged men, one was a vice president at China’ s lar gest software company , plainly and casually dressed so that his status wasn’ tobvious at all; a nd the other wa s a high-level executive at the State Power Corporation. Of the two young men, one was a reporter with a major media outlet, and the other was a do ctoral student in the sciences. W ang now realized that a considerable number of Thr ee Body p layers were probably social elites like them. The meet-up or ganizer showed up not long after . W ang’ s heart began to beat faster as soon as he saw the man: it was Pan Han, prime suspect for the murder o f Shen Y ufei. He took out his phone when no one was looking and texted Shi Qiang. “Haha, everyone got here early!” Pan greeted them in a relaxed manner , as though nothing was wrong. Appearing in the media, he usually looked disheveled, like a vagrant, but today , he was dressed sharply in a suit and dress sh oes. “Y ou’re just like I imagined. Thr ee Body is intended for people in your class because the common crowd cannot appreciate its meaning and mood. T o play it well requires knowledge and understanding th at ordinary people do not possess.” W ang sent out his text: Spotted Pan Han. At Y unhe C offee Shop in Xicheng District. Pan continued. “Everyone here is an excellent Thr ee Body player . Y ou have the best scores and are devoted to it. I believe that Thr ee Body is already an important part of your lives.” “It’ s part of what keeps me alive,” the young doctoral student said. “I sa w it by accident on my gra ndson’ s computer ,” the old phi losopher said, lift ing his pipe stem. “The young man abandoned it after a few tries, saying it was too abstruse. But I was attracted to it. I find it strange, terrible, but also beautiful. So much information is hidden beneat h a simple representation.” A few players nodded at this description, including W ang himself. W ang received Da Shi’ s reply text: W e a lso see him . No worries. C arry on. Play the fanatic in fr ont of them, but not so much that you can’ t pull it off. “Y es,” t he author agreed, and nodded. “I like the literary elements of Thr ee Body . T he rises and f alls of two hundred and three civilizations evoke the qualities of epics in a new form.” She men tioned 203 civilization s, but W ang had only experienc ed 184. This told W ang that Thr ee Body p rogres sed independently for each player ,possibly with dif ferent worlds. “I’m a bit sick o f the real world ,” the young reporter said. “ Thr ee Body is already my second reality .” “Really?” Pan asked, interested. “Me too,” the software compa ny vice president said. “Compared to Thr ee Body , reality is so vulgar and unexciting.” “It’ s too bad that it’ s only a game,” said the power company executive. “V ery good,” Pan said. W ang noticed his eyes sparkling with excitement. “I ha ve a question that I think everyone wants to know the answer to,” W ang said. “I know what it is. But you might as well ask.” “ Is Thr ee Body only a game?” The other players nodded. Clearly the question was also on their minds. Pan stood up and said solem nly , “The world of Thr ee Body , or T risolaris, really does exist.” “Where is it?” several players asked in unison. After lo oking at each of them in turn, Pan sat down and spoke. “Some questions I can answer . Others I cannot. But if you are meant to be with T risolaris, all your questions will be answered someday .” “Then … does the game rea lly portray T risolaris accurately?” the reporter asked. “First, the ability of T risolarans to dehydrate through its many cycles of civilization is real. In order to adapt to the unpredictable natural environment and avoid extrem e environmental conditions un suitable for life, they can completely expel the water in their bodies and tu rn into dry , fibrous objects.” “What do T risolarans look like?” Pan shook his head. “I don’ t know . I really don’ t. In every cycle of civilization, the appearance of T risolarans is dif ferent. However , the game does portray something else that really existed on T risolaris: the T risolaran- formation computer .” “Ha! I thought that was the most unrealistic aspect,” the software company vice president said. “I conducted a test with more than a hundred employees at my company . Even if the idea worked, a computer made ofpeople would probably operate at a speed slower than manual computation.” Pan gav e a mysterious smile. “Y ou’re right. But suppose tha t of the thirty m illion soldiers forming the computer , each one is capab le of raising and lowering the black and w hite flags a hundred thousand times per second, and suppose also that the light cavalry soldiers on the main bus can run at several times the speed of sound, or even faster . Then the result would be very dif ferent. “Y ou asked about the appearanc e of the T risolarans just now . According to so me signs, th e bodies of the T risolarans who formed the computer were covered by a purely reflective surface, which probably evolved as a response to survival under extr eme conditions of sunlight. The mirrorlike surface could be deformed into any shape, and they communicated with each oth er by focusing light w ith their bodies. This kind of light-speech could tra nsmit information extre mely rapidly and was the foundation of the T risolaran-formation computer . Of course, this was still a very inef ficient machine, but it was capable of completing calculations that were too dif ficult to be performed manually . The computer did in fact make its first appearance in T risolaris as formations of people, before becoming mechanical and then electronic.” Pan stoo d up and paced behind the players. “As a game, Thr ee Body only borrows the background of human society to simulate the development of T risolaris. This is done to give players a familiar environment. The real T risolaris is very dif ferent from the world of the game, but the existence of the three suns is real. They’re the foundation of the T risolaran environment.” “Developing thi s game must have cost an enormous amount of ef fort,” the vice president said. “But the goal is clearly not profit.” “The go al of Thr ee Body i s very simple a nd pure: to gather those of us who have common ideals,” Pan said. “What i deals do we have in common, exactly?” W ang imm ediately regretted the question. He wondered whether asking it sounded hostile. Pan studied everyone meaning fully , and then added in a soft voice, “How would you feel if T risolaran civilization were to enter our world?” “I w ould be ha ppy .” The young reporter was the first to b reak the silence. “I’ve lost hope in the human race after what I’ve seen in recentyears. Human society is incapa ble of self-improvement, and we need the intervention of an outside force.” “I agree!” the a uthor shouted. She was very excited, as though finally finding an outlet for pent-up f eelings. “The human race is hideous. I’ve spent the first half of my life unveiling this ugliness with th e scalpel of literature, but now I’m even s ick of the work of dissection. I yearn for T risolaran civilization to bring real beauty to this world.” Pan said nothing. That glint of excitement appeared in his eyes again. The old philosop her waved his p ipe, which had gone out. He spoke with a ser ious mien. “Let’ s discuss this question with a bit more dep th: What is your impression of the Aztecs?” “Dark and bloody ,” the author said. “Blood-drenched pyramid s lit by insidious fires seen through dark forests. Those are my impressions.” The philosophe r nodded. “V ery good. Then try to imagine: If the Spanish Conquistadors did no t intervene, what would have been the influence of that civilization on human history?” “Y ou’re calling black white an d white black,” the software c ompany vice pre sident said. “The Conquistadors who invaded the Americas were nothing more than murderers and robbers.” “Even so, at lea st they prevented the Aztecs from developing without bound, turning the Americas into a bloody , dark great empire. Then civilization as we know it wou ldn’ t have appeared in the Americas, and democracy wouldn’ t have thrived until much later . Indeed, maybe they wouldn’ t have appeared at all. This is the key to the question: No matter what the T risolarans are like, their arrival will be good news for the terminally ill human race.” “But have you thought through the fact that the Aztecs were com pletely destroyed by the W estern invaders?” the power company executive asked. He look ed aroun d, as though se eing these people for the first time. “Y our thoughts are very dangerous.” “Y ou mean profound!” the doc toral student said, raising a fin ger . He nodded vigorous ly at the philos opher . “I had the same thought, but I didn’ t know how to express it. Y ou said it so well!” After a moment of silence, Pan turned to W ang. “The other six have all given their views. What about you?”“I s tand with them,” W ang s aid, pointing to the reporter and the philosopher . He kept his answer simple. The less said the better . “V ery good,” Pan said. He t urned to the software company vice president and the power compan y executive. “The two of you are no longer welcome at this meet-up, and you are no longer appropriate players for Thr ee Body . Y our IDs will be deleted. Please leave now . Thank you.” The two stood up and looked at each other; then glanced around, confused, and left. Pan held out his hand to the remaining five, shaking each person’ s hand in turn. Then he said, solemnly , “W e are comrades now .”"
地球往事 三体 173 20．三体、爱因斯坦、 单摆、 大撕裂 汪淼第五次进入《三体》时，黎明中的世界已面目全非。前四次均 出现的大金字塔已在“三日连珠”中毁灭，在那个位置上出现了一座高 大的现代建筑。这幢黑色大楼的样子汪淼很熟悉，那是联合国大厦。 远处的大地上，星罗棋布着许多显然是干仓的高大建筑，都有着全反射 的镜面表面，在晨光中像大地上生长的巨型水晶植物。 汪淼听见一阵小提琴声，好像是莫扎特的一首曲子，拉得不熟练， 但有一种很特别的韵味，仿佛时时在说明，这是拉给自己听的，而自己 也很欣赏。琴声来自坐在大厦正门台阶上的一位流浪老人，他蓬松的银 发在风中飘着，他脚下放了一顶破礼帽，里面好像已经有人放了些零 钱。 汪淼突然发现日出了，但太阳是从与晨光相反方向的地平线下升 起的，那里的天穹还是一片漆黑的夜空，太阳升起之前没有任何晨光。 太阳很大，升出一半的日轮占据了三分之一的地平线。汪淼的心跳加快 了，这么大的太阳，只能意味着又一次大毁灭。但他回头看时，见那位老 人仍若无其事地坐在那儿拉琴，他的银发在太阳的光芒中像燃烧起来 似的。 这太阳就是银色的，与老人头发一样的颜色，它将一片银光撒向大 地，但汪淼从这光芒中感觉不到一点儿暖意。他看看已经完全升出地平 线的太阳，从那发出银光的巨盘上，他清晰地看到了木纹状的图形，那 是固态的山脉。汪淼明白了，它本身不发光，只是反射从另一个方向发 出晨光的真太阳的光芒，升起来的不是太阳，而是一个巨型月亮！巨月 中国科幻基石丛书 174 运行得很快，以肉眼可以察觉的速度掠过长空，在这个过程中，它逐渐 由满月融缺成半月，然后又变成了月牙，老人舒缓的小提琴声在寒冷的 晨风中飘荡，宇宙中壮丽的景象仿佛就是那音乐的物化，汪淼陶醉于美 的震慑之中。巨大月牙在晨光中落下，这时它的亮度增长了很多，当它 只剩两个银光四射的尖角在地平线之上时，汪淼突然将其想象成一头 正在奔向太阳的宇宙巨牛的两只犄角。 “尊敬的哥白尼，停一停您匆忙的脚步吧，这样您欣赏一曲莫扎 特，我也就有了午饭。 ”巨月完全落下后，老人抬起头来说。 “如果我没认错”汪淼看着那张满是皱纹的脸说，那些皱纹都 很长，曲线也很柔和，像在努力造就一种和谐。 “您没认错，我是爱因斯坦，一个对上帝充满信仰却被他抛弃的可 怜人。 ” “刚才那个大月亮是怎么回事？我前几次来没有见过它。 ” “它已经凉下来了。 ” “谁？” “大月亮啊，我小时候它还热着，升到中天时能看到核心平原上的 红光，现在凉下来了……你没听说过大撕裂吗？” “没有，怎么回事？” 爱因斯坦叹息着摇摇头： “不提了，往事不堪回首，我的过去，文明 的过去，宇宙的过去，都不堪回首啊！ ” “您怎么落到这个地步？”汪淼掏掏口袋，真的掏出了一些零钱，他 弯腰将钱放到帽子里。 “谢谢哥白尼先生，但愿上帝不抛弃您吧，不过我对此没有信心。 我感觉，您和牛顿他们到东方用人列运算的那个模型，已很接近于正确 了，但所差的那么一点点，对牛顿或其他的人来说是一道不可逾越的鸿 沟。我一直认为，没有我，别人也会发现狭义相对论，但广义相对论却不 是这样。牛顿差的那一点，就是广义相对论所描述的行星轨道的引力摄 动，它引起的误差虽然很小，但对计算结果却是致命的。在经典方程中 地球往事 三体 175 加入引力摄动的修正，就得到了正确的数学模型。它的运算量比你们在 东方完成的要大得多，但对现代计算机来说，真的不成问题。 ” “运算结果得到天文观测的证实了吗？” “要那样我会在这里吗？但从美学角度讲，我是没错的，错的是宇 宙。上帝抛弃了我，接着所有的人都抛弃了我，哪里都不要我，普林斯顿 撤销了我的教授职位，联合国教科文组织连个科学顾问的职位都不给 我，以前他们跪着求我我都不干呢；我甚至想去以色列当总统，可他们 说他们改变主意了，说我不过是个骗子，唉 ” 爱因斯坦说完又拉起了琴，很精确地从刚才的中断处拉起。汪淼听 了一会儿，迈步向大厦的大门走去。 “里面没有人，参加这届联大的所有人都在大厦后面参加单摆启动 仪式。 ”爱因斯坦拉着琴说。 汪淼绕过了大厦，来到它后面，立刻看到了一件不可思议的东西： 一架顶天立地的巨型单摆。其实在大厦前面就能看到它露出的一段，但 汪淼当时不知道是什么东西。这就是汪淼第一次进入《三体》时，在战 国时代的大地上看到的由伏羲建造的那种巨摆，用来给太阳神催眠。眼 前这架巨摆外形已经现代化，支撑天桥的两个高塔是全金属结构，每一 个都有埃菲尔铁塔那么高，摆锤也是金属的，呈流线型，表面是光滑的 电镀镜面，由于有了高强度材料，悬吊摆锤的线缆只有很细的一根，几 乎看不到，这使得摆锤看上去像是空悬在两座高塔之间的空中。 在巨摆之下有一群穿着西装的人，可能就是参加联大会议的各国 首脑了。他们三五成堆地低声聊着，好像在等待着什么。 “啊，哥白尼，跨越五个时代的人！ ”有人高声喊道，其他人纷纷对 他表示欢迎。 “而且，您是在那战国时代亲眼见过单摆的人！ ”一个面貌和善的 黑人握着汪淼的手说。有人介绍他是本届联合国秘书长。 “是的，我见过，可为什么现在又建起这东西？”汪淼问。 “它是三体纪念碑，也是一个墓碑。 ”秘书长仰望着半空中的摆锤 中国科幻基石丛书 176 说，从这里看去，它足有一个潜水艇那么大。 “墓碑？谁的？” “一个努力的，一个延续了近二百个文明的努力，为解决三体问题 的努力，寻找太阳运行规律的努力。 ” “这努力终结了吗？” “到现在为止，彻底终结了。 ” 汪淼犹豫了一下，拿出了一叠资料，这是魏成三体问题数学模型的 链接： “我……就是为此事而来的，我带来了一个解决三体问题的数学 模型，据信是很有可能成功。 ” 汪淼话一出口，发现周围的人立刻对他失去了兴趣，都离开他回 到自己的小圈子里继续刚才的聊天，他注意到有的人离开时还笑着摇摇 头。秘书长拿过了资料，看也没看就递给了旁边一位戴眼镜的瘦高的 人： “出于对您崇高威望的尊敬，请我的科学顾问看看吧。其实大家已 经对您表示了这种尊敬，换了别人，会立刻招来嘲笑的。 ” 科学顾问接过资料翻了翻： “进化算法？哥白尼，你是个天才，能搞 出这种算法的人都是天才，这除了高超的数学能力，还需要想象力。 ” “听您的意思，已经有人创造了这种数学模型？” “是的，还有其他几十种数学模型，其中一半以上比您这个要高明 得多，都被创造出来，并在计算机上完成了计算。在过去的两个世纪中， 这种巨量的计算是世界的中心活动，人们就像等待最后审判日那样等着 结果。 ” “结果呢？” “已经确切地证明，三体问题无解。 ” 汪淼仰望着巨大的摆锤，它在晨曦中晶莹光亮，作为一面变形的镜 子反映着周围的一切，仿佛是世界的眸子。在那已被许多个文明所隔开 的遥远时代，就在这片大地上，他和周文王曾穿过林立的巨摆走向纣王 的宫殿。历史就这样划了一个漫长的大圈，回到了最初的地方。 “正像我们早就猜测的那样，三体是一个混沌系统，会将微小的扰 地球往事 三体 177 动无限放大，其运行规律从数学本质上讲是不可预测的。 ”科学顾问 说。 汪淼感觉自己所有的科学知识和思想体系在一瞬间模糊不清了， 代之以前所未有的迷茫： “如果连三体这样极其简单的系统都处于不 可预知的混沌，那我们还怎样对探索复杂宇宙的规律抱有信心呢？” “上帝是个无耻的老赌徒，他抛弃了我们！ ”爱因斯坦不知什么时 候过来了，挥着小提琴说。 秘书长缓缓地点点头： “是的，上帝是个赌徒，那三体文明的唯一 希望，就是也赌一把了。 ” 这时，巨月又从黑夜一方的天边升起，它银色的巨像映在摆锤光滑 表面上，光怪陆离地蠕动着，仿佛摆锤和巨月两者之间产生了神秘的 心灵感应。 “您说到文明，这一个文明好像已经发展到相当的高度了。 ”汪淼 说。 “是的，掌握了核能，到了信息时代。 ”秘书长说，但对这一切似乎 不以为然。 “那就存在着这样一个希望：文明继续发展下去，达到另一个高 度，虽然不能得知太阳运行的规律，但能够在乱纪元生存下去，并且能 够抵御以前太阳异常运行造成的那些毁灭性的大灾难。 ” “以前人们都是这样想的，这也是三体文明前赴后继顽强再生的 动力之一，但它使我们认识到，这一想法是何等的天真。 ”秘书长指指 正在升起的巨月说， “你可能是第一次看到这个巨大的月亮，其实它几 乎有我们行星的四分之一大小，已经不是一个月亮，而是这颗行星的一 颗伴星了，它是大撕裂的产物。 ” “大撕裂？” “毁灭上一轮文明的大灾难。其实，与以前的文明相比，对这个灾 难的预警期还是相当长的。遗留的记载显示， 191号文明的天文学家 很早就观测到了‘飞星不动’ 。 ” 中国科幻基石丛书 178 听到最后四个字，汪淼心里一紧。 “飞星不动”是三体世界最大的 凶兆，飞星，或者说远方的太阳，从地面的观察角度看在宇宙的背景上 静止了，只意味太阳与行星在一条直线上运行。这有三种可能：一、 太阳与行星以相同的速度向同一方向运行；二、太阳正远离行星而去； 三、太阳正冲向行星而来。在 191号文明之前，这只是一种想象中的灾 难，从未真实发生过，但人们对它的恐惧和警觉丝毫没有放松，以至于 “飞星不动”成了多个三体文明中的一句最不吉利的咒语。即使只有一 颗飞星静止，也让人不寒而栗。 “当时， 三颗飞星同时静止。 191号文明的人们站在大地上无助地看 着这三颗在正空悬停的飞星，看着向他们的世界直扑过来的三颗太阳。 几天后，一个太阳运行到外层气层的可见距离，宁静夜空中，那颗飞星 突然变幻成光焰四射的太阳，以三十多小时的间隔，另外两个太阳也相 继显形。这不是一般意义上的‘三日凌空’

落，使世界处于长达几世纪的陨石雨中……你能想象那是怎样的地狱 啊！这次灾难对生态圈的破坏是所有历史上最严重的一次，伴星上的 生命已经灭绝，母星也几乎变成一个没有生命的世界，但生命的种子居 然又在这里发芽了，随着母星地质状态的稳定，在面目全非的大陆和海 洋中，进化又开始了蹒跚的脚步，直到文明第一百九十二次出现，这个 过程，耗时九千万年。 “三体世界所处的宇宙，比我们想象的更加冷酷。下一次‘飞星不 动’会怎样？有很大的可能，我们的行星不再从太阳边缘掠过，而是一 头扎进太阳的火海中。随着时间的推移，这种可能几乎是必然。 “这本来只是一个可怕的推测，但最近的一项天文学发现，使我们 对三体世界的命运彻底绝望了。这项研究旨在通过这个星系中的一些 残留的迹象，推测出星系中恒星和行星形成的历史。无意中发现，三体 星系在遥远的时间前曾有过十二颗行星！而现在只剩下我们这一颗，解 释只有一个：在漫长的天文纪年中那十一颗行星均被三颗太阳所吞 噬！我们的世界，只不过是这场宇宙大捕猎的残余，文明能够经过一百 九十二次轮回再生，只不过是一种幸运而已。通过进一步的研究，我们 还发现了这三颗恒星的呼吸现象。 ” “恒星呼吸？” “只是一个比喻，您发现了恒星的外围气态层，但您不知道的是， 这个气态层以漫长的周期不停地膨胀和收缩，像呼吸一样。当气态层膨 胀时，其厚度可以增大十多倍，这使得恒星的直径大大增加，像一个巨 掌，更容易捕获到行星。当一颗行星与太阳近距离擦过时，就会进入它 的气态层，在剧烈的摩擦中急剧减速，最后像一颗流星，拖着长长的火 尾坠入太阳的火海。 据考证， 在三体星系的漫长历史上， 太阳气态层每膨 胀一次，就会吞噬一到两颗行星，那十一颗行星，就是在太阳气态层膨 胀到最大时相继坠入火海的。现在，三颗太阳的气态层都处于收缩状 态，否则在上次擦阳而过时，我们的行星已经坠落到太阳中了。据学者 中国科幻基石丛书 180 们的预测，最近的一次膨胀将在一百五十至二百万年后发生。 ” “这个鬼地方，实在是待不下去了。 ”爱因斯坦用一个老乞丐的姿 势抱着小提琴蹲在地上说。 秘书长点点头说： “待不下去了，也不能再待下去了！三体文明的 唯一出路，就是和这个宇宙赌一把。 ” “怎么赌？”汪淼问。 “飞出三体星系，飞向广阔的星海，在银河系中寻找可以移民的新 世界！ ” 这时汪淼听到一阵“轧轧”的声音，看到巨大的摆锤正在被旁边 一个高架绞车上的一根细缆斜拉着升高，升向它被释放的位置，它后面 的天空背景上，一弯巨大的残月正在晨光中下沉。 秘书长庄严宣布： “单摆启动！ ” 高架绞车松开了将摆锤拉向高处的细缆，巨大的摆锤沿着一条平 滑的弧形轨迹无声地滑落下来，开始落得很慢，但迅速加速，到达最低 点时速度达到最大，冲破空气发出了浑厚的风声，当这声音消失时，摆 锤已沿着同样的弧形轨迹升到了同样的高度，停滞片刻后开始了新一 轮的摆动。汪淼感到摆锤在摆动中仿佛产生了一股巨大的力量，仿佛大 地被它拉得摇摇晃晃。与现实世界中的单摆不同，这个巨摆的摆动周期 不恒定，时刻在变化中，这是因为围绕母星的巨月产生的重力变化所 致：巨月在母星的这一面时，它与母星的引力相互抵消，重力减小；当它 运行到母星另一面时，引力叠加，重力几乎恢复到大撕裂之前。 仰望着三体纪念碑气势磅礴的摆动，汪淼问自己：它是表达对规律 的渴望，还是对混沌的屈服？汪淼又觉得摆锤像一只巨大的金属拳头， 对冷酷的宇宙永恒地挥舞着，无声地发出三体文明不屈的呐喊……当 汪淼的双眼被泪水模糊时，他看到了以巨摆为背景出现的字幕： 四百五十一年后， 192号文明在双日凌空的烈焰中毁灭，它进化到 原子和信息时代。

Miao logged on to Thr ee Body , it was dawn as usual, but the world was unrecognizable. The great pyramid that had appeared the first four times h ad been destroyed by the tri-solar syzyg y . In its place was a tall, mode rn building, whose dark gray shape was familiar to W ang: the United Nations Headquarters. In the distance w ere many more tall buildings, apparently dehyd ratories. All had completely reflective mirror surfaces. In the dawn light they appeared as giant crystal plants growing out of the ground. W ang heard a violin playing something by Mozart. The playing wasn’ t very pra cticed, but there was a special charm to it, as though sa ying: I play for myself . The violinist w as a homeless o ld man sitting on the steps in fro nt of th e UN Head quarters, his fluf fy silver hair fluttering in the wind. Next to his feet was an old top hat containing some scattered change. W ang su ddenly noticed the sun. But it rose in the opposite direction from the dawn l ight, and the pat ch of the sky around it was still completely dark. The sun was v ery lar ge, its h alf-risen disk taking up a third of the horizon. W ang’ s heart beat faste r: Such a lar ge sun could only m ean another great cat astrophe. But when W ang turned around, the old man continued toplay as though n othing odd was happening. His silver hair shon e brilliantly in the sun, as though it was on fire. The sun was silvery , just like the old man’ s hair . It cast a pale white light over the ground, but W ang couldn’ t feel any warmth from the light. He gazed at the sun , which had now completely risen. On the giant silver disk he could pick out lines like wood grains: mountain ranges. W ang re alized that the disk did not emit light. It only reflected the light from the real sun, which was on the other side of the sky , below the horizon. What had risen wasn’ t a sun at all, but a giant moon. The giant moon moved briskly up the sk y at a pace that could be dete cted by the naked ey e. In the process, it gr adually waned from a full to a half moon, and then a crescent. The old m an’ s soothing violin strains drifted on the cold morning breeze. The majestic sight of the universe was like the music made material. W ang was intoxicated. The gian t cresce nt now fell into the dawn light and grew much brighter . When only two glowing tips re mained above the horizon, W ang imagined them as the tips of the horns of a titanic bull rushing toward the sun. “Honored Copernicus, rest your busy feet here a while,” the old man said, after the giant moon had set. “Then after you’ve apprec iated some Mozart, perhaps I can have some lunch.” “If I’m not mistaken…” W ang looked at the face full of wrinkles. The wrinkles were long and their curves gentle, as though they were trying to create a kind of harmony . “Y ou’re not. I’m Einstein, a pitiful man full of faith in God , though abandoned by Him.” “What i s that giant moon? I’ve never seen it the previous times I was here.” “It’ s already cooled of f.” “What?” “The big moon. When I was little it was still hot. When it ros e to the middle of the sk y , I could see the red glow from the central plai ns. But now it’ s cold.… Haven’ t you heard about the great rip?” “No. What’ s that?” Einstein sighed and shook his head. “Let’ s not speak of it. Fo r get the past. My past, civilization’ s past , the universe’ s pastall of it too painful to recall.”“How d id you get to be like th is?” W ang searched in his poc ket and found some change. He bent over and dropped the money into the hat. “Thank you, Mr . Copernicus. Let’ s hope that God doesn’ t abandon you, though I don’ t have much faith in that. I feel that the model you and Newton and the others created in the East with the help of the human- formation comp uter was very c lose to being correct. But the little bit of error left was like an uncrossable chasm for Newton and the others. “I’ve alw ays believed that without me, others would have dis covered special r elativity eventually . Bu t general relativity is dif ferent. The bit that Newton lacked was the ef fect on planetary orbit from the gravitationally induced curvature of space-time described by general relativity . Though the error caused by it was small, its impact on the results of the computation was fata l. Adding the correction factor for perturbation from space-time curvature to the classical equations would yield the right mathematical model. T he amount of computational power required far exceeds what you accomplished in the East, but is easily provided by modern computers.” “Have t he resul ts of the compu tation been confirmed by astronomical observations?” “If that had occurred, do you think I’d be here? But from the perspective of a esthetics, I must be right and the universe must be w rong. God abandoned me, then others abandoned me as well. I’m wanted nowhere. Princeton dismis sed me as a professor . UNESCO wouldn’ t even have me as a science consultant. Before, even if they had begged on their knees, I wouldn’ t have wanted the position. I even thought of going to Israel to be president, but they changed their minds and said I was nothing but a fraud. …” Einstein began playing again, picking up right where he had stopped. After listening to him for a while, W ang strode toward the UN building. “There’ s no one in there,” Einst ein said, still playing. “All the members of t he General Assembly sess ion are behind the building at tending the Pendulum Initiation Ceremony .” W ang w alked around the building and was greeted by a breathtaking sight: a colossal pendulum that seemed to stretch between the sky and the earth. In fact, W ang had seen it peeking out from behind the building, but he didn’ t know what he was seeing.The pendulum resembled those constructed by Fu Xi to hypnotize the sun god during the W arring S tates Period, back when W ang Miao first logged on to Thr ee Body . Bu t the pendulum before him had been completely modernized. The tw o pillars holding up the pendulum were made of metal, each as tall as th e Eif fel T ower . The weight wa s also made of metal, streamlined, with a smooth, mirrorlike, electroplated surface. The pendulum line, made of some ultrastrong material, was so thin as to be almost i nvisible, and the weight seemed to float in the air between the two towers. Below t he pendulum was a crowd of people dressed in suits, p robably the l eaders of th e various countries attending the General Assembly session. They gathered in small cliques and talked amongst themselves quietly , as though waiting for something. “Ah, Copernicus, the man who crossed five eras!” someone shouted. The others welcomed him. “Y ou’re one of those who saw the pendulums of the W arring States Period w ith you r own eyes!” A friendly man shook and held W ang’ s hand. Someone introduced the man as the secretary general of the UN, from Africa. “Y es, I did see th em,” W ang said. “But why are we building ano ther one now?” “It’ s a monument for T risolaris, as well as a tombstone.” The secretary general looked up at the pendulu m. From down here, it appeared as big as a submarine. “A tombstone? For who?” “For an aspiration, a striving t hat lasted through almost two hundred civilizations: the ef fort to solve the three-body problem, to find the pattern in the suns’ movements.” “Is the ef fort over?” “Y es. As of now , it’ s completely over .” W ang hesitated for a moment before taking out a stack of papers, W ei Cheng’ s three-b ody mathematical model. “I … I came here for this. I brought a mathematical model that solves the three-body prob lem. I have reason to believe it will likely work.” As soon as W ang said this, the crowd around him lost intere st. They returned to their cliques to continue their conversations. He no ticed that afew eve n shook their heads an d laughed as they left him. The secretary general took the document and, without even glancing at it, handed it to a slender m an wea ring glasses standing next to him. “Out of respect for your famed r eputation, I’ll have my science advisor take a look. Indeed, everyone here has shown you respect. If anyone else had said what you said, they’d be laughing at him.” The sci ence ad visor flipped through the document. “Evol utionary algorithm? Copernicus, you’re a genius. Anyone who can come up with such an algorithm is a genius. This requires not only superior math skills, but also imagination.” “Y ou se em to be suggesting that someone has already created such a mathematical model?” “Y es. There are dozens of othe r mathematical models. Of those, more than hal f are more advanced than yours. They’ve all been implemented and run on computers. During the pa st two centuries, such massive c omputation became the principal activity of this world. Everyone waited fo r the results as if waiting for Judgment Day .” “And?” “W e have definitively proven that the three-body problem has no solution.” W ang ga zed up at the massive p endulum overhead. In the dawn light, it was crystal bright. Its deformed mirrorlike surface reflected everything around i t like the eye of the world. In this place, in a distant ag e separated from the here an d now by many civilizations, he and King W en had passed through a forest of giant pendulums on their way to the palace of King Zhou. Ju st like that, history ha d made a long circuit and returned to its starting place. The scie nce adv isor said, “It’ s ju st like we guessed long ago: The three- body system is a chaotic system. T iny perturbations can be endlessly amplified. Its patterns of movement essentially cannot be mathematically predicted.” W ang fe lt his scientific knowled ge and system of thought become a blur in a sing le mom ent. In their plac e was unprecedented confusion. “If even an extremely simple arrangement like the three-body system is unpredictable chaos, h ow ca n we have an y faith in discovering the la ws of the complicated universe?”“God is a shameless old gambler . He has abandoned us!” The speaker was Einstein, waving his violin. W ang didn’ t know when he had shown up. The secretary general slowly nodded. “Y es, God is a gambler . The only hope for T risolaran civilization is to gamble as well.” By now , the giant moon was rising again from the dark side of the horizon. Its lar ge, silvery image was reflected by the surface of the pendulum weight. The light wriggled strangely , as though the weight and the moon had developed a mysterious sympathy together . “This civilizatio n seems to have developed to a very advance d state,” W ang said. “Y es. W e’ve mastered the en er gy of the atom and reac hed the Information Age.” The secretary general didn’ t seem to be too impressed by his own words. “Then th ere is hope: Even if it’ s impossible to know the pattern of the suns’ movemen ts, civilization can continue to develop until it reaches a stage where it can survive the Chaotic Eras by protecting itself against the devastating catastrophes of those eras.” “People once thought as you do. That was one of the motivatin g forces pushing T risolaran civilization to tenaciously come back again and again. But the moon made us realize t he naveté of such an idea.” The secretary general pointed to the rising giant moon. “This is probably the first time you’ve s een this moon. Actually , since it’ s about a quarter of the size of our planet, i t’ s no longer a moon, b ut a companion to our world in a double planet system. It resulted from the great rip.” “The great rip?” “The disaster that destroyed t he last civilization. Compared to the civilizations before it, they had ample warning of the disaste r . Based on surviving records, the astronomers of Civilization 191 detected a frozen flying star early on.” W ang’ s heart clenched as he heard the last phrase. A frozen fly ing star was a terrible o men for T risolaris. When a flying star , or a distant sun, seems to come to a complete stop against the background starfield, then the sun’ s and the planet’ s motion v ectors are aligned. This has th ree possible interpretations: t he sun and the planet are moving in the same direction at the same speed; the sun and the planet are moving apart from each other; and the sun and the planet are moving toward each ot her . BeforeCivilization 191 , this last possibility was purely theoretical, a disaster that had never occurred. But the population’ s fear of it and their vigilance did not diminish, so much so that “frozen flying star” became an extremely unlucky phrase in many T risolaran civilizations. A single flying star remaining still was suf ficient to terrify everyone. “And then three flying stars froze simultaneously . The people of Civilization 191 stood on the ground, gazing up helplessly at the three frozen flying stars, at the three suns falling directly toward their world. A few day s later , one of the suns m oved to a distance where its outer gaseous layer be came vi sible. In the mi ddle of a tranquil night, the star suddenly turned into a blazing sun. Separated by intervals of thirty hours or so, the other tw o suns also appeared in quick succession. This was not a normal kind of tri-solar day . By the time the last flying star turned int o a sun, the first sun had already swept past the planet at extremely close range. Right after that, the other two suns swept past T risolaris at even closer ranges, well within the p lanet’ s Roche limit31, suc h th at the tidal forces imposed on T risolaris by the three suns exceeded the force of the planet’ s gravitational self-attraction. The first sun shook the deepest geological structure of the planet; the second sun tore open a great rift in the planet that went straight to the core; and the third sun ripped the planet into two pieces.” The secr etary general pointed at the giant moon overhead. “That’ s the smaller piece. There are still ru ins from Civilization 191 on i t, but it’ s a lifeless world. It was the most terrible disaster in the entire history of T risolaris. After the planet was t orn apart, the two irregularly sh aped pieces each returned to spherical form under self-gravitation. The dense, searing planetary core material gushed to the surface, and the oceans boiled over the lava. The continents drifted over the magma like iceber g s. As they collided, the ground became as soft as the ocean. Massive mountain ranges tens of thousand s of meters high rose in an hour and disappeared just as quickly . “For a while, the two ripped -apart pieces were still connected by streams of molten lava that coalesced into a space-spanning riv er . Then the lava coo led and turned into r ings around the planets, but because of perturbations from the planets, the rings were unstable. The rocks that formed them fell back to the surface in a rain of giant stones that lastedseveral centurie s.… Can you imagine what kind of hell that was? The ecological destru ction caused by this catastrophe was the most severe in all of histor y . All life on the comp anion planet went extinct, and the mother planet a lmost be came a lifeless waste as well. But in the end, the seeds of life man aged to germinate here, and as the geology of the mo ther planet settled d own, ev olution began its tottering steps in new oceans and on new continents, until civilization reappeared for the one hundred and ninety- second time. The entire process took ninety million years. “T risolaris’ s place in the universe is even more grim than we had imagined. What will happen the next time frozen flying stars occur? V ery likely , our planet will not just sk im past the edge of the sun, but will plunge into the fiery se a of the sun itself. Given enough time, this possibility will become certainty . “This was originally just a frightening speculation, but a recent astronomical discovery has caused us to lose all hope for the fate of T risolaris. The researchers had intended to recover the his tory of the formation of the stars and the planets based on signs in this stellar system. Instead, they discovered that, in the distant past, the T risolaran stellar system had twelve planets. Y et, now only this one remains. “There i s only one explanation: The other eleven planets have all been consumed by the three suns! Our world is nothing more than the sole survivor of a Great Hunt. The fact that civilization has been reincarnated a hundred and ninety-two times is only a kind of luck. Also, after further study , we discovered the phenomenon of ‘breathing’ by the three stars.” “The stars breathe?” “It’ s only a metaphor . Y ou dis covered the gaseous outer layer of the suns, but you didn’ t know that this gaseous layer expands an d contracts over cyc les lasting eons, like b reathing. When the gaseous layer expands, its th ickness can grow by more than a dozen times. This great ly increases the d iameter of the sun, like a g iant mitt that can catch planets more easily . When a planet p asses by a sun at close range, it will enter the su n’ s gaseous layer . Friction will cause it to lose speed, and finally , like a me teor , it will fall into the blazing sea of the sun, dragging a long, fiery tail. “The stu dy resu lts show that in the long history of the T risolaran stellar system, every time the suns’ gaseous layers expanded, one or two planets were consumed. The other eleven planets all fell into a fiery sea duringtimes wh en the gaseous layers were at their greatest. Right now , the gaseous layers of the three suns are in a contracted stageotherwise our planet would have already fallen into o ne of them the last time they skimmed past. But sch olars predict that the next expansion will occur in one thousand years.” “W e can’ t stay in this terrible place anymore,” Einstein said, crouched down on the ground like an old beggar . The secretary general nodded. “ W e can’ t stay here any longer . The only path left for T risolaran civilization is to gamble with the universe.” “How?” W ang asked. “W e mu st leave the T risolaran stellar system and fly into the wi de open sea of stars. W e must find in the galaxy a new world to emigrate to.” W ang heard a grinding noise. He saw that the giant weight of the pendulum was being pulled u p by a thin cable whose other end was attached to an elevated winch. A s it rose to its highest point, a great waning crescent moon descended slowly in the sky behind it. The secretary general solemnly announced, “Start the pendulum.” The elevated winch released the cable tied to the pendulum, and the weight noiseless ly fell along a smooth arc. Initially , it fell slowly , but then it accelerated, reac hing maximum speed at the bottom of the arc. As it sliced through the air , the sound of the wind was deep and resonant. By the time the nois e disappeared, the pendulum had followed the arc to its highest point on the other side, and, after pausing for a moment, began i ts backward swing. W ang fe lt the great force generated by the movement of the pendulum, as though the ground was shake n by its swings. Unlike a pendulum in the real world, this giant pendulum’ s period was not stable, but changed constantly . This was due to the continually shifting gravitational attraction of th e gi ant moo n. When the gi ant moon was on this side of th e planet, its gravity partially canceled out the gravity of the planet, causing the pendulum to lose weight. When it was on the other side of the planet, its gravity was added to the grav ity of the planet, causing the pendulum’ s weight t o increa se, almost to the level it would have had before the great rip. As he gazed up at the awe-inspi ring swings of the T risolaran Pe ndulum Monument, W ang asked himself, Does it r epr esent the yearning for or der ,or the surr ender to chaos? W ang also thou ght of the pendulum as a gigantic metal fist, swinging eternally against the unfeeling universe, noiselessly shouting out T risolaran civilization’ s indomitable battle cry .… As W ang Miao’ s eyes blurred with tears, he saw a line of text appear against the background of the swinging pendulum: Four hundr ed and fifty-one years later , Civilization 192 was destroyed by the fiery flames of twin suns appearing together . It had reached the Atomic Age and the Information Age. Civilization 192 was a milestone in T risolaran civilization. It finally proved that the three-body problem had no solution. It ga ve up the useless ef fort that had already lasted through 19 1 cycles and set the course for f uture civilizations. Thus, the goal of Thr ee Body has changed. The new goal is: Head for the stars; find a new home. W e invite you to log on again. * * * After logging out of Thr ee Body , W ang felt exhausted, the same way he did after each previous session. But this time, he only rested half an hour before logging in again. This tim e, again st the pitch-black background, an unexpected line of text appeared: The situati on is ur gent. The Thr ee Body se rvers are about to be shut down. Please log on freely during the remaining time. Thr ee Body will now go directly to the final scene."

”汪淼指指记者和哲学家等人说。言多必失，他 只是简单地答这一句。 “很好。 ”潘寒说着，转向了 IT副总裁和国电公司领导， “你们二 位，已经不适合这场聚会了，也不适合继续玩《三体》游戏。你们的 ID 将被注销，下面请你们离开。谢谢你们的到来，请！ ” 两人站起身来对视一下，又困惑地看看周围，转身走出门去。 潘寒向剩下的五个人伸出手来，挨个与他们紧紧握手。最后庄严地 说： “我们，是同志了。 ” 地球往事 三体 173 20．三体、爱因斯坦、 单摆、 大撕裂 汪淼第五次进入《三体》时，黎明中的世界已面目全非。前四次均 出现的大金字塔已在“三日连珠”中毁灭，在那个位置上出现了一座高 大的现代建筑。这幢黑色大楼的样子汪淼很熟悉，那是联合国大厦。 远处的大地上，星罗棋布着许多显然是干仓的高大建筑，都有着全反射 的镜面表面，在晨光中像大地上生长的巨型水晶植物。 汪淼听见一阵小提琴声，好像是莫扎特的一首曲子，拉得不熟练， 但有一种很特别的韵味，仿佛时时在说明，这是拉给自己听的，而自己 也很欣赏。琴声来自坐在大厦正门台阶上的一位流浪老人，他蓬松的银 发在风中飘着，他脚下放了一顶破礼帽，里面好像已经有人放了些零 钱。 汪淼突然发现日出了，但太阳是从与晨光相反方向的地平线下升 起的，那里的天穹还是一片漆黑的夜空，太阳升起之前没有任何晨光。 太阳很大，升出一半的日轮占据了三分之一的地平线。汪淼的心跳加快 了，这么大的太阳，只能意味着又一次大毁灭。但他回头看时，见那位老 人仍若无其事地坐在那儿拉琴，他的银发在太阳的光芒中像燃烧起来 似的。 这太阳就是银色的，与老人头发一样的颜色，它将一片银光撒向大 地，但汪淼从这光芒中感觉不到一点儿暖意。他看看已经完全升出地平 线的太阳，从那发出银光的巨盘上，他清晰地看到了木纹状的图形，那 是固态的山脉。汪淼明白了，它本身不发光，只是反射从另一个方向发 出晨光的真太阳的光芒，升起来的不是太阳，而是一个巨型月亮！巨月 中国科幻基石丛书 174 运行得很快，以肉眼可以察觉的速度掠过长空，在这个过程中，它逐渐 由满月融缺成半月，然后又变成了月牙，老人舒缓的小提琴声在寒冷的 晨风中飘荡，宇宙中壮丽的景象仿佛就是那音乐的物化，汪淼陶醉于美 的震慑之中。巨大月牙在晨光中落下，这时它的亮度增长了很多，当它 只剩两个银光四射的尖角在地平线之上时，汪淼突然将其想象成一头 正在奔向太阳的宇宙巨牛的两只犄角。 “尊敬的哥白尼，停一停您匆忙的脚步吧，这样您欣赏一曲莫扎 特，我也就有了午饭。 ”巨月完全落下后，老人抬起头来说。 “如果我没认错”汪淼看着那张满是皱纹的脸说，那些皱纹都 很长，曲线也很柔和，像在努力造就一种和谐。 “您没认错，我是爱因斯坦，一个对上帝充满信仰却被他抛弃的可 怜人。 ” “刚才那个大月亮是怎么回事？我前几次来没有见过它。 ” “它已经凉下来了。 ” “谁？” “大月亮啊，我小时候它还热着，升到中天时能看到核心平原上的 红光，现在凉下来了……你没听说过大撕裂吗？” “没有，怎么回事？” 爱因斯坦叹息着摇摇头： “不提了，往事不堪回首，我的过去，文明 的过去，宇宙的过去，都不堪回首啊！ ” “您怎么落到这个地步？”汪淼掏掏口袋，真的掏出了一些零钱，他 弯腰将钱放到帽子里。 “谢谢哥白尼先生，但愿上帝不抛弃您吧，不过我对此没有信心。 我感觉，您和牛顿他们到东方用人列运算的那个模型，已很接近于正确 了，但所差的那么一点点，对牛顿或其他的人来说是一道不可逾越的鸿 沟。我一直认为，没有我，别人也会发现狭义相对论，但广义相对论却不 是这样。牛顿差的那一点，就是广义相对论所描述的行星轨道的引力摄 动，它引起的误差虽然很小，但对计算结果却是致命的。在经典方程中 地球往事 三体 175 加入引力摄动的修正，就得到了正确的数学模型。它的运算量比你们在 东方完成的要大得多，但对现代计算机来说，真的不成问题。 ” “运算结果得到天文观测的证实了吗？” “要那样我会在这里吗？但从美学角度讲，我是没错的，错的是宇 宙。上帝抛弃了我，接着所有的人都抛弃了我，哪里都不要我，普林斯顿 撤销了我的教授职位，联合国教科文组织连个科学顾问的职位都不给 我，以前他们跪着求我我都不干呢；我甚至想去以色列当总统，可他们 说他们改变主意了，说我不过是个骗子，唉 ” 爱因斯坦说完又拉起了琴，很精确地从刚才的中断处拉起。汪淼听 了一会儿，迈步向大厦的大门走去。 “里面没有人，参加这届联大的所有人都在大厦后面参加单摆启动 仪式。 ”爱因斯坦拉着琴说。 汪淼绕过了大厦，来到它后面，立刻看到了一件不可思议的东西： 一架顶天立地的巨型单摆。其实在大厦前面就能看到它露出的一段，但 汪淼当时不知道是什么东西。这就是汪淼第一次进入《三体》时，在战 国时代的大地上看到的由伏羲建造的那种巨摆，用来给太阳神催眠。眼 前这架巨摆外形已经现代化，支撑天桥的两个高塔是全金属结构，每一 个都有埃菲尔铁塔那么高，摆锤也是金属的，呈流线型，表面是光滑的 电镀镜面，由于有了高强度材料，悬吊摆锤的线缆只有很细的一根，几 乎看不到，这使得摆锤看上去像是空悬在两座高塔之间的空中。 在巨摆之下有一群穿着西装的人，可能就是参加联大会议的各国 首脑了。他们三五成堆地低声聊着，好像在等待着什么。 “啊，哥白尼，跨越五个时代的人！ ”有人高声喊道，其他人纷纷对 他表示欢迎。 “而且，您是在那战国时代亲眼见过单摆的人！ ”一个面貌和善的 黑人握着汪淼的手说。有人介绍他是本届联合国秘书长。 “是的，我见过，可为什么现在又建起这东西？”汪淼问。 “它是三体纪念碑，也是一个墓碑。 ”秘书长仰望着半空中的摆锤 中国科幻基石丛书 176 说，从这里看去，它足有一个潜水艇那么大。 “墓碑？谁的？” “一个努力的，一个延续了近二百个文明的努力，为解决三体问题 的努力，寻找太阳运行规律的努力。 ” “这努力终结了吗？” “到现在为止，彻底终结了。 ” 汪淼犹豫了一下，拿出了一叠资料，这是魏成三体问题数学模型的 链接： “我……就是为此事而来的，我带来了一个解决三体问题的数学 模型，据信是很有可能成功。 ” 汪淼话一出口，发现周围的人立刻对他失去了兴趣，都离开他回 到自己的小圈子里继续刚才的聊天，他注意到有的人离开时还笑着摇摇 头。秘书长拿过了资料，看也没看就递给了旁边一位戴眼镜的瘦高的 人： “出于对您崇高威望的尊敬，请我的科学顾问看看吧。其实大家已 经对您表示了这种尊敬，换了别人，会立刻招来嘲笑的。 ” 科学顾问接过资料翻了翻： “进化算法？哥白尼，你是个天才，能搞 出这种算法的人都是天才，这除了高超的数学能力，还需要想象力。 ” “听您的意思，已经有人创造了这种数学模型？” “是的，还有其他几十种数学模型，其中一半以上比您这个要高明 得多，都被创造出来，并在计算机上完成了计算。在过去的两个世纪中， 这种巨量的计算是世界的中心活动，人们就像等待最后审判日那样等着 结果。 ” “结果呢？” “已经确切地证明，三体问题无解。 ” 汪淼仰望着巨大的摆锤，它在晨曦中晶莹光亮，作为一面变形的镜 子反映着周围的一切，仿佛是世界的眸子。在那已被许多个文明所隔开 的遥远时代，就在这片大地上，他和周文王曾穿过林立的巨摆走向纣王 的宫殿。历史就这样划了一个漫长的大圈，回到了最初的地方。 “正像我们早就猜测的那样，三体是一个混沌系统，会将微小的扰 地球往事 三体 177 动无限放大，其运行规律从数学本质上讲是不可预测的。 ”科学顾问 说。 汪淼感觉自己所有的科学知识和思想体系在一瞬间模糊不清了， 代之以前所未有的迷茫： “如果连三体这样极其简单的系统都处于不 可预知的混沌，那我们还怎样对探索复杂宇宙的规律抱有信心呢？” “上帝是个无耻的老赌徒，他抛弃了我们！ ”爱因斯坦不知什么时 候过来了，挥着小提琴说。 秘书长缓缓地点点头： “是的，上帝是个赌徒，那三体文明的唯一 希望，就是也赌一把了。 ” 这时，巨月又从黑夜一方的天边升起，它银色的巨像映在摆锤光滑 表面上，光怪陆离地蠕动着，仿佛摆锤和巨月两者之间产生了神秘的 心灵感应。 “您说到文明，这一个文明好像已经发展到相当的高度了。 ”汪淼 说。 “是的，掌握了核能，到了信息时代。 ”秘书长说，但对这一切似乎 不以为然。 “那就存在着这样一个希望：文明继续发展下去，达到另一个高 度，虽然不能得知太阳运行的规律，但能够在乱纪元生存下去，并且能 够抵御以前太阳异常运行造成的那些毁灭性的大灾难。 ” “以前人们都是这样想的，这也是三体文明前赴后继顽强再生的 动力之一，但它使我们认识到，这一想法是何等的天真。 ”秘书长指指 正在升起的巨月说， “你可能是第一次看到这个巨大的月亮，其实它几 乎有我们行星的四分之一大小，已经不是一个月亮，而是这颗行星的一 颗伴星了，它是大撕裂的产物。 ” “大撕裂？” “毁灭上一轮文明的大灾难。其实，与以前的文明相比，对这个灾 难的预警期还是相当长的。遗留的记载显示， 191号文明的天文学家 很早就观测到了‘飞星不动’ 。 ” 中国科幻基石丛书 178 听到最后四个字，汪淼心里一紧。 “飞星不动”是三体世界最大的 凶兆，飞星，或者说远方的太阳，从地面的观察角度看在宇宙的背景上 静止了，只意味太阳与行星在一条直线上运行。这有三种可能：一、 太阳与行星以相同的速度向同一方向运行；二、太阳正远离行星而去； 三、太阳正冲向行星而来。在 191号文明之前，这只是一种想象中的灾 难，从未真实发生过，但人们对它的恐惧和警觉丝毫没有放松，以至于 “飞星不动”成了多个三体文明中的一句最不吉利的咒语。即使只有一 颗飞星静止，也让人不寒而栗。 “当时， 三颗飞星同时静止。 191号文明的人们站在大地上无助地看 着这三颗在正空悬停的飞星，看着向他们的世界直扑过来的三颗太阳。 几天后，一个太阳运行到外层气层的可见距离，宁静夜空中，那颗飞星 突然变幻成光焰四射的太阳，以三十多小时的间隔，另外两个太阳也相 继显形。这不是一般意义上的‘三日凌空’ ，当最后一颗飞星变成太阳 时，第一颗显形的太阳已从极近的距离掠过行星，紧接着，另外两个太 阳相继从更近处掠过！三个太阳对行星产生的潮汐力均超过洛希极 限 ① ，第一颗太阳撼动了行星最深层的地质结构，第二颗太阳在行星上 撕开了直通地核的大裂缝，第三颗太阳将行星撕成了两半。 ” 秘书长指着已升到正空的巨月， “这就是较小的一半，上面有 191 号文明留下的废墟，但已是一个没有生命的世界。那是三体世界全部历 史上最为惊心动魄的灾难，当行星被撕裂后，形状不规则的两部分在自 身引力下重新变成球形，灼热致密的行星核心物质涌上地面，海洋在岩 浆上沸腾，大陆如消融的流冰般漂浮，它们相撞后，大地变得像海洋般 柔软，几万米的巨大山脉可以在一个小时内升起，又在同样短的时间内 消失。在一段时间内，行星被撕开的两部分藕断丝连，它们之间有一条 横穿太空的岩浆的河流，这些岩浆在太空中冷却，在行星周围形成了一 ①法国天文学家洛希证明，任何坚固的天体，在接近另一个比它大得多的天体的时 候，都会受到强大的潮汐力作用而最终被扯成碎片。这个较小的天体会被拉碎的距离称 为洛希极限，通常是大天体赤道半径的 2.44倍。 地球往事 三体 179 个环，但由于行星两部分的引力扰动，环不稳定，构成它的岩石纷纷坠 落，使世界处于长达几世纪的陨石雨中……你能想象那是怎样的地狱 啊！这次灾难对生态圈的破坏是所有历史上最严重的一次，伴星上的 生命已经灭绝，母星也几乎变成一个没有生命的世界，但生命的种子居 然又在这里发芽了，随着母星地质状态的稳定，在面目全非的大陆和海 洋中，进化又开始了蹒跚的脚步，直到文明第一百九十二次出现，这个 过程，耗时九千万年。 “三体世界所处的宇宙，比我们想象的更加冷酷。下一次‘飞星不 动’会怎样？有很大的可能，我们的行星不再从太阳边缘掠过，而是一 头扎进太阳的火海中。随着时间的推移，这种可能几乎是必然。 “这本来只是一个可怕的推测，但最近的一项天文学发现，使我们 对三体世界的命运彻底绝望了。这项研究旨在通过这个星系中的一些 残留的迹象，推测出星系中恒星和行星形成的历史。无意中发现，三体 星系在遥远的时间前曾有过十二颗行星！而现在只剩下我们这一颗，解 释只有一个：在漫长的天文纪年中那十一颗行星均被三颗太阳所吞 噬！我们的世界，只不过是这场宇宙大捕猎的残余，文明能够经过一百 九十二次轮回再生，只不过是一种幸运而已。通过进一步的研究，我们 还发现了这三颗恒星的呼吸现象。 ” “恒星呼吸？” “只是一个比喻，您发现了恒星的外围气态层，但您不知道的是， 这个气态层以漫长的周期不停地膨胀和收缩，像呼吸一样。当气态层膨 胀时，其厚度可以增大十多倍，这使得恒星的直径大大增加，像一个巨 掌，更容易捕获到行星。当一颗行星与太阳近距离擦过时，就会进入它 的气态层，在剧烈的摩擦中急剧减速，最后像一颗流星，拖着长长的火 尾坠入太阳的火海。 据考证， 在三体星系的漫长历史上， 太阳气态层每膨 胀一次，就会吞噬一到两颗行星，那十一颗行星，就是在太阳气态层膨 胀到最大时相继坠入火海的。现在，三颗太阳的气态层都处于收缩状 态，否则在上次擦阳而过时，我们的行星已经坠落到太阳中了。据学者 中国科幻基石丛书 180 们的预测，最近的一次膨胀将在一百五十至二百万年后发生。 ” “这个鬼地方，实在是待不下去了。 ”爱因斯坦用一个老乞丐的姿 势抱着小提琴蹲在地上说。 秘书长点点头说： “待不下去了，也不能再待下去了！三体文明的 唯一出路，就是和这个宇宙赌一把。 ” “怎么赌？”汪淼问。 “飞出三体星系，飞向广阔的星海，在银河系中寻找可以移民的新 世界！ ” 这时汪淼听到一阵“轧轧”的声音，看到巨大的摆锤正在被旁边 一个高架绞车上的一根细缆斜拉着升高，升向它被释放的位置，它后面 的天空背景上，一弯巨大的残月正在晨光中下沉。 秘书长庄严宣布： “单摆启动！ ” 高架绞车松开了将摆锤拉向高处的细缆，巨大的摆锤沿着一条平 滑的弧形轨迹无声地滑落下来，开始落得很慢，但迅速加速，到达最低 点时速度达到最大，冲破空气发出了浑厚的风声，当这声音消失时，摆 锤已沿着同样的弧形轨迹升到了同样的高度，停滞片刻后开始了新一 轮的摆动。汪淼感到摆锤在摆动中仿佛产生了一股巨大的力量，仿佛大 地被它拉得摇摇晃晃。与现实世界中的单摆不同，这个巨摆的摆动周期 不恒定，时刻在变化中，这是因为围绕母星的巨月产生的重力变化所 致：巨月在母星的这一面时，它与母星的引力相互抵消，重力减小；当它 运行到母星另一面时，引力叠加，重力几乎恢复到大撕裂之前。 仰望着三体纪念碑气势磅礴的摆动，汪淼问自己：它是表达对规律 的渴望，还是对混沌的屈服？汪淼又觉得摆锤像一只巨大的金属拳头， 对冷酷的宇宙永恒地挥舞着，无声地发出三体文明不屈的呐喊……当 汪淼的双眼被泪水模糊时，他看到了以巨摆为背景出现的字幕： 四百五十一年后， 192号文明在双日凌空的烈焰中毁灭，它进化到 原子和信息时代。 192号文明是三体文明的里程碑，它最终证明了三体问题的不可 地球往事 三体 181 解，放弃了已延续 191轮文明的徒劳努力，确定了今后文明全新的走 向。至此， 《三体》游戏的最终目标发生变化，新的目标是： 飞向宇宙，寻找新的家园。 欢迎再次登录。 退出《三体》后，汪淼像每次那样感到十分疲惫，这真是一个累人 的游戏，但这次他只休息了半个小时便再次登录。进入《三体》后， 在漆 黑的背景上，出现了一条意想不到的信息： 情况紧急， 《三体》服务器即将关闭，剩余时间自由登录， 《三体》 将直接转换至最后场景。 中国科幻基石丛书 182 21．三体、 远征 寒冷黎明中的大地上空荡荡的一无所有。没有金字塔，没有联合国 大厦，巨摆纪念碑也不知去向，只有黑乎乎的戈壁滩延伸到天际，与 他第一次进入这个世界时一样。但汪淼很快发现这只是自己的错觉，那戈 壁滩上密密麻麻的小石块，竟都是人头！原来大地上站满了人。汪淼站 在一个稍高些的小丘上向下看，这密密的人海一望无际，汪淼大致估计 了一下数量，仅目力所及的范围就可能有几亿人！他知道，三体世界的 所有人可能都聚集在这里了。寂静笼罩着一切，这几亿人造就的寂静有 一种令人窒息的诡异，这黎明中的人海正在等待什么。汪淼看看附近， 发现所有的人都在仰望着天空。 汪淼抬头望去，发现星空发生了不可思议的变化：群星竟然排成了 一个严整的正方形阵列！但汪淼很快发现，这一片排成正方形的星星可 能只是位于行星同步轨道上，银河系的星海成了后面一个暗淡的背景， 这个正方形相对于背景有明显的运行。正方形阵列中，靠晨光一侧的星 体亮度最高，发出的银光能在地面上投出人影，向后面亮度逐渐减弱。 汪淼数了数，阵列的一边上有三十多颗星体，那么阵列中的星体，总数是 一千左右。这显然是由人造物构成的阵列成一个整体在群星的背景上 缓缓移动，看上去充满了庄严的力量感。 这时，站在旁边的一个男人轻轻推了推他，低声说： “啊，伟大的哥 白尼，你怎么来得这样晚？整整过去了三轮文明，你错过了多么伟大的 事业啊！ ” “那是什么？”汪淼指指太空中的星体阵列问。 地球往事 三体 183 “那是伟大的三体星际舰队，马上就要起航远征了。 ” “这么说，三体文明已经具备了星际远航的能力？” “是的，那些宏伟的飞船都能达到十分之一光速。 ” “达到十分之一的光速，至少在我的知识范围内是一个伟大的成 就，但对于星际航行来说，还是慢了些。 ” “千里之行始于足下， ”那人说， “关键是要找对目标。 ” “舰队的目的地是哪里呢？” “四光年外的一颗带有行星的恒星，那是距三体世界最近的恒星。 ” 汪淼有些惊奇： “距我们最近的恒星也是四光年。 ” “你们？” “地球。 ” “哦，这没有什么可奇怪的，在银河系的大片区域，恒星的密度十 分均匀，这是星群引力漫长调节的结果。占相当大比例的恒星，之间的 间距就是在三到六光年之间。 ” 这时，巨大的欢呼声从人海中爆发。汪淼抬头一看，太空中正方形 星阵中，每颗星体的亮度都在急剧增加，这显然是它们本身在发出光 来。这光芒很快淹没了天边的晨曦，一千颗星体很快变成了一千颗小太 阳，三体世界迎来了辉煌的白昼。大地上的人们向着天空都高举双手， 形成了一望无际的手臂的草原。三体舰队开始加速，庄严地移过苍穹， 掠过刚刚升起的巨月顶端，在月面的山脉和平原上投下蔚蓝色的光晕。 欢呼声平息了，三体世界的人们默默地看着他们的希望在西方的太空 渐渐远去，他们此生看不到结局，但四五百年后，他们的子孙将得到来 自新世界的消息，那将是三体文明的新生。汪淼与他们一起默默地遥望 着，直到一千颗星星的方阵缩成一颗星，直到这颗星消失在西方的夜空 中。字幕出现： 三体文明对新世界的远征开始了，舰队正在航程中…… 《三体》游戏结束了，当您回到现实时，如果忠于自己曾做出的承 诺，请按随后发给您的电子邮件中的地址，参加地球三体组织的聚会。,"2 0 T h r e e B o d y : E x p e d i t i o n The chi lly dawn revealed a ba re landscape. There was no pyramid, no United Nations Headquarters, no sign of the Pendulum Monument. Only a dark desert extended to the horizon, just as W ang had seen the first time he had logged in. But W ang soon realized that he was wrong. What he thoug ht were numerous stones arrayed across the desert were not stones at all , but human heads. The ground was filled with a densely packed crowd. From where he stood on a small hill, W ang could see no end to the sea of people. He estimated the number of individuals within his view alone to be i n the hund reds of millions. All the T risolarans on the planet were probably gathered here. The silence of hundreds of m illions created a suf focating sense of strangeness. What ar e they waiting for? W a ng looked a round and noticed everyone was gazing up at the sky . W ang lifted his face and found the starry sky had been transformed to an astonishing sight: The stars were arrayed in a square formation! However , W ang so on real ized that the sta rs in the formation were in a s ynchronous orbit ab ove the planet, moving together against the dimmer , more distant background of the Milky W ay . The stars in the formation close st to the direction of dawn were also the brightest, shining with a silver light that cast shadows on the ground. The brightness decre ased as one moved away from that edge. W a ng countedmore than thirty stars along each edge of the formation, which meant a total of more than a thousand stars. The slow movement of the obviously artificial formation against the starry universe exuded a solemn power . A m an standing next to him n udged him lightly and spoke in a low voice, “Ah, Great Copernicus, why have you come so late? Three cycles of civilizations have passed, and you’ve missed many great enterprises.” “What is that?” W ang asked, pointing at the formation in the sky . “The T risolaran Interstellar Fleet. It’ s about to begin its expedition.” “T risolaran civilization has already achieved the capacity for interstellar flight?” “Y es. All those magnificent sh ips can reach one-tenth the s peed of light.” “That is a great accomplishment, as far as I understand it, bu t it still seems too slow for interstellar flight.” “The journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. The key is finding the right tar get.” “What’ s the fleet’ s destination?” “A s tar with pla nets about four light-years awaythe closest st ar to the T risolaran system.” W ang was surprised. “The closest star to us is also about four light-years away .” “Y ou?” “The Earth.” “Oh, tha t’ s not very surprising. In most regions of the Milky W ay , the distribution of stars is fairly even. It’ s the result of star clusters acting under the influ ence of gravity . The distance between most stars is between three and six light-years.” A loud, joyous cry erupted from the crowd. W ang looked up and saw that every star i n the square formation was rapidly growing br ighter . This was due to the light emitted by the ships themselves. Thei r combined illumination soo n overwhelmed the dawn, and one thousand stars became one thou sand little suns. T risolaris was bathed in glorious dayli ght, and the crowd raised their hands and formed an endless prairie of uplifted arms. The T risolaran Fleet began to accelerate, solemnly gliding across the dome of the sky , skimming past the giant, just-risen moon’ s tip, casting a dim blue glow against the moon’ s mountains and plains.The joyous cry s ubsided. The people of T risolaris mutely gazed as their hope gr adually shrunk in the western sky . They would no t know the outcome of the l aunch in their lifetimes, but four or five hundred years from now , their descendants would receive the news from a new world, the beginning of a n ew life for T risolaran civilization. W ang stood with them, silently gazing, until the phalanx of a thousand stars shrank into a single star , and until that star disappeared in the western night sky . Then the following text appeared: The T risolaran Expedition to the new world has begun. The fleet is still in flight.… Thr ee Body is over . When you have returned to the real world, if you remain true to the promise you’ve made, please attend the meet-up of the Earth-T risolaris Or ganization. The address will be in the follow-up e-mail you receive."
中国科幻基石丛书 184 22．地球叛军 与上次网友聚会相反，这是一次人数众多的聚会，聚会的地点是一 座化工厂的职工食堂。工厂已经搬迁，这栋即将拆除的建筑内部很破 旧，但十分宽敞。聚集在这里的有三百多人，汪淼发现有许多熟悉的面 孔，都是社会名流和各个领域的精英，有著名的科学家、文学家、政治家 等。 首先吸引汪淼注意的是摆放在大厅正中的一个神奇的东西，那是 三个银色的球体，每个直径比保龄球略小，在一个金属基座上空翻飞， 汪淼猜测这个装置可能是基于磁悬浮原理。那三个球体的运动轨道完 全随机，汪淼亲眼看到了真正的三体运动。 其他的人并没有过多地注意那个表现三体运动的艺术品，他们的 注意力集中在大厅中央的潘寒身上，他正站在一张破饭桌上。 “是不是你杀了申玉菲同志？”有人质问道。 “是我。 ”潘寒镇静地说， “组织走到今天这样危险的境地，都是因 为降临派内部有像她这样的叛徒的出卖。 ” “谁给你权力杀人的？ ” “我这是出于对组织的责任心！ ” “你还有责任心？你这人本来就心术不正！ ” “你把话说清楚！ ” “你领导的环境分支都干了些什么，你们的责任是利用和制造环 境问题，以激起人们对科学和现代工业的厌恶。可你呢？凭借主的技术 和预测，为自己捞取名利！ ” 地球往事 三体 185 “我出名是为了自己吗？整个人类在我的眼中已是一堆垃圾，我还 在乎名誉？但我不出名行吗？不出名我如何引导人们的思想？ ” “你尽选择容易的而避开难的！你那些工作，完全可以由社会上那 些环保人士去做！他们比你真诚得多，也热情得多，只要稍加引导，他们 的行为就可以为我们所用。你的环境分支要做的是制造环境灾难，然后 加以利用。 向水库播撒剧毒物质， 在化工厂制造泄漏……这些工作你们 做了吗？一样都没有！ ” “我们有过大量的方案和计划，但都被统帅否决了。至少在以前， 这样做很蠢，生物和医疗分支曾制造过滥用抗菌素灾难，不是很快被识 破了吗？欧洲分队差点引火烧身！ ” “你杀了人，现在已经引火烧身了！ ” “听我说，同志们，迟早都一样！你们肯定已经知道了，各国政府都 已相继进入战争状态，在欧洲和北美，对三体组织的大搜捕已经开始。 我们这里一旦事发，拯救派肯定会倒戈到政府一边，所以我们现在首先 要做的，就是把拯救派从组织中清除出去！ ” “这不是该你考虑的事情。 ” “当然要由统帅考虑，但同志们，我可以负责任地告诉你们，统帅 是降临派！ ” “你这就信口开河了吧，统帅的威信大家都清楚，如果像你说的那 样，拯救派早就被清除出去了！ ” “也许统帅有自己的考虑，说不定今天的会议就是为了这个。 ” 这以后，人们的注意力从潘寒身上移开，转移到目前的危机上来。 一位获得过图灵奖的著名专家跳上桌子，振臂一挥说： “大家说，我们现在到底该怎么办？ ” “全球起义！ ” “这不是自取灭亡吗？ ” “三体精神万岁！我们是顽强的种子，野火烧不尽的！ ” “起义能够在世界政治舞台上表明我们的存在，这将标志着地球 中国科幻基石丛书 186 三体组织第一次公开登上人类历史的舞台，只要纲领合适，会在世界上 引起广泛响应的！ ” 最后这句话是潘寒说的，引起了一些共鸣。 有人喊： “统帅来了！ ”人群让开了一条路，汪淼抬眼望去，感到一 阵眩晕，世界在他的眼中变成了黑白两色，唯一拥有色彩的是刚刚出现 的那个人。 在一群年轻护卫的跟随下，地球三体叛军的最高统帅叶文洁稳步 走来。 叶文洁走到为她空出的一圈空地中央，举起一只瘦削的拳头，用汪 淼不敢想象是出自于她的力量和坚定说： “消灭人类暴政！ ” 这群人类叛徒齐声喊出了显然已无数次重复的呼号： “世界属于 三体！ ” “同志们好。 ”叶文洁说，她的声音又恢复了汪淼熟悉的温软和缓 慢，以至于他这时才最后确定的确是她， “最近身体不太好，没有和大 家见面，现在形势严峻，我知道大家都承受着很大的压力，所以来看 看。” “统帅保重……”人们纷纷说，汪淼听得出，这声音是真诚的。 叶文洁说： “在讨论重大问题之前，我们先处理一件小事。潘 寒”她招呼时眼睛却看着众人。 “统帅，我在这里。 ”潘寒从人群中走出来，这之前他试图躲进人群 深处， 他表面镇静， 但内心的恐惧很容易看出来：统帅没称他同志， 这是 个不祥之兆。 “你严重违反了组织纪律。 ” 叶文洁说话时仍然没看潘寒， 她的声 音仍很柔和，像是面对一个做错了事的孩子。 “统帅，现在组织面临灭顶之灾，如果不采取果断措施，清除我们 内部的异己和敌人，我们将失去一切！ ” 叶文洁抬头看着潘寒，目光温和，却令他的呼吸停止了几秒钟。 “地球三体组织的最终理想和目标，就是失去一切，失去包括我们在内 地球往事 三体 187 的人类现在的一切。 ” “那您就是降临派了！统帅，请您明确宣布这点，这对我们很重要， 是吗，同志们？很重要！ ！”他大声喊道，举起一只手臂四下看看，所有的 人都沉默着，没人响应他。 “这个要求不该由你来提。你严重违反了组织纪律，如果要申诉， 现在可以；否则，你将为此承担责任。 ”叶文洁说得很慢，一个字一个字 地说，像怕她教育的孩子听不懂似的。 “我是去除掉那个数学天才的，这是伊文斯同志做出的决定，在会 议上全体通过。如果那个天才真的搞出了三体运动完整的数学模型，主 就不会降临，地球三体事业将毁于一旦。我当时只是自卫，是申玉菲先 开的枪。 ” 叶文洁点点头说： “就让我们相信你吧， 这毕竟不是目前最重要的 事情，希望我们下面能一直相信你。请你重复一下刚才对我的要求。 ” 潘寒愣了一下， 过了这一关似乎并没有让他松一口气： “我……请 您明确宣布自己属于降临派，毕竟，降临派的纲领也是您的理想。 ” “那你重复一遍这个纲领。 ” “人类社会已经不可能依靠自身的力量解决自己的问题，也不可 能凭借自身的力量抑制自己的疯狂；所以，应该请主降临世界，借助它 的力量，对人类社会进行强制性的监督和改造，以创造一个全新的、光 明完善的人类文明。 ” “降临派忠于这个纲领吗？ ” “当然！请统帅不要轻信谣传。 ” “这不是谣传！ ”一个欧洲人大声说，同时挤到前面来， “我叫拉菲 尔，以色列人。三年前，我十四岁的儿子遇到了车祸，我把孩子的肾捐给 了一个患尿毒症的巴勒斯坦女孩，以此表达我对两个民族和平相处的 愿望，为了这个愿望，我甚至可以献出自己的生命，而许许多多的以色 列人和巴勒斯坦人也在做着和我一样的真诚努力。但这一切都没有用， 我们的家园仍在冤冤相报的泥潭中越陷越深。这使我对人类失去了信 中国科幻基石丛书 188 心，加入了三体组织。绝望使我由一个和平主义者变为极端分子，同时， 可能也是由于我对组织巨额的捐助，让我得以进入降临派的核心。现在 我告诉你们，降临派有自己的秘密纲领，它就是：人类是一个邪恶的物 种，人类文明已经对地球犯下了滔天罪行，必须为此受到惩罚。降临派 的最终目标就是请主来执行这个神圣的惩罚：毁灭全人类！ ” “降临派的真正纲领已是公开的秘密！ ”有人喊道。 “可你们所不知道的是，这并不是由最初的纲领演变而来，而是降 临派诞生时就确定的目标，是伊文斯的终生理想！他欺骗了组织，欺骗 了包括统帅在内的所有人！伊文斯一开始就是朝着这个目标前进的，是 他把降临派变成一个由极端环保主义者和憎恨人类的狂人构成的恐怖 王国！ ” “我也是后来才知道伊文斯的真实想法， ”叶文洁说， “尽管如此， 我还是试图弥合裂痕，使地球三体组织成为一个整体，但降临派做出的 另一些事情使这种努力成为不可能。 ” 潘寒说： “统帅，降临派是地球三体组织的核心力量，没有我们，就 没有地球三体运动！ ” “但这并不是你们垄断组织与主通讯的理由！ ” “第二红岸基地是我们建立的，当然应该由我们运行！ ” “降临派正是借助这个条件，做出了对组织不可饶恕的背叛：你们 截留了主发给组织的信息，你们向组织传达的，只是收到的信息中极少 的一部分，而且经过篡改；你们还通过第二红岸基地，向主发送了大量 未经组织审核的信息。 ” 沉默降临了会场，像一个很重的巨物使汪淼头皮发紧。潘寒没有回 答，他的表情冷漠下来，仿佛在说：好啊，总算发生了。 “对降临派的背叛，有大量的证据，申玉菲同志就是提供者之一， 她曾位居降临派的核心，但她在内心深处，却是一名坚定的拯救派，你 们也是后来才发现这点的。她知道得太多了，这次伊文斯派你去，是要 杀两个人而不是一个。 ” 地球往事 三体 189 潘寒四下看看，显然在快速估量着形势，他的动作被叶文洁注意到 了。 “你可以看到，这次与会的大多是拯救派的同志，少数降临派的成 员，相信他们是会站到组织一边的，但像伊文斯和你这样的人已不可挽 救。为了维护地球三体组织的纲领和理想，我们将彻底解决降临派的问 题。 ” 沉默再次降临。 两三分钟后，叶文洁护卫中的一员，一名苗条美丽的少女动人地笑 了笑，那笑容是那么醒目，将很多人的目光引向了她。少女袅袅婷婷地 向潘寒走去。 潘寒脸色骤变，一手伸进胸前的外衣里，但那少女闪电般冲过来， 旁人还没明白怎么回事，她已经用一条看上去如春藤般柔软的玉臂夹 住了潘寒的脖颈，另一只手放在他的头顶上，以她不可能具有的力量和 极其精巧的受力角度，熟练地将潘寒的头颅扭转了一百八十度，寂静中 颈椎折断的咔嚓声清晰可闻。少女两手同时快速松开，好像那个头颅发 烫似的。潘寒倒在地上，那枝杀死了申玉菲的手枪滑到了桌子下面。他 的躯体仍在抽搐，双眼暴出舌头吐了好长，但头颅却一动不动。仿佛从 来就没有属于过那个躯体。几个人把他拖了出去，他口中吐出的血在地 上拖了长长的一道。 “啊，小汪也来了，你好。 ”叶文洁的目光落到了汪淼身上，向他亲 切地微笑着点点头，然后对其他人说， “这是国家科学院院士汪淼教 授，我的朋友，他研究纳米材料，这是主首先要在地球扑灭的技术。 ” 没有人看汪淼一眼，汪淼也没有力量做任何表示，他不由一手拉住 旁边人的衣袖，使自己站稳，但那人将他的手轻轻拨开了。 叶文洁说： “小汪啊，接着上一次，我给你继续讲红岸的故事吧，同 志们也听听，这不是浪费时间，在这个非常时刻，我们需要回顾一下组 织的历程。 ” “红岸……还没讲完？”汪淼呆呆地问。 中国科幻基石丛书 190 叶文洁缓步走到三体模型前，入神地看着翻飞的银球，夕阳透过破 窗正照在模型上，飞舞的球体将光芒不规则地投射到叛军统帅的身上， 像是火焰。 “没完，才刚刚开始。 ”叶文洁轻轻地说。,"P AR T III S U N S E T F O R H U M A N I T Y2 1 R e b e l s o f E a r t h There were many more attend ees this time than at the last T hree Body meet-up. They met at the employee cafeteria of a chemical plant. The factory had already been moved elsewhere, and the interior of the building, which w as abou t to be demolish ed, was worn out but spacious. About three hundred people were gathered here, and W ang Miao noticed many familiar faces: celebritie s and elites of various fields; famous scientists, writers, politicians, and so on. The firs t thing to attract W ang’ s attention was the strange device at the center o f the cafeteria. Three s ilver spheres, each slightly smaller than a bowling ball, hovered and swirled over a metal base. W ang guessed the device was probably based on m agnetic levitation. The orbits of the three spheres were completely rando m: a real-life version of the three-body problem. The othe rs didn ’ t pay much mi nd to the artistic portrayal of the three- body problem. Instead, they focused on Pan Han, who was standing on top of a broken table in the middle of the cafeteria. “Did you murder comrade Shen Y ufei?” a man asked. “Y es,” Pan said, perfectly cal m. “It’ s because the Adventists have traitors like her in our midst th at the Or ganization faces the crisis it does today .” “Who gave you the right to kill?” “I did it out of a sense of duty to the Or ganization.”“Duty? I think you’ve always had malice in your heart!” “What do you mean by that?” “What has the E nvironment Branch done under your leadershi p? Y our char ge is to exploit and crea te environmental problems to make the population loathe science and modern industry . But in reality , you’ve only used ou r Lord’ s technology and predictions to gain riches an d fame for yourself!” “Do you think I became famous for myself? T o my eyes, th e entire human race is a pile of garbage. Why would I care what they t hink? But if I’m not famous, how do I direct and channel their thinking?” “Y ou alw ays pick the easy tasks. What you’ve done could have been better accomplished by regular environmentalists. They’re more sincere and passionate than you, and with just a little guidance, we could easily take advantage of their actions. Y our Environment Branch should be creating environmental disasters and then exploiting them. For example, disseminating poison in reservoirs, leaking toxic waste from chemical plants … have you done any of those? No, not a single one!” “W e had devised numerous programs and plans, but the commander vetoed t hem all. Anyway , such acts would have been stupid, at least until recently . The Biology and Medicine Branch once created a catastrophe from the o veruse of a ntibiotics, but that was soon detected. And the rash actions of the European Detachment almost drew attention to us.” “T alk about drawing attention to usyou just murdered someone!” “Listen to me, comrades! So oner or later , it would hav e been unavoidable. Y o u must already k now that the governments of th e world are preparing for war . In Europe an d North America, they’re already cracking down on the Or ganization. Once the crackdown begins here, the Redemptionists will no doubt side with the government. So our first priority is to pur ge the Redemptionists from the Or ganization.” “That is not within your authority .” “Of course the commander mus t decide. But, comrades, I can tell you right now that the commander is an Adventist!” “Now you’re just making thing s up. Everyone knows the scope of the commander ’ s p ower . If the commander really is an Adventist, then the Redemptionists would have been pur ged long ago.”“Maybe the commander knows something we don’ t. Perhaps tha t’ s what the meeting today is about.” After thi s, the crowd’ s attention turned away from Pan Han to t he crisis before t hem. A famous scientist who had won the T uring A ward jumped onto the table and began to spe ak. “The time for talk is over . Comrades, what should be our next step?” “Start a global rebellion!” “Then we’re asking to be killed.” “Long li ve the spirit of T risolaris! W e shall persevere like the stubborn grass that resprouts after every wildfire!” “A rebellion will finally reveal our existence to the world. As long as we h ave an app ropriate plan of action, I’m sure many people will support us.” This last remark came from Pan Han, and many applauded. Someone yelled, “The command er is here!” The crowd parted to form a path. W ang looked up and felt dizzy . The world turned white and bla ck in his eyes, and the only spot of color was the person who had just appeared. Surrounded by a group of young bodyguards, the commander in chief of the Earth-T risolaris rebels, Y e W enjie, walked steadily into the crowd. Y e stood in the middle of the s pace the crowd cleared for her , raised a bony fis t, and with a resolve a nd strength that W ang could not believe she possessedsaid, “Eliminate human tyranny!” The crowd responded in a way t hat had clearly been rehearsed c ountless times: “The world belongs to T risolaris!” “Hello, comrade s,” Y e said. Her voice returned to the gentlen ess that W ang knew . It was only now that he could be sure that it was really her . “I haven’ t been well lately , and haven’ t spent much time with all of you. But now the situation is ur gent, and I know everyone is under a great deal of pressure, so I’ve come to see you.” “Commander , take care of yourself,” someone in the crowd said. W ang could hear the heartfelt concern. Y e s aid, “Before we move on to more important matters, let’ s t ake care of one small detail. Pan Han” She kept her eyes on the crowd even as she called his name.“Here, C ommander .” Pan emer g ed from the crowd. Earlier , he had tried to lose himself in the throng. H e appeared calm, but the terror in his heart was obvious. The commander had not called him comrade, a bad sign. “Y ou co mmitted a severe violation of the Or ganization’ s rules.” Y e spoke without looking at Pan. Her voice remained kind, as though talking to a child who had been naughty . “Commander , the Or ganization is facing a crisis of survival! If w e don’ t take decisive measures and clea nse the traitors and enemies wit hin, we will lose everything!” Y e looke d up at Pan, her eyes a f fectionate. But his breath stopped for a few seconds. “The ultimate goal and ideal of the ET O is t o lose everything. Everything that now belongs to the human race, including us.” “Then y ou mus t be an Advent ist! Commander , please openly declare this to be true, because it’ s very important. Am I right, comrades? V ery important!” he shouted, and waved an arm as he looked around. But the crowd remained mute. “This re quest is not yours to ma ke. Y ou have seriously violated our code of co nduct. If you want to make an appeal, now is the time. Otherwise, you must bear the responsibility .” Y e spoke slowly , enunciating every word, as though afraid the child she was teaching had trouble understanding. “I went intending to eliminate W ei Cheng, that math prodigy . The decision was made by Comra de Evans and ratified by the committee unanimously . If he really succeeds in creating a mathematical m odel of the three-body prob lem that gives a complete solution, our Lord wi ll not come, and the great enterprise of T riso laris on Earth will be ruined. I only shot at Shen Y ufei since she shot at me first. I was acting in self-defense.” Y e nodd ed. “Let us believe you. This is, after all, not the most important issue. I hope we can continue t o trust you. Now , please repeat the request you made to me just now .” Pan was stunned for a second. That she had moved on didn’ t seem to relax him . “I … asked that you openly declare yourself to be an Adventist. After all, the action plan of the Adventists is also your ideal.” “Then repeat the plan of action.” “Human society can no longe r rely on its own power to s olve its problems. It can also no long er rely on its own power to restrain its madness. There fore, we ask ou r Lord to come to this world, and with Itspower , f orcefully watch over us and transform us, so as to create a brand- new , perfect human civilization.” “Are the Adventists loyal believers in this plan?” “Of course! Commander , please do not believe false rumors.” “It’ s not a false rumor!” a man shouted. He made his way to the front. “I’m Rafael, from Israel. Three years ago, my fourteen-year -old son died in an a ccident. I ha d his kidney do nated to a Palestinian girl suf fe ring kidney failure a s an expression of my hope that the two peoples could live together in peace . For this ideal, I was w illing to give my life. Many , many Israelis and Palestinians sincerely strove toward the same goal by my side. But all this was useless . Our home rem ained trapped in the quagmire of cycles of vengeance. “Eventually , I lost hope in the human race and joined the ET O. Desperation turned me from a pacifist into an extremist. Also, probably because I donated so much money to the Or ganization, I became a core member of the Adventists. Let me tell you now , the Adventists have their own secret agenda. “And it is this: The human race is an evil species. Human civilization has committed unfor givable crimes against the Earth and must be punished. The ultimate goal of the Adve ntists is to ask our Lord to ca rry out this divine punishment: the destruction of all humankind.” “The real program of the Adventists is already an open secret,” someone shouted. “But what you d on’ t know is th at this was not a program they evolved into. It was the goal set out at the very beginning; it’ s been t he life-long dream of Mike Evans, the mastermind behind the Adventists. He lied to the Or ganization and fooled everyone, including the commander! Evans has been wo rking to ward this goal f rom the very start. He turned the Adventists into a kingdom of terror pop ulated by extreme environmentalists and madmen who hated the human race.” “I di dn’ t know E vans’ s real thoughts until much later ,” Y e said. “Still, I tried to patch ov er the dif ferences to allow the ET O to remain whole. But some of the other acts committed by Adventists lately have made the ef fort impossible.” Pan said, “Commander , the Adventists are the core of ET O. W ithout us, there is no Earth-T risolaris Movement.”“But this is no excuse for you to monopolize all commun ications between our Lord and the Or ganization.” “W e built the Second Red Coast Base; of course we should operate it.” “The Adventists took advantage of this and committed an unfor givable betrayal of the O r ganization: Y ou intercepted the messages fro m our Lord to the Or ganizat ion and passed on only a small portion of them. Even those, you dist orted. A lso, through the Second Red Coast Base, you sent a lar ge amount of information to our Lord without the Or ganization’ s approval.” Silence descend ed over the m eeting like a monstrous thing. W ang’ s scalp began to tingle. Pan did not answer . His expression became cold, as if to say , Finally , it has happened. “There is much evidence of the Adventists’ betrayal. Comrade Shen Y ufei was one o f the witnesses. Though she belonged to the core group of Adventists, in her heart, she rem ained a resolute Redemptionis t. Y ou only discovered this recently , and she already knew too much. When Evans sent you, he wanted you to kill two people, not one.” Pan looked around, apparently reassessing the situation. His gesture didn’ t go unnoticed by Y e. “Y ou can see tha t most people attending this meeting are comrad es from the Redemptionist faction. I trust that the few Adventists who are here will stand on the side of the Or ganization. But men like Evans and you can no longer b e saved. T o protect the program and ideals of the ET O, we must completely solve the problem of the Adventists.” Silence returned. A few moments later , one of the bodyguards near Y e, a young woman, smiled. She walked toward Pan Han casually . Pan’ s fa ce changed. He stuck a hand inside the lapel of his jac ket, but the youn g woma n dashed quicker than the eye could follow . Before anyone could re act, she wrapped one of her slender arms around Pan’ s n eck, placed her o ther hand o n top of his head, and, by applying her unexpec ted strength at just the right angle, she twis ted Pan’ s head 180 degrees wi th practiced ease. The cracks from his cervical vertebrae breaking stood out against the complete silence. The you ng woman’ s hands immediately let go, as though Pan’ s head was too hot. Pan fell to the grou nd, and the gun that had killed Shen Y ufei slid unde r the table. His body still spasmed, and his eyes remained open, histongue s ticking out. But his head no longer moved, as though it were never a pa rt of the rest of his body . Several men came and dragged him away , the blood oozing from his mouth leaving a long trail. “Ah, Xi ao W ang , you’re here to o. How have you been?” Y e’ s gaze fell on W ang Miao. She smiled kin dly at him and nodded. Then she turned to the o thers. “This is Professor W ang, a member of the Chinese A cademy of Sciences and my friend. He r esearches nanomaterials. This is the first technology our Lord wishes to extinguish from the Earth.” No one looked at W ang, and W a ng had no strength to express himself in any way . He had to pull at the sleeve of the man next to him so that he wouldn’ t fall, but the man lightly brushed his hand away . “Xiao W ang, why don’ t I conti nue to tell you the story of Red Coast from last time? All the comrade s here can listen too. This is no t a waste of time. In this extraordinary mom ent, it is a fine time to review the history of our Or ganization.” “Red Coast.… Y ou weren’ t done?” W ang asked foolishly . Y e s lowly approached the three-body model, seemingly absorbed by the swirling silver spheres. Through the broken window , the setting sun’ s light fell on the model, and the flying spheres intermittently reflected the light onto the rebel commander , like sparks from a bonfire. “No. I’ve only just started,” Y e said softly ."
地球往事 三体 191 23．红岸之五 自从进入红岸基地后，叶文洁就没有想到能够出去，在得知红岸工 程真实目的后（这个绝密信息是基地许多中层干部都不知道的） ，她把 与外界精神上的联系也斩断了，只是埋头于工作。这以后，她更深地介 入到红岸系统的技术核心，开始承担比较重要的研究课题。对于杨卫宁 给予叶文洁的信任，雷志成一直耿耿于怀，但他还是很愿意将重要课题 交到叶文洁手上以叶文洁的身份，她对自己的研究成果没有任何 权利；而基地中，只有雷志成是天体物理专业出身的，是当时少见的知 识分子政委；这样，叶文洁的成果和论文最后都被他占去，使他成了部 队政工干部中又红又专的典型。 调叶文洁进入红岸基地的最初缘由，是她读研究生时发表在《天 文学学报》上的那篇试图建立太阳数学模型的论文。其实，与地球相 比，太阳是一个更简单的物理系统，只是由氢和氦这两种很简单的元素 构成，它的物理过程虽然剧烈，但十分单纯，只是氢至氦的聚变，所以， 有可能建立一个数学模型来对太阳进行较为准确的描述。那论文本来 是一篇很基础的东西，但杨卫宁和雷志成却从中看到了解决红岸监听 系统一个技术难题的希望。 凌日干扰问题一直困扰着红岸的监听操作。这个名词是从刚出现 的通信卫星技术中借来的，当地球、卫星和太阳处于同一条直线时，地 面接收天线对准的卫星是以太阳为背景的，太阳是一个巨大的电磁发 射源，这时地面接收的卫星微波就会受到太阳电磁辐射强烈干扰，这个 问题后来直到二十一世纪都无法解决。红岸所受到的日凌干扰与此类 中国科幻基石丛书 192 似，不同的是干扰源（太阳）位于发射源（外太空）和接收器之间。与通 信卫星相比，红岸所受的凌日干扰出现的时间更频繁，也更严重。实际 的红岸系统又比原设计缩水了许多，监听和发射系统共用一个天线，这 使得监听的时间较为珍贵，日凌干扰也就成为一个严重问题了。 杨卫宁和雷志成的想法很简单：搞清太阳发射的电磁波在监测波 段上的频谱规律和特征，用数字滤波滤掉它，就可排除干扰。两人都是 技术专家，在这外行领导内行的年代，这是难能可贵的。但杨卫宁不是 天体物理专业的，雷志成则是走政工道路的人，在专业上不可能知道得 太深。其实太阳电磁辐射的稳定只局限于包括可见光在内的从近紫外 到中红外波段，在其他的波段上，它的辐射是动荡不定的。叶文洁首先 明智地在第一份研究报告中明确一点：在太阳黑子、耀斑、日冕物质抛 射等太阳剧烈爆发性活动期间，日凌干扰无法排除。于是，研究对象只 局限于太阳正常活动时红岸监测波段内的电磁辐射。 基地内的研究条件还是不错的，资料室可以按课题内容调来较全 的外文资料，还有很及时的欧美学术期刊，在那个年代这是件很不容易 的事。叶文洁还可以通过军线，与中科院两家研究太阳的科研单位联 系，通过传真得到他们的实时观测数据。 叶文洁的研究持续了半年，丝毫看不到成功的希望。她很快发现， 在红岸的观测频率范围内，太阳的辐射变幻莫测。通过对大量观测数据 的分析，叶文洁发现了令她迷惑的神秘之处：有时，上述某一频段辐射 发生突变时，太阳表面活动却平静如常，上千次的观测数据都证实了这 一点。这就很令她费解了。短波和微波频段的辐射不可能穿透几十万公 里的太阳表层来自太阳核心，只能是太阳表层活动产生的，当突变发生 时，这种活动应该能够观测到，如果太阳没有相应的扰动，这狭窄频段 的突变是什么引起的？这事让她越想越觉得神秘。 研究到了山穷水尽的地步，叶文洁决定放弃了。她在最后一份报告 中承认自己无能为力。这件事情应该比较好交待的，军方委托中科院的 几个单位和大学进行的类似研究都以失败告终，杨卫宁不过是想借助 地球往事 三体 193 于叶文洁的过人才华再试一试。而雷志成的真实想法就更简单了，他只 想要叶文洁的论文。这项研究理论性很强，更能显示出他的水平和层 次。现在，社会上疯狂的浪潮渐渐平息，对干部的要求也有了一些变化， 像他这样在政治上成熟、学术上又有造诣的人，是奇缺的，当然前途无 量。至于日凌问题是否能够解决，倒不是他最关心的。 但叶文洁最终还是没有把报告交上去，她想到，如果研究结束，基 地资料室为这个课题进行的资料调集和外文期刊订阅就会停止，她就 再也不可能接触到这么丰富的天体物理学资料了。于是她在名义上还 是将研究进行下去。实际上潜心搞自己的太阳数学模型。 这天夜里，资料室寒冷的阅览室照例只有叶文洁一人，她面前的 长桌上摊开了一堆期刊和文献。完成一段繁琐的矩阵计算后，她呵呵冻 僵的手，拿起了一本最新一期《天体物理学》杂志，仅仅是作为休息，随 便翻了翻，一篇关于木星研究的论文引起了她的注意，论文的提要如 下： 在上期的短讯《太阳系内新的强发射源》中，威尔逊山天文台的哈 里比德森博士公布了一批数据，是有关他在 6月12日和 7月2日对 木星由行星引力导致的自转摆动观测中，意外两次检测到木星本身发出 强烈的电磁辐射，每次持续时间分别为 81秒和 76秒，这批数据记录 了辐射的频率范围和其他参数。在射电爆发期间，观测到木星表面大红 斑状态的某些变化，比德森也在短讯中进行了描述。木星射电爆发在行 星学术界引起很大兴趣，这期刊发的 G麦肯齐的文章，认为这是木星 内部核聚变启动的征兆；下期将刊发井上云石的文章，将木星射电爆发 归结为一个更复杂的机制：内部金属氢板块的运动，并给出了完整的数 学描述。 叶文洁清楚记得这两个日期和时间，当时，红岸监听系统受到了强 烈的日凌干扰。她查了一下运行日志，证实了自己的记忆，只是来自太 阳的日凌干扰比来自木星的电磁辐射到达地球的时间晚了十六分四十 二秒，这关键的十六分四十二秒啊！叶文洁抑制住剧烈的心跳，请资料 中国科幻基石丛书 194 室的有关人员与国家天文台联系，得到了那两个时间木星和地球的位 置坐标。她在黑板上画出了一个大大的三角形，三个顶点分别是太阳、 地球和木星。她在三条边上分别标上距离，在地球顶点标上了两个到达 时间。由木星到地球的距离很容易算出电磁辐射由木星直接到达地球 消耗的时间，她接着又算出了电磁辐射由木星到达太阳，再由太阳到达 地球的时间，两者相差正是十六分四十二秒！ 叶文洁翻出了以前自己搞出的太阳结构数学模型，试图从理论上 找到一些蛛丝马迹。她的目光很快锁定在太阳辐射层中一种叫“能量 镜面” 的东西上。 从日核反应区发出的能量开始是以高能伽马射线的 形式发出，辐射区通过对这些高能粒子的吸收，再发射实现能量传递， 经过无数次这种再吸引再辐射的漫长过程（一个光子脱离太阳可能需 要一千年的时间） ，高能伽马射线经过 X射线、极紫外线、紫外线逐 渐变为可见光和其他形式的辐射。 这些是在太阳研究中早已明确的内容。 叶文洁的数学模型产生的一个新结果是：在这些不同频率辐射的转换 之间，存在着许多明显的界面，辐射区由里向外，每越过一个界面，辐射 频率就明显下降一个等级，这与传统观点认为辐射区的频率是渐变的有 所不同。计算表明，这种界面会将来自低频侧的辐射反射回去，于是 她就想了那么一个命名。 叶文洁开始仔细研究这一层层悬浮在太阳电浆海洋中的飘忽不定 的薄膜，她发现，这种只能在恒星内部的高能海洋中出现的东西，有许 多奇妙的性质，其中最不可思议的是它的“增益反射”特性，而这与太 阳电磁辐射之谜似乎有关。但这种特性过分离奇，难以证实，叶文洁自 己都难以置信，更有可能是令人目眩的复杂计算中产生的一些误导所 致。 现在，叶文洁初步证实了自己关于太阳能量镜面增益反射的猜想： 能量镜面并非简单地反射低频侧的电磁辐射，而是将它放大了！以前观 测到的那些在狭窄频段的神秘突变，其实是来自宇宙间的辐射被放大 后的结果，所以在太阳表面观察不到任何相应的扰动。 地球往事 三体 195 很可能，这一次，太阳收到木星的电磁辐射后又发射出来，只是强 度增加了近亿倍！地球以十六分四十二秒的时间差分别收到了放大前 后的这两次辐射。 太阳是一个电波放大器！ 这里出现一个问题：太阳每时每刻都在接收来自太空的电磁辐射， 包括地球溢出的无线电波，为什么它只放大其中的一部分呢？原因很明 显：除了能量镜面对反射频率的选择外，主要是太阳对流层的屏蔽作 用。表面沸腾不息的对流层位于辐射层之上，是太阳最外一层液态层。 来自太空的电波首先要穿透对流层才能到达辐射层的能量镜面，进而 被放大后反射出去。这就需要射入的电波在功率上超过一个阈值，地球 上的绝大部分的无线电发射都远低于这个阈值，但木星的电磁辐射超过 了 红岸的最大发射功率也超过了这个阈值！ 日凌干扰问题仍未得到解决，但另一个激动人心的可能性出现了： 人类可以将太阳作为一个超级天线，通过它向宇宙中发射电波，这种电 波是以恒星级的能量发出的，它的功率比地球上能够使用的全部发射 功率还要大上亿倍。 地球文明有可能进行Ⅱ型文明能级的发射！ 下一步，需要将那两次木星电磁辐射的波形与红岸受到的日凌干 扰的波形相对照，如果吻合，这个猜想就得到了进一步的证实。 叶文洁向领导提出要求，要与哈里比德森联系，取得那两次木星 电磁辐射的波形记录。这不是一件容易的事情，渠道不好找，还有众多 部门的一道道手续要办，弄岔一点就有里通外国的嫌疑，叶文洁只好等 待。 但还有一个更直接的证实方法：红岸发射系统以超过那个阈值的 功率直接向太阳发射电波。 叶文洁找到了领导，提出了这个要求，但没敢直接说出自己的想 法，那太玄乎了，肯定遭到否决，她只是说这是一次对太阳研究进行的 中国科幻基石丛书 196 试验，将红岸发射系统作为对太阳的探测雷达，通过接收回波来分析反 映太阳电磁辐射的一些信息。雷志成和杨卫宁都有很深的技术背景，想 骗他们不容易，但叶文洁说出的这项试验，在西方太阳研究中确实有过 先例，事实上，这比正在进行中的对类地行星的雷达探测在技术上还简 单些。 “叶文洁呀，你越来越出格了，你的课题，在理论上搞搞就行了，有 必要弄这么大动作吗？”雷志成摇摇头说。 “政委，可能有重大发现。实验是必须的，只这一次，行吗？”叶文洁 苦苦央求道。 杨卫宁说： “雷政委，要不就做一次？操作上好像没什么太大困难， 回波在发射后传回要……” “十几分钟吧。 ”雷志成说。 “这样红岸系统正好有时间转换到接收状态。 ” 雷志成再次摇头， “我知道在技术上和工作量上都没什么，但你 ……唉，杨总啊，你脑子里缺的就是这根弦啊向红太阳发射超强烈 的电波，你想过这种实验的政治含义吗？ ” 杨卫宁和叶文洁一时瞠目结舌，他们并不是感到这理由荒唐，相 反，是为自己没有想到而后怕。那个年代，对一切事物的政治图解已达 到了极其荒唐的程度，叶文洁上交的研究报告，雷志成必须进行仔细审 阅，对有关太阳的技术用词反复斟酌修改，像“太阳黑子”这类词汇都 不能出现。向太阳发射超强电波的实验当然可以做出一千个正面解释。 但只要有一个反面解释，就可能有人面临灭顶之灾。雷志成拒绝实验的 这个理由，确实是不可能被推翻的。 叶文洁没有放弃，其实只要冒不大的险，做成这事很容易。红岸发 射系统的发射器是超高功率的设备，全部使用“文革”期间生产的国产 元件，由于质量不过关，故障率很高，不得不在每十五次发射后就全面 检修一次，每次检修完成后都要例行试运行，参加这种发射的人很少， 目标和其他发射参数也是比较随意的。 地球往事 三体 197 在一次值班中，叶文洁被分配进行例行的检修后的测试，由于试发射 省去了很多操作，在场的除叶文洁外只有五个人，其中三个是对设备原 理知之甚少的操作员，另外的一名技术员和一名工程师已在持续了两 天的检修中疲惫不堪，心不在焉。叶文洁首先将发射功率设置到刚刚超 过太阳增益反射理论上的阈值（这已是红岸发射系统的最大功率了） ， 频率设定在最可能被能量镜面放大的频率上，借测试天线机械性能为 名，将它对准已斜挂在西天的太阳，发射的内容仍同每次正规发射一 样。 这是 1971 年秋天一个晴朗的下午，事后叶文洁多次回忆那一时 刻，并没有什么特别的感觉，只是焦急，盼发射快些完成，一方面是怕在 场的同事发现，虽然她想好了推托的理由，但以损耗元件的最大功率进 行发射实验毕竟是不正常的；同时，红岸发射系统的定位设备不是设计 用于瞄准太阳的，叶文洁用手就能感到光学系统在发烫，如果烧坏麻烦 就大了。太阳在西天缓缓下落，叶文洁不得不手动跟踪，这时，红岸天线 像一棵巨大的向日葵，面对着下落中的太阳缓缓转动。当发射完成的红 灯亮起时。她浑身已被汗水浸透了。扭头一看，三名操作员正在控制台 上按手册依次关闭设备，那名工程师在控制室的一角喝水，技术员则靠 在长椅子上睡着了。不管后来的历史学家和文学家们如何描述，当时的 真实情景就是这样平淡无奇。 发射一完成，叶文洁就冲出控制室，跑进杨卫宁的办公室，喘着气 说： “快，让基地电台在 12000 兆赫上接收！ ” “收什么？”杨总工程师惊奇地看着头发被汗水粘到脸上的叶文 洁，与灵敏度极高的红岸接收系统相比，基地用于与外界联系的常规军 用电台只是个玩具。 “也许能收到一些东西，红岸系统没有时间转换到接收状态了！ ” 叶文洁说。正常情况下，红岸接收系统的预热和切换只需十多分钟，而 现在接收系统也在检修中，很多模块拆卸后还未组装，根本无法在短时 间内运行。 中国科幻基石丛书 198 杨卫宁看了叶文洁几秒钟，拿起了电话，吩咐机要通讯室按叶文洁 说的去做。 “那个电台的精度，大概只能收到月球上外星人的信号。 ” “信号来自太阳。 ”叶文洁说。窗外，太阳的边缘已接近天边的山 顶，血红血红的。 “你用红岸系统向太阳发信号了？”杨卫宁紧张地问。 叶文洁点点头。 “这事不要对别人说，下不为例，绝对的下不为例！ ”杨卫宁警觉地 回头看看门口说。 叶文洁又点点头。 “这有什么意义嘛，回波一定是极弱的，远远超出了常规电台的接 收能力。 ” “不，如果我的猜想是正常的。将收到极强的回波，强得……难以 想象，只要发射功率超过一个阈值，太阳……就能成亿倍地放大电 波！” 杨卫宁又奇怪地看着叶文洁，后者沉默了。两人静静地等着，杨卫 宁能够清晰地听到叶文洁的呼吸和心跳，对她刚才的话他没太在意，只 是埋藏了多少年的感情又涌上心头。但他只能控制着自己，等待着。二 十分钟后，杨卫宁拿起电话，要通了通讯室，简单地问了两句。 “什么都没收到。 ”杨卫宁放下电话说。 叶文洁长出了一口气，好半天才点点头。 “那个美国天文学家回信了。 ”杨卫宁拿出一个厚厚的信封递给叶 文洁，上面盖满了海关的印章。叶文洁迫不及待地拆开信封，先是大概 扫了一眼哈里比德森的信，信上说他没有想到中国也有研究行星电磁 学的同行，希望多多联系和合作。他寄来的是两叠纸，上面完整地记录 了来自木星两次电磁辐射的波形。波形显然是从长条信号记录纸上复 印下来的，要对起来看，而这个时候的中国人，还大多没有见过复印机。 叶文洁将几十张复印纸在地板上排成两排，排到一半时她就已经不抱 任何希望了，她太熟悉那两次日凌干扰的波形了，与这两条肯定对不 地球往事 三体 199 上。 叶文洁慢慢地从地上将那两排复印纸收拾起来。杨卫宁蹲下帮她 收拾，当他将手中的一打纸递给这个他的内心深处爱着的姑娘时，看到她 摇摇头笑了一下，那笑很凄婉，令他心颤。 “怎么？”他轻轻地问，没有意识到自己同她说话从来没有这么轻 声过。 “没什么，一场梦，醒了而已。 ”叶文洁说完又笑了笑，抱着那摞复 印纸和信封走出了办公室。她回到住处，取了饭盒去食堂，才发现只剩 下馒头和咸菜了。食堂的人又没好气地告诉她要关门了，她只好端着饭 盒走了出来，走到那道悬崖前，坐在草地上啃着凉馒头。 这时太阳已经落山，大兴安岭看上去是灰蒙蒙的一片，就像叶文洁 的生活，在这灰色中，梦尤其显得绚丽灿烂。但梦总是很快会醒的，就像 那轮太阳，虽然还会升起来，已不带有新的希望。这时叶文洁突然看到 了自己的后半生，也只有无际的灰色。她含着眼泪，又笑了笑，继续啃凉 馒头。 叶文洁不知道，就在这时，地球文明向太空发出的第一声能够被听 到的啼鸣，已经以太阳为中心，以光速飞向整个宇宙。恒星级功率的强 劲电波，如磅礴的海潮，此时已越过了木星轨道。 这时，在 12000 兆赫波段上，太阳是银河系中最亮的一颗星。,"2 2 R e d C o a s t V Since she entered Red Coast Base, Y e W enjie had never thought of leaving. After she learned the real pur pose of the Red Coast Project , top-secret information that even many mid-level cadres at the base didn’ t know , she cut o f f h er spirit ual connection to the outside world and devoted herself to her work. Thereafter , she bec ame even more deeply embedded in the technical core of Red Coast, and began to take on more import ant research topics. Commissar Lei never for got tha t it was Chief Y ang who first tru sted Y e, but Lei was happy to assign im portant topics to her . Given Y e’ s status, she had no rights t o the results of her research. And Lei, who had studied astrophysics, wa s a political of fi cer who was also an intellectua l, rare at the time. Th us he could take credit for all of Y e’ s research results and papers, and cast himself as an exemp lary political of ficer with both technical acumen and revolutionary zeal. The Red Coast Project had initially requisitioned Y e because of a paper on an attempted mathematical model of the sun she had published in the Journal of Astr ophysics as a gra duate student. Compar ed to the Earth, the sun was a far simpler physical system, made almost entirely o f hydrogen and helium. Though its phys ical processes were violent, they were relatively straigh tforward, only fusing hydrogen into helium. Thus, it was likely that a m athematical model of the sun could describ e it ratherprecisely . The paper was basic, but Lei and Y ang saw in it a hope for a solution to a technical dif ficulty faced by the Red Coast monitoring system. Solar outages, a common problem in satellite communications, had always plagued the Red Coast monitoring operations. When the Earth, an artificial sat ellite, and the sun are in a straight line, the l ine of sight from the ground-based antenna to the satellite w ill have the sun as its back ground. The sun is a giant source of elec tromagnetic radiation, and, as a result, sat ellite transmissions to the ground will be overwhelmed by interference from the solar radiation. This problem could not be completely solved, even in the twenty-first century . The interference that Red Coast had to deal with was similar , but the source of interference (the sun) was between the source of the t ransmission (outer space) and the ground-based receiver . Compared to communication satellites, the solar outages suf fered by Red Coast were more frequent and more se vere. Red Coast Base a s constructed was also much more modest than its original design, such th at the transmission and monitoring systems shared the same antenna. This m ade the times available for monitoring even more precious, and solar outages even more of a problem. Lei and Y ang’ s idea for eliminating interference was very simple: ascertain the frequency spectrum and characteristics of solar radiation in the monitored rang e, and then filter it out digitally . Both of them were technical, and at that time, when the ignorant often led the kno wledgeable, that was a rare bit of fortune. But Y ang wasn’ t a specialist in a strophysics, and Lei had taken the path of becoming a political of ficer , which prevented him from accruing in-depth technical know-how . In reality , electromagnetic radiation from the sun is only stable within the limited range from near - ultraviolet to mid-infrared (inc luding visible light). In other ranges, the radiation is quite volatile and unpredictable. T o set the right expectations, Y e made it clear in her first research report that duri ng periods of intense solar activitysunspots, solar flares, coronal mass e jections, and so onit was impossible to eliminate solar interference. Thus, her research tar get was limited to radiation within the frequency ranges monitored by Red Coast during periods of normal solar activity . Research condit ions at the base weren’ t too bad. The librar y could obtain foreign-language materials related to the topic, including timelyEuropean and American academic journals. In those years, this was no easy feat. Y e also could use the milit ary phone line to connect to the two groups conducting solar science research within the Chinese Academy of Sciences and obtain their observation data by fax. After half a yea r of study , Y e saw no glimpse of hope. She quickly discovered that within the frequency ranges monitored by Red Coast, solar radiation fluctuated unpredictably . By analyzing lar ge amounts of observed data, Y e discovered a puzzling mystery . Sometimes, during one of the sudden fluctuations in solar radiation, the surface of the sun was calm. Since hundreds of thousands of kilometers of solar material would absorb any shortwave and microwave radiation originating from the core of the sun, the radiatio n must have co me from activities on its surfa ce, so there should have been observable surface activity when these fluctuations occurred. If there were no corresponding surface disturbances, what caused these su dden changes to the narrow frequency ranges? The more she thought about it, the more mysterious it seemed. Eventually Y e ran out of ideas and decided to give up. In her last report, she con ceded that she could n ot solve the problem. This shouldn’ t have been a big deal. The military had asked several groups within universities and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to research the same issue, and all of those ef forts had failed. But Y ang wanted to try one more time, relying on Y e’ s extraordinary talent. Lei’ s agenda was even simpler: He just wanted Y e’ s paper . The research topic was highly theoretical an d would show of f his expertis e and skill. Now tha t the chaos in society w as finally subsiding, the demands on cadres were als o chang ing. There was an acute need for men like him , politically mature and academically accom plished. Of course he would h ave a bright future. As to wh ether the problem of interference from solar outages could be solved, he didn’ t really care. But in the end, Y e didn’ t hand in her report. She thought that if the research project were terminated, the base library would stop receiving foreign language journals and other research materials, and she would no longer have access to such a rich trove of astrophysics references. So she nominally continued her research, while in reality she focused on refining her mathematical model of the sun.One night, Y e w as, as usual, the only person in the cold reading room of the base library . On the long tab le in front of her , a pile of documents and journals were spread open. After completing a set of tedious and cumbersome ma trix calculations , she blew on her hands to warm them, and picked up the la test issue of the Journal of Astr ophysics to take a break. As she flipped through it, a brief note about Jupiter caught her attention: Last issue, in “A New , Powerful Radiation Source W ithin the Solar System,” Dr . Harry Peterson of Mount W ilson Observatory published a set of data accidentally obtained while observing J upiter ’ s pr ecession on June 12 and July 2, during which strong electroma gnetic radiation was detected, lasting 81 seconds and 76 seconds, respectively . The data included the fr equency ranges of the radiation as well as other parameters. During the radio outbursts, Peterson also observed certain changes in the Great Red Spot. This discovery drew a lot of interest from planetary scientists. In this issue, G. McKenzie’ s article ar gues that it was a sign of fusion starting within Jupiter ’ s core. In the next issue we will p ublish Inoue Kumoseki’ s article, which attributes the Jovian radio outbursts to a more complicated mechanismthe movements of internal metallic hydrogen platesand gives a com plete mathematical description. Y e clear ly remembered the two dates noted in the paper . During those windows, the Red Coast monitoring system had also received strong interference from solar outages. She checked the operations diary and confirmed her memory . The times were close, but the solar outages had occurred sixteen minutes and forty-two seconds after the arrival of the Jovian radio outbursts on Earth. The sixte en minu tes and forty-two seconds ar e critical! Y e tried to calm her wil d heartbeat, and asked the librarian to contact the National Observatory to obtain the ephemeris of the Earth’ s and Jupiter ’ s positions during those two time periods. She drew a big triangle on the blackboard with the sun, the Ea rth, and Jupiter a t the vertices. She marked the distances along the three edges, and wrote down the two arrival times next to the Earth. From the distance between the Earth and Jupiter it was easy to figure out the tim e it took for the radio outbursts to travel between the two. Then she calculated the time it would take the radio outbursts to go from Jupiter to the sun, and then from the sun to the Earth. Th e dif ference between the two was exactly sixteen minutes and forty-two seconds.Y e r eferred to he r solar structure mathematical model and tried to find a theoretical explanation. Her eye s were drawn to her description of what she called “ener gy mirrors” within the solar radiation zone. Ener gy p roduced by reaction within the solar core is initially in the form of h igh-ener gy gamma rays. T he radiation zone, the region of the sun’ s interior that surrounds the core, absorbs these high-ener gy photons and re- emits them at a slightly lower ener gy level. After a long period of successive abso rption and re-emission (a photon might take a thousand years to leave the sun), gamma rays become x-rays, extreme ultraviolet, ultraviolet, then eventually turn into visible light and other forms of radiation. Such were the k nown facts about the sun. But Y e’ s model led to a new result: As solar radiation dropped through these dif ferent frequencies on its way through the radiation zo ne, there were boundaries between the subzones for each type of radiation. As ener gy crossed each boundary , the radiation freque ncy stepped down a grade sharply . This was di f ferent from the traditional view that the radiation frequency lowered gradually as ener gy passed from the core ou twards. Her calculations showe d that these boundaries would reflect radiation coming from the lower -frequency side, which was why she named the boundaries “ener gy mirrors.” Y e had carefu lly studied these membranelike boundary surfaces suspended in the high-ener gy pl asma ocean of the sun and discovered them to be full of wonderful properties. One of the most incredible ch aracteristics she named “gain reflectivity .” However , the characteristic wa s so bizarre that it was hard to confirm, and even Y e herself didn’ t quite believe it was real. It seemed more likely an artifact of some error in the dizzying, complex calculations. But now , Y e made the first step in confirming her guess about the gain reflectivity of solar ener gy mirrors: The ener gy mirrors not only reflected radiation comin g from the lower -frequency side, but amplified it. All the mysterious sudd en fluctuations within narrow frequency bands that she had observed were in fact the result of other radiation coming from space being amplified after reflecting of f an ener gy mirror in the sun. That was why there were no observable disturbances on the surface of the sun. This time, after the Jovian radio outbursts reached the sun, they were re- emitted, as if b y a mirror , afte r being amplified about a hund red milliontimes. The Earth received both sets of emissions, before and after the amplification, separated by sixteen minutes and forty-two seconds. The sun was an amplifier for radio waves. However , there was a question: The sun must be r eceiving electromagnetic radiation from space every second, including radio waves emitted by the E arth. Why were only some of the waves amp lified? The answer w as sim ple: In addition to the selectivity of the ener gy mirrors for frequencies they would reflect, the main reason was the shieldi ng ef fect of the solar convec tion zone. The endlessly boiling convection zone situated outside the radiation zone was the outermost liquid layer of the sun. The radio waves coming from space must first penetrate the convection zone to reach the ener gy mirrors in the radiation zone, where they would be amplified and reflected back out. This meant that in order to reach the ener gy m irrors, the waves would have to be more powerful than a threshold value. T he vast majority of Earth-based radio sources could no t cross this threshold, but the Jovian radio outburst did And Red Coast’ s maximum transmission power also exceeded the threshold. The problem with solar outages was not resolved, but another exciting possibility prese nted itself: Humans could use the sun as a superantenna, and, thr ough it, broadcast radio waves to the universe. The radio waves would be sent w ith the power of the sun, hundreds of millions of times greater than the total usable transmission power on Earth. Earth civilizatio n had a way to transmit at the level of a Kardashev T ype II civilization. The next step was to compare the waveforms of the two Jovian radio outbursts with the waveforms of the solar outages received by Red Coast. If they matched, then her guess would receive further confirmation. Y e made her request to the base leadership to contact Harry Peterson and obta in the waveform records of the two Jovian radio outbursts. This was not easy . It was dif ficult to find the right communication channels, and numerous bureaucracies required layers of formal paperwork. Any error could le ad to her being suspect ed of acting as a foreign spy . So Y e had to wait. But ther e was a more direct w ay to prove the hypothesis: Re d Coast itself could transmit radio waves directly at the sun at a power levelexceeding the threshold value. Y e again made her request to the base leadership. But she didn’ t dare to give her real reasonit was too fantastic, and she would have been turned down f or certain. Instead, she explained that she wanted to do an experiment for her solar research: The Red Coast transmission system would b e used as a solar explora tion radar whose echoes could be analyzed to obtain some information about solar radiation. Lei and Y an g both had deep technical backgrounds, and wouldn’ t have been easily foo led, but the experiment desc ribed by Y e did have real precedents in W estern solar research. In fact, her suggestion was technically easier than the radar exploration of terrestrial planets already being conducted. “Y e W e njie, you’re getting out of line,” said Commissar Lei. “Y our research should be focused on t heory . Do we really need to go to so much trouble?” Y e begg ed, “Com missar , it’ s possible that a big discovery will be made. Experiments are absolutely necessary . I just want to try it once, please?” Chief Y ang said, “Commissar Lei, maybe we should try once. It doesn’ t seem to be too dif ficult op erationally . Receiving the echoes after transmission would take” “T en, fifteen minutes,” Lei said. “Then Red Coast has just eno ugh time to switch from trans mission mode to monitoring mode.” Lei shook his head again. “I know that it’ s technically and operationally feasible. But you … eh, Chief Y ang, you just lack the sensitivity for this kind of thing. Y ou want to aim a superpowerful radio beam at the red sun. Have you thought about the political symbolism of such an experiment?”32 Y ang an d Y e were both utterly stunned, but they did not thi nk Lei’ s objection ridiculous. Just the opposite: They were horrified that they themselves had not thought of it. During those years, findi ng political symbolism in everything had rea ched absurd levels. The research reports Y e turned in had to be carefully reviewed by Lei so that even tech nical terms related to the s un could be repeatedly revised to remove po litical risk. T erms like “sunspots” were forbidden.33 An experiment that sent a powerful radio tra nsmission at the sun co uld of course be interpreted in a thousand positive ways, but a single negative interpretation would be eno ugh to bringpolitical disaster on everyone. Lei’ s reason for refusing to allow the experiment was truly unassailable. Y e didn’ t give up, though. In fa ct, as long as she didn’ t take excessive risk, it wasn’ t d if ficult to accomplish her goal. The Red Coast transmitter was ultra-high-powered, but all of its components were domestically produced during the Cultural Revolution. As the quality of the components was not up to par , the fault rate was very high. After every fifteenth transmission, th e entire system had to be overhauled, and after each overhaul, there would be a tes t transmission. Few people attended these tests, and the tar gets and other parameters were arbitrarily selected. One tim e when she was on duty , Y e was assigned to work durin g one of the test transmis sions after an ov erhaul. Because a test transmission omitted many operational steps, only Y e and five others were present. Three of them were low-level operators who knew little about the principles behind the equipment. The remaining two were a technician and an engineer , both exhausted and not paying much attention after two days of overhaul work. Y e first adjusted the test transm ission power to exceed the threshold value for her gain-reflective solar e ner gy mirror theory , using the maximum power o f the Red Coast transmission system. Then she set the f requency to the value most l ikely to be amplified by the ener gy mirror . And under the guise of testing the antenna’ s mechanical components, she aimed it at the setting sun in the west. The content of the transmission remained the same as usual. This was a cle ar afternoon in the autumn of 1971. Afterwa rds, Y e recalled the event many times b ut couldn’ t remember any special feelings except a nxiety , a desire for the transmission to be completed quickly . First, she was afraid to be discovered by her colleagues. Even though she had thought of some excuses, it was still unusual to use maximum power for a test transmission , because doing so would wear down the com ponents. In addition, the Red Coast transmission system’ s positioning equipment was never de signed to be aimed at the sun. Y e could feel the eyepiece growing hot. If it burnt out she would be in real trouble. As the sun set slowly in the west, Y e had to manually track it. The Red Coast antenna seemed like a giant sunflower at that moment, slowly turning to f ollow the descending sun . By the time the red light indicating transmission completion lit up, she was already soaked in sweat.She glanced around. The three operators at the control panel were shutting down the equipment piece by piece in accordance with the instructions in the operating ma nual. The engineer was drinking a glass of water in a corner of the control room, and the technician was a sleep in his chair . No matter how historians and writers later tried to portray the scene, the reality at the time was completely prosaic. The tran smission completed, Y e rushed out of the control room and dashed i nto Y an g W eining’ s of fice. Catching her breath, she said, “T ell the base station to begin monitoring the twelve thousand megahertz channel!” “What a re we receiving?” Chie f Y ang looked in surprise at Y e, strands of h air stuck to her sweaty fa ce. Compared to the highly se nsitive Red Coast m onitoring system, the conventional military-grade radionormally used by the base for communicating with the outsidewas only a toy . “Maybe we’ll get something. T here’ s no time to change the Red Coast systems to monitoring mode!” Normally , warming up and switching over to the monitoring system required a little more than ten minutes. But right now the m onitoring system was also being overhauled. Many modul es had been taken apart and remained unas sembled, rendering them inoperable in the short term. Y ang stared at Y e for a few seconds, and then picked up the ph one and ordered the communications of fice to follow Y e’ s direction. “Given the low sensitivity of th at radio, we can probably only receive signals from extraterrestrials on the moon.” “The sig nal comes from the sun,” Y e said. Outside the window , the sun’ s edge was already approaching the mountains on the hor izon, red as blood. “Y ou used Red Coast to send a signal to the sun?” Y ang asked anxiously . Y e nodded. “Don’ t tell anyone else. This m ust never happen again. Never!” Y ang looked behind him to be sure there was no one at the door . Y e nodded again. “What’ s the point? The echo wave must be extremely weak, far outside the sensitivity of a conventional radio.” “No. If my gue ss is right, we should get an extremely strong echo. It will be more powerful than … I can hardly imagine. As long as thetransmission po wer exceeds a certain threshold, the sun can amplify the signal a hundred millionfold.” Y ang looked at Y e strangely . Y e said nothing. They both w aited in silence. Y ang could clearly hear Y e’ s breath and heartbeat. He hadn’ t paid much attention to what she had said, but the feelings he had buried in his heart for many years resurfaced. He could only restrain himself, waiting. T wenty minutes later , Y ang picked up the phone, called the communications of fice, and asked a few simple questions. He put the phone down. “They received nothing.” Y e let out a long-held breath and eventually nodded. “That American astronomer res ponded, though.” Y ang took out a thick envelope covered with customs stamps and handed it to Y e. She tore the envelope open and scanned Ha rry Peterson’ s letter . The letter said that he had not imagined that there would be colleagues in China studying planetary electromagnetism, and that he wished to collaborate and exchange more information in the future. He had also sent two stacks of paper: the complete record of the waveform s of the radio outbursts from Jupiter . They were cle arly photocopied from the long signal recording tape, and would have to be pieced together . Y e t ook the dozens of sheets of photocopier paper and starte d lining them up in two columns on the floor . Halfway through the ef fo rt she gave up any hope. She was very familiar with the waveforms of the interference from the two solar outages. They didn’ t match these two. Y e s lowly picked up the photo copies from the floor . Y ang c rouched down to help her . When he handed the stack of paper to this woman he loved w ith all his heart, he saw her smile. The smile was so sad that his heart trembled. “What’ s wrong? ” he asked, not realizing that he had never spoken to her so softly . “Nothing. I’m just waking up from a dream.” Y e smiled again. S he took the stack of photocopies and the envelope and left the of fice. She went back to h er room, picked up her lunch box, and went to the cafeteria. Only mantou buns and pick les were left, and the cafeteria workers told her impatiently that they were closing. So she had no choice but to carry her lunch bo x outside and walk nex t to the lip of the clif f, where she sat down on the grass to chew the cold mantou .The sun had already set. The Gr eater Khingan Mountains were gray and indistinct, just like Y e’ s life. In this gray life, a dream appeare d especially colorful and bright. But one alw ays awoke from a dream, just like the sun which, though it would rise again, brought no fresh hope. In that moment Y e saw the rest of her life suf fu sed with an endless grayness. W ith tears in her eyes, she smiled again, and continued to chew the cold mantou . Y e didn’ t know that at that mom ent, the first cry that could be heard in space fro m civil ization on Earth was already spreading out from the sun to the universe at the speed of light. A star -powered radio wave, like a majestic tide, had already crossed the orbit of Jupiter . Right th en, at the frequency of 12,000 MHz, the sun was the brightest star in the entire Milky W ay ."
中国科幻基石丛书 200 24．红岸之六 以后的八年，是叶文洁一生中最平静的一段时间。 “文革”中的经 历造成的惊惧渐渐平息，她终于能够稍微放松一下自己的精神。红岸工 程已经完成了实验和磨合期，一切渐渐转入常规，需要解决的技术问题 越来越少，工作和生活变得有规律了。 平静之后，一直被紧张和恐惧压抑着的记忆开始苏醒，叶文洁发 现，真正的伤痛才刚刚开始。噩梦般的记忆像一处处死灰复燃的火种， 越烧越旺，灼烧着她的心灵。对于普通的女性，也许时间能够渐渐愈合 这些创伤，毕竟， “文革”中有她这样遭遇的女性太多了，比起她们中的 很多人，她算是幸运的。但叶文洁是一位科学女性，她拒绝忘却，而且是 用理性的目光直视那些伤害了她的疯狂和偏执。 其实，叶文洁对人类恶的一面的理性思考，从她看到《寂静的春 天》那天就开始了。随着与杨卫宁关系的日益密切，叶文洁通过他，以 收集技术资料的名义，购进了许多外文的哲学和历史经典著作，斑斑血 迹装饰着的人类历史令她不寒而栗，而那些思想家的卓越思考，将她引 向人性的最本质也是最隐秘之处。 其实，就是在这近乎世外桃源的雷达峰上，人类的非理性和疯狂仍 然每天都历历在目。叶文洁看到，山下的森林，每天都在被她昔日的战 友疯狂砍伐，荒地面积日益扩大，仿佛是大兴安岭被剥去皮肤的部分， 当这些区域连成一片后，那幸存的几片林木倒显得不正常了。烧荒的大 火在那光秃秃的山野上燃起，雷达峰成了那些火海中逃生的鸟儿的避 难所，当火烧起来时，基地里那些鸟凄惨的叫声不绝于耳，它们的羽毛 地球往事 三体 201 都被烧焦了。 在更远的外部世界，人类的疯狂已达到了文明史上的顶峰。那段时 间， 正是美苏争霸最激烈的时期， 分布在两个大陆上的数不清的发射井 中，在幽灵般潜行在深海下的战略核潜艇上，能将地球毁灭几十次的核 武器一触即发。仅一艘“北极星”或“台风”级潜艇上的分导核弹头，就 足以摧毁上百座城市，杀死几亿人。但普通人对此仍然一笑置之，似乎 与己无关。 作为天体物理学家，叶文洁对核武器十分敏感。她知道这是恒星才 具有的力量。她更清楚，宇宙中还有更可怕的力量，有黑洞，有反物质， 等等，与那些力量相比，热核炸弹不过是一根温柔的蜡烛。如果人类得 到了那些力量中的一种，世界可能在瞬间被汽化，在疯狂面前，理智是 软弱无力的。 进入红岸基地四年后，叶文洁和杨卫宁组成了家庭。杨卫宁是真心 爱着叶文洁的，为了爱情，他放弃了自己的前途。这时， “文革”最激烈 的时期已经过去，政治环境相对温和了一些，杨卫宁没有因为自己的婚 姻受到迫害，但因为娶了一个戴着反革命帽子的妻子，被视为政治上不 成熟，丢掉了总工程师的职位。他和妻子能够作为普通技术人员留在基 地，也仅仅是因为技术上离不开他们。对于叶文洁来说，接受杨卫宁的 爱情主要是出于一种报恩的心理，在那最危难的时刻，如果不是他将自 己带进这个与世隔绝的避风港，她可能早已不在人世了。杨卫宁很有才 华，风度和修养俱佳，不是一个让她讨厌的人，但她自己已心如死灰，很 难再燃起爱情的火焰了。 对人类本质的思考，使叶文洁陷入了深重的精神危机。她首先面临 的，是一种奉献目标的缺失，她曾是一个理想主义者，需要将自己的才 华贡献给一个伟大的目标，现在却发现，自己以前做的一切全无意义， 以后也不可能有什么有意义的追求。这种心态发展下去，她渐渐觉得这 个世界是那样的陌生。她不属于这里，这种精神上的流浪感残酷地折磨 中国科幻基石丛书 202 着她，在组成家庭后，她的心灵反而无家可归了。 这天叶文洁值夜班。这是最孤寂的时刻，在静静的午夜，宇宙向它 的聆听者展示着广漠的荒凉。叶文洁最不愿意看的，就是显示器上缓缓 移动的那条曲线，那是红岸接收到的宇宙电波的波形，无意义的噪声。 叶文洁感到这条无限长的曲线就是宇宙的抽象， 一头连着无限的过去， 另一头连着无限的未来，中间只有无规律无生命的随机起伏，一个个高 低错落的波峰就像一粒粒大小不等的沙子，整条曲线就像是所有沙粒 排成行形成的一维沙漠，荒凉寂寥，长得更令人无法忍受。你可以沿着 它向前向后走无限远，但永远找不到归宿。 但今天，当叶文洁扫了一眼波形显示器后，发现有些异样。即使是 专业人员，也很难仅凭肉眼看出波形是否携带信息，但叶文洁对宇宙噪 声的波形太熟悉了，眼前移动的波形，似乎多了某种说不出来的东西， 这条起伏的细线像是有了灵魂，她敢肯定，眼前的电波是被智能调制 的！叶文洁冲到另一台主机终端前，察看计算机对目前接收内容识别度 的判别，发现识别度是 AAAAA ！！在这之前，红岸接收到的宇宙电波，识 别度从未超过 C，如果达到 A，波段包含智能信息的可能性就大于百分 之九十：连续五个 A是一个极端情况，它意味着接收到的信息使用的就 是红岸发射信息的语言！叶文洁打开了红岸译解系统，这个软件能对识 别度大于 B的信息进行试译解，在整个红岸监听过程中，它从未被正式 使用过。按软件试验运行中的情况，翻译一段可能的智能编码可能需要 几天甚至几个月的运算时间，出来的结果多半还是译解失败。但这次， 原始文件刚刚提交，几乎没有时间间隔，屏幕上就显示译解完成。叶文 洁打开结果文件，人类第一次读到了来自宇宙中另一个世界的信息，其 内容出乎所有人的想象，它是三条重复的警告： 不要回答！ 不要回答！ ！ 不要回答！ ！ ！ 在令她头晕目眩的激动和迷惑中，叶文洁接着译解了第二段信息： 地球往事 三体 203 这个世界收到了你们的信息。 我是这个世界的一个和平主义者，我首先收到信息是你们文明的 幸运。警告你们：不要回答！不要回答！ ！不要回答！ ！ ！ 你们的方向上有千万颗恒星，只要不回答，这个世界就无法定位发 射源。 如果回答，发射源将被定位，你们的行星系将遭到入侵，你们的世 界将被占领！ 不要回答！不要回答！ ！不要回答！ ！ ！ 看着显示屏上闪动的绿色字迹，叶文洁已经无法冷静思考，她那被 激动和震撼抑制了的智力只能理解以下的事实：现在距她上次向太阳 发送信息不到九年，那么这些信息的发射源距地球只有四光年左右，它 只能来自距我们最近的恒星系：半人马座三星！ 宇宙不荒凉，宇宙不空旷，宇宙充满了生机！人类将目光投向宇宙 的尽头，但哪里想到，在距他们最近的恒星中，就存在着智慧生命！ 叶文洁看看波形显示，信息仍源源不断地从太空中涌进红岸天线， 她打开另一个接口，启动了实时译解，接收到的信息被立刻显示出来。 在以后的四个多小时中，叶文洁知道了三体世界的存在，知道了那个一 次次浴火重生的文明，也知道了他们星际移民的企图。 凌晨四点多，来自半人马座的信息结束了，译解系统开始无结果地 运行，不断发出失败信息，红岸监听系统所听到的，又是宇宙荒凉的噪 声。 但叶文洁可以确定，刚才的一切不是梦。 太阳确实是一个超级天线，但八年前那次试验中为什么没有收到 回波，为什么木星的辐射波形与后来的太阳辐射对不上？叶文洁后来想 出了许多原因，基地的电台可能根本不能接收那个频段的电波，或者收 到后只是一团噪音，就认为是什么都没有收到。至于后者，很可能是因 为太阳在放大电波的同时，还叠加了一个波形，这个波形是有规律的， 在外星文明的译解系统中很容易被剔除，但在她的肉眼看来，木星和太 中国科幻基石丛书 204 阳的辐射波形就大不相同了。这一点后来得到了证实。叠加的是一个正 弦波。 她警觉地四下看看。主机房中值班的还有三人，其中两人在一个角 落聊天，一人在终端前打瞌睡，而在监听系统的信息处理部分，能够查 看接收内容识别度和访问译解系统的终端只有她面前这两台。她不动 声色地迅速操作，将已接收到的信息全部转存到一个多重加密的隐形 子目录中，用一年前接收到的一段噪声代替了这五个小时的内容。 然后，她从终端上将一段简短的信息输入红岸发射系统的缓存区。 叶文洁起身走出了监听主控室的大门，一阵冷风吹到她滚烫的脸 上，东方晨曦初露，她沿着被晨光微微照亮的石子路，向发射主控室走 去，在她的上方，红岸天线的巨掌无声地向宇宙张开着。晨曦照出了门 口哨兵那黑色的剪影，像往常一样，叶文洁进门时他没有理会。发射主 控室比监听主控室要暗许多，叶文洁穿过一排排机柜，径直走向控制 台，熟练地扳动十几个开关，启动了发射系统的预热。坐在控制台旁边 的两名值班员抬起头用困乏的眼睛看了看她，其中一人又扭头看了看 墙上的钟表，然后一人继续打瞌睡，另一人则翻看着可能已看了许多遍 的报纸。在基地里，叶文洁在政治上自然没有任何地位，但在技术上有 一定的自由，她常常在发射前检查设备，虽然今天太早了些，距发射操 作还有三个小时，但提前预热也是不奇怪的。 漫长的半个小时过去了，叶文洁在这期间重设了发射频率，将其置 于太阳能量镜面反射的最优值上，将发射功率设为最大值，然后，她将 双眼凑近光学定位系统的目镜，看到太阳正在升出地平线。她启动了天 线定位系统，缓缓转动方向杆使其对准太阳。巨型天线转动时产生的隆 隆震动传进主控室，有一名值班员又看了叶文洁一眼，但也没说什么。 太阳完全升出了天边连绵的山脊，红岸天线定位器的十字丝的中 心对在它的上缘，这是考虑了电波运行的提前量，发射系统已处于就绪 状态。发射按钮呈长方形，很像电脑键盘上的空格键，但是红色的。这 时，叶文洁的手指悬在它上面两厘米处。 地球往事 三体 205 人类文明的命运，就系于这纤细的两指之上。 毫不犹豫地，叶文洁按下了发射键。 “干什么？”一名值班员带着睡意问。 叶文洁冲他笑了笑，没有说话。随即按下另一个黄键中止了发射， 又转动方向杆改变了天线的指向，然后离开控制台向外走去。 那个值班员看看表，也该下班了，他拿起日志，想把叶文洁刚才启 动发射系统的操作记下来，这多少有些异常，但他看看一条记录纸带， 发现她只将发射系统启动了不到三秒钟，于是将日志扔回原位，打了个 哈欠，戴上军帽走了。正在飞向太阳的信息是： 到这里来吧，我将帮助你们获得这个世界，我的文明已无力解决自 己的问题，需要你们的力量来介入。 初升的太阳使叶文洁头晕目眩，出门后没有走出多远，她就昏倒在 草地上。 醒来后，她发现自己躺在医务室中，杨卫宁在床边关切地看着她， 像多年前在飞机上那样。医生让叶文洁以后注意休息，因为她怀孕了。,"2 3 R e d C o a s t V I The nex t eight years were amon g the most peaceful of Y e W enjie’ s life. The horror experienced during the Cultural Revolution gradually subsided, and she was finally able to relax a little. The Red Coast Project co mpleted its testing and breaking-in phases, settling down into routine opera tion. Fewer and few er technical problems remained, and both work and life became regular . In p eace, what had been supp ressed by anxiety and fear began to reawaken. Y e found that the real pain had just begun. Nightmarish memories, like embers coming b ack to life, burned more and more fiercely , searing her heart. For most pe ople, perhaps time would have gradually healed these wounds. After a ll, during the Cultural Revolution, many people s uf fered fates similar to hers, and compared to many of them, Y e was relatively fortunate. But Y e had the mental habits of a scientist, and she refused to for get. Rather , she looked with a rational gaze on t he madness and hatred that had harmed her . Y e’ s rati onal consideration of humanity’ s evil side began the day she read Silent Spring . As she grew closer to Y ang W eining, he was able to get her many classics of foreign-la nguage philosophy and history under the guise of gathering technical research materials. The bloody history of humanity shocked her , and the extraordinary insights of the p hilosophers also led her to understand the most fundamental and secret aspects of human nature.Indeed, even on top of Radar Peak, a place the world almost fo r got, the madness and irrationality of the human race were constantly on display . Y e saw that the forest below the peak continued to fall to the deranged logging by her former comrades. Patches of bare earth grew daily , as though those parts of the Greater Khingan Mountains had had their skin torn of f. When those pa tches gr ew into regions and then into a connected whole, the few surviving trees seemed rather abnormal. T o complete the slash-and-burn plan, fire s were lit on the bare fi elds, and Radar Peak became th e refuge for birds escaping the fiery inferno. As the fires raged, the sorrowful cries of birds with singed feathers at the base never ceased. The insa nity of the human race had reached its historical zenith. The Cold W a r was at its height. Nucl ear missiles capable of destroying the Earth ten t imes over c ould be launched at a moment’ s notice, spread out among the countless missile silos do tting two continents and hidden within ghostlike nucle ar -powered bal listic missile submarines patr olling deep under th e sea. A single Lafayette - or Y ankee-class submarine held enough warheads to destroy hundreds o f cities and kill hundreds of millions, but most people continued their lives as if nothing was wrong. As a n astrophysicist, Y e was strongly against nuclear weapons. She knew this was a power that sho uld belong only to the stars. She knew also that the universe had even more terrible forces: black holes, antimatter , and more. C ompared to those forces, a thermonuclear bomb was nothing but a tiny candle. If humans obtained mastery over one of those other forces, the world m ight be vaporized in a m oment. In the face of madness , rationality was powerless. * * * Four years after entering Red Coast Base, Y e and Y ang married. Y ang truly loved her . For love, he gave up his future. The fier cest stage of the Cultural Revolution was over , and the political climate had grown somewhat m ilder . Y ang wasn’ t persecuted, exactly , for his marriage. However , because he married a woman who had b een deemed to be a counter - revolutionary , h e was viewed as politically immature and lost his position as chief engineer . The only reason that he and his wife wereallowed to stay on the base as ordinary technicians was because the base could not do without their technical skills. Y e accepted Y ang’ s proposal mainly out of gratitude. If he hadn’ t brought her into this safe haven in her most perilous moment, she would probably no longer be alive. Y ang was a talented man, cultured and with good taste. She didn’ t find him unpleasant, but her heart was like ashes from which the flame of love could no longer be lit. As she pondered human nature, Y e was faced with an ultimate loss of purpose and sank into another spiritual crisis. She had once been an idealist who nee ded to give all her talen t to a great goal, but now she realized that all that she had done was meaningless, and the future could not have any meaningful purs uits, either . As this mental state persisted, she g radually felt more and more alienated from the world. She didn’ t belong. The sense of wandering in the spiritual wilder ness tormented her . After she made a home with Y ang, her soul became homeless. One nig ht, Y e was working the night shift. This was the lonelie st time. In the deep silence of midnight, the universe revealed itself to its listeners as a vast desola tion. What Y e disliked most was seeing the waves that slowly crawled across the displa y , a visual record of the meaningless noise Red Coa st pick ed up from spa ce. Y e felt this interminable w ave was an abstract view of the universe: one end connected to the endless past, the other to the end less future, and in the middle only the ups and downs of random chancewithout life, without pattern, the peaks and valleys at dif ferent heights like uneven g rains of sand, the whole curve like a one- dimensional desert made of all t he grains of sand lined up in a row , lonely , desolate, so long that it was into lerable. Y ou could follow it and go forward or backward as long as you liked, but you’d never find the end. On this day , however , Y e saw s omething odd when she glanced at the waveform displa y . Even experts had a hard time telling with th e naked eye whether a waveform carried inf ormation. But Y e was so familiar with the noise of the uni verse that she c ould tell that the wave that now moved in front of her eyes had something extra. The thin curve, rising and falling, seemed to possess a soul. She was certain that the radio signal before her had been modulated by intelligence. She rushed to another terminal a nd checked the computer ’ s rating of the signal’ s recogniz ability: AAAAA. Before this, no radio signal received byRed Coast ever garnered a rec ognizability rating above C. An A rating meant the likelihood that the transmission contained intelligent information was greater than 90 percent. A rating of AAAAA was a special, extreme case: It meant the received transmission used the exact same coding language as Red Coast’ s own outbound transmission. Y e turne d on the Red Coast deciphering system. The software at tempted to decip her any signal whose r ecognizability rating was above B. During the e ntire time that the Red Co ast Project had been running, it had never been invoked even once in real use. Based on test data, deciphering a transmission suspected of being a message might require a few days or even a f ew months of computing time , and the result would be failure more than half the time. B ut this time, a s soon as the file containing the original transmission was submitted, the display showed that the deciphering was complete. Y e opened the resulting document, and, for the first time, a human read a message from another world. The content was not what any one had imagined. It was a warning repeated three times. Do not answer! Do not answer!! Do not answer!!! Still cau ght up by the dizzying excitement and confusion, Y e de ciphered a second message. This world has received your message. I am a pacifist in thi s world. It is the luc k of your civilization that I am the first to receive your message. I am warning you: Do not answer! Do not answer!! Do not answer!!! There are tens of millions of stars in your direction. As long as you do not answer , this world will not be able to ascertain the source of your transmission. But i f you do answer , the source will be located right away . Y our planet will be invaded. Y our world will be conquered! Do not answer! Do not answer!! Do not answer!!!As she read the flashing green text on the display , Y e was no longer capable of thinking clearly . Her mind, inhibited by shock and excitement, could only understand this: No more than nine years had passed since the time sh e had sent the messa ge to the sun. Then the source of this transmission mu st be around fou r light-years away . It could only have come from the closest extra-solar stellar system: Alpha Centauri.34 The universe was not desolate. The universe was not empty . The universe was full of life! Huma nkind had cast their gaze to the end of the universe, but they had no idea th at intelligent life already existed around the stars closest to them! Y e stared at the waveform displ ay: The signal continued to strea m from the universe into the Red Coast antenna. She opened up another interface and began real-time decipher ing. The messages began to show up immediately on the screen. During the next four hours, Y e learned of the existence of T risolaris, learned of the civilization that had been reborn again and again, and learned of their plan to migrate to the stars. At four in the morning, the transmission from Alpha Centauri ended. The decipherin g system continued to run uselessly and emitted an unceasing string of failure codes. The Red Coast monitoring system was once again only hearing the noise of the universe. But Y e was certain that what she had just experienced was not a dream. The sun really w as an amplifying antenna. But why had her exp eriment eight years ago not received any echoes? Why had the waveforms of Jupiter ’ s radio outbursts not mat ched the later radiation from the sun? Later , Y e cam e up with many re asons. It was possible that the base communication of fice couldn’ t receive radio waves at that frequency , or maybe the of fice did receive the echo but it sounded like noise and so the operator though t it was nothing. As for the waveforms, it was p ossible that when the sun am plified the radio waves, it also added another wave to it. It would likely be a periodic wave that could be easily filtered out by the alien deciphering system, but to her unaided eye, the waveform from Jupiter and from the sun would appear very dif ferent. Y ears later , after Y e had left Red Coast, s he woul d manage to confirm her last guess: The sun had added a sine wave.She looked around alertly . There were three others in the main computer room. T w o of the three were chatting in a corner , while the last was napping before a terminal. In the data analysis section of the monitor ing system, only the two terminals in front of her could view the recognizability rating of a signal and access the deciphering system. Maintaining her composure, she worked quickly and moved all of the received messages to a multiply-encrypted, invisible subdirectory . Then she copied over a segment of noise received a year ago as a subst itute for the transmission received during the last five hours. Finally , from the terminal, she placed a short message into the Red Coast transmission buf fer . Y e got up and left the monitoring main control room. A chilly wind blew against her feverish face. Dawn had just brightened the eastern sky , and she followe d the dimly lit pebble-paved path to the transm ission main control room. Above her , the Red Coast antenna lay open, silently , like a giant pa lm towa rd the universe. The dawn turned the guard at the door into a silhouette, and as usual, he did not pay attention to Y e as she entered. The transmissio n main control room was much dimmer t han the monitoring main control room. Y e passed through rows of cabinets to stand in front of the control panel and flipped more than a dozen sw itches with practiced ease to warm up the transmission system. The two men on duty next to the control panel looked up at her with sleepy eyes, and one turned to glanc e at the clock. Then on e of them went back to his na p while the other flipped through a well-th umbed newspaper . At the base, Y e had no political status, but she did have some freedom in technical matters. She often tested the equipment befo re a transmission. Although she was early todaythe trans mission wasn’ t scheduled to occur until three h ours later warming up a bit early wasn’ t that unusual. What ha ppened next was the lo ngest half hour of her life. During this time, Y e adjusted the transmission frequency to the optimal frequency for amplification by the solar ener gy mirror , and increased the transmission power to maxim um. Then, putting her eyes to the eyepiece of the optical positioning system, she watched the sun rise above the horizon, activated the p ositioning system for the antenna, and slowly aligned it with the sun. As t he gigantic antenna turned, the rumbling noise shook the main control room. One of the men on duty looked at Y e again, but said nothing.The sun was no w completely above the horizon. The crossha ir of the Red Coast positioning system was aimed at its upper edge to account for the time it would ta ke for the radio wave to travel to the sun. The t ransmission system was ready . The T ransmit button was a long rectanglevery similar to the Space key on a computer keyboard, except that it was red. Y e’ s hand hovered two centimeters above it. The fate of the entire human race was now tied to these slender fingers. W ithout hesitation, Y e pressed the button. “What are you doing?” one of the men on duty asked, still sleepy . Y e smiled at him and said nothing. She pressed a yellow button to stop the trans mission. Then she moved the control stick until the antenna was pointed elsewhere. She left the control panel and walked away . The man looked at his watch. It was time to get of f work. He picked up the diary and th ought about recording Y e’ s operation of the t ransmission system. It was, a fter all, out of the ordinary . But then he looked at the paper tape and saw that she had transmitted for no more than three seconds. He tossed the diary back, yawned, put on his army cap, and left. The message that was winging its way to the sun said, Come he r e! I will help you conquer this world. Our civilization is no longer capable of solving its own pr oblems. W e need your for ce to intervene. The new ly risen sun dazzled Y e W enjie. Not too far from the door of the main control room, she collapsed onto the lawn in a faint. When she woke up, she found herself in the base clinic. Next to her bed sat Y ang, watching her with concern, like that time many years ago on the helicopter . The doctor told Y e to be careful and get plenty of rest. “Y ou are pregnant,” he said."
中国科幻基石丛书 206 25．叛 乱 叶文洁讲述完这段历史后，大厅陷入一片静默，在场的许多人显然 也是第一次听到这么完整的讲述，汪淼也被深深地吸引了，暂时忘记了 目前的危险和恐惧，不由问道： “那么，三体组织是如何发展到这个规模的呢？ ” 叶文洁回答： “这要从我认识伊文斯说起……不过， 这段历史在场 的同志们都知道，我们就不要在这上面浪费时间了，以后我可以单独为 你讲，但是否有这个机会，就要看你自己了……小汪，我们还是谈谈你 的纳米材料吧。 ” “你们所说的……主，为什么这样害怕纳米材料呢？ ”汪淼问。 “因为它能够使人类摆脱地球引力，大规模进入太空。 ” “太空电梯？ ”汪淼立刻想到了。 “是的，那种超高强度的材料一旦能够大规模生产，建设从地表直 达地球同步轨道的太空电梯就有了技术基础。对主而言，这只是一项很 小的发明，但对地球人类却意义重大。地球人类可以凭借这项技术轻易 地进入近地空间。在太空建立起大规模的防御体系便成为可能，所以， 必须扑灭这项技术。 ” “倒计时的终点是什么？”汪淼问出了这个令他恐惧的问题。 叶文洁微微一笑， “不知道。 ” “你们这样做没有意义！这不是基础研究，大方向对了别人也能做 出来的！ ”汪淼紧张地大声说。 “是没有意义，能够扰乱研究者的思想是最有效的，但我们做得不 地球往事 三体 207 理想，如你所说，这毕竟是应用研究，不像对基础研究那么有效……” “说到基础研究，你女儿是怎么死的？ ” 这问题令叶文洁沉默了几秒钟，汪淼注意到，她的眼神几乎不为 人察觉地黯淡了一下，但旋即接下了刚才的话题， “其实，对于无比强 大的主来说，我们做的一切都丝毫没有意义，我们只是做自己想做的 事。” 叶文洁话音刚落，轰然几声巨响，饭厅的两扇大门同时被撞开，一 群端冲锋枪的士兵冲了进来，汪淼注意到他们不是武警而是正规军，他 们几乎无声地贴墙而行，很快在三体叛军周围形成了一个包围圈。史强 最后走了进来，皮夹克敞着怀，手里握着枪管，枪柄像一把榔头似的露 出来。他大大咧咧地四下看看，突然冲向前去，倒握着枪的手一抡，响起 了金属砸在头骨上的闷响，一名三体战士倒了下去，没来得及抽出的手 枪摔出老远。几名士兵冲天鸣枪，天花板上落下一片尘土。有人拉起汪 淼，飞快地跑出了三体叛军的人群，站到一排士兵后面。 “武器都丢桌子上！谁再炸刺，穿了丫的！ ”史强指指身后的一排冲 锋枪说： “知道各位都是不要命的，我们也是冲不要命来的！我可把话 搁这儿了：普通的警务和法律禁区，对你们已经不适用，甚至人类的战 争法则对你们也不适用了！既然你们已经与全人类为敌，咱们大家也都 没什么可忌讳的。 ” 三体叛军的人群中有一阵骚动，但并没有大的惊慌。叶文洁不动声 色。有三个人突然冲出人群，其中包括扭断潘寒脖子的那个美丽女孩 儿，他们冲向那座活动的三体艺术品，一个人抓住了一颗翻飞的金属 球，紧紧抱在胸前。 美丽女孩双手托起晶亮的金属球，让人联想到身材苗条的艺术体 操运动员，她又露出那动人的笑，用悦耳的声音说： “各位警官，我们手 里拿着的是三枚原子弹，每枚当量一千五百吨级，不算大，我们喜欢小 玩艺儿，这是起爆开关。 ” 大厅的一切顿时凝固了，唯一在动的是史强。他把倒握的枪插回左 中国科幻基石丛书 地球 往事 三体 中国科幻基石丛书 210 腋下的枪套，神态自若地拍拍手。 “我们的要求很简单：让统帅走，然后咱们一起玩什么都行。 ”女孩 接着说，样子有些娇嗔。 “我和同志们在一起。 ”叶文洁平静地说。 “能证实她说的吗？”史强低声问旁边一位显然是爆炸物专家的军 官。 那位军官将一只塑料袋扔到那三个拿球的人跟前，袋中装着一把 弹簧秤。一名拿金属球的三体战士拾起塑料袋，取出弹簧秤后将球装 进袋子， 挂到弹簧秤上， 举起来晃了晃， 然后把球取出来扔到地上。 女孩儿 哈哈一笑，这边的爆炸物专家也轻蔑地笑笑。另一个拿球的人也照样称 了球，然后也将球扔了。女孩又笑了一声，接过塑料袋将球装了进去，挂 到弹簧秤上，标尺哗地一下直落到底。 爆炸物专家脸上的笑容凝固了，低声对史强说： “这个是了。 ” 史强仍不动声色。 “至少可以肯定里面装有重元素裂变材料，至于引爆系统行不行 还不清楚。 ”爆炸物专家说。 士兵们枪上电筒的光柱集中在那个拿核弹的女孩儿身上，这个艳 丽的死亡之花手捧着一千五百吨 TNT ，灿烂地笑着，仿佛是在舞台聚光 灯下迎接着掌声和赞美。 “有一个办法：向那个球射击。 ”爆炸物专家在大史耳边低声说。 “不会引爆？ ” “只会引爆外围的常规炸药，但会将炸药打散，无法对中心核炸药 产生精确向心压缩，肯定不会发生核爆炸。 ” 大史盯着核弹女孩儿，不说话。 “要布置狙击手吗？ ” 大史几乎不为人察觉地摇摇头， “没有合适位置， 那小东西精得能 捉鬼，狙击手的长家伙一瞄准她就会觉察。 ” 说完，大史径直向前走去，拨开人群，站到中间的空地上。 地球往事 三体 211 “站住。 ” 核弹女孩向大史抛了个媚眼警告道， 右手拇指紧按在起 爆开关上，指甲油在电筒光中闪亮着。 “悠着点儿丫头， 有件事儿你肯定想知道。 ” 大史站在距女孩七八 米远处，从衣袋中掏出一个信封， “你母亲找到了。 ” 女孩儿神采飞扬的眼睛立刻黯淡了下来，但这时，这双眼睛真的通 向她的心灵。 大史趁机又向前跨了两步，将自己与女孩的间距缩短至五米左右， 女孩警惕地一举核弹，用目光制止了他，但她的注意力已经被大大分散 了。刚才扔掉假核弹的两人中的一个向大史走来，伸手来拿他举着的信 封，大史闪电般抽出手枪，他抽枪的动作正好被取信的人挡住，女孩没 有看到，她只看到取信人的耳边亮光一闪，怀中的核弹就被击中爆炸 了。 一声沉闷的巨响后，汪淼两眼一黑什么都看不到了，他被人拉着拖 出食堂，黄色的浓烟从大门涌出，里面的喧闹声和枪声响成一片，不断 有人从浓烟中冲到外面……汪淼起身要冲回大厅，被那名爆炸物专家 拦腰抱住。 “当心！放射性！ ！ ” 混乱很快平息了，有十几名三体战士被击毙，其余包括叶文洁在内 的二百多人被捕。核弹女孩炸得血肉模糊，但这枚流产的核弹只炸死 她一人：大史面前的取信人被炸成重伤，由于有这人的遮挡，大史只受 了些轻伤，但他和爆炸后待在大厅中的其他人一样，受到了严重的放射 性沾染。 汪淼透过救护车的小窗看着车里的大史，他头上的一道伤口还在 流血，给他包扎的护士穿着透明的防护服，大史和汪淼只能用手机说 话。 “那个女孩是谁？ ”汪淼问。 大史咧嘴一笑， “我他妈的怎么知道，瞎猜的，这样的女孩子，多半 没见过妈。我干这行二十多年，就学会了看人。 ” 中国科幻基石丛书 212 “你赢了，真的是有人捣鬼。 ”汪淼努力地挤出笑来，希望车里大 史能看到。 “老弟，还是你赢了。 ”大史笑着摇摇头， “老子怎么会想到，奶奶 的，竟然真扯到外星人那儿！ ”,"2 4 R e b e l l i o n After Y e W enjie finished recounting the history of her first contact with T risolaris, the abandoned cafeteria remained silent. Many present were apparently just hearing the com plete story for the first time. W ang was deeply absorbed by the narrative and temporarily for got about the danger and terro r he faced. Unable to stop himself, he asked, “How did the ET O then develop to its present scale?” Y e replied, “I’d have to start with how I got to know Evans.… But every comrade here already knows tha t part of history , so we shouldn’ t waste time on i t now . I can tell you later . However , whether we’ll ha ve such an opportunity dep ends on you.… Xiao W ang, let’ s talk about your nanomaterial.” “This … Lord that you talk about. Why is it so afraid of nanomaterial?” “Because it can allow humans to escape gravity and engage in space construction at a much lar ger scale.” “The space elevator?” W ang suddenly understood. “Y es. If ultrastrong nanomateri als could be mass produced, then that would lay the technical foundation for building a space elevat or from the ground up to a geostationary po int in space. For our Lord, this is but a tiny invention; but for humans on Ea rth, its meaning would be significant. W ith this tech nology , humans could easily enter near -Earth space and build up lar ge-scale defensive structures. Thus, this technology must be extinguished.”“What i s at the end of the countdown?” W ang asked the question that frightened him the most. Y e smiled. “I don’ t know .” “But try ing to stop me is useless! This is not basic research. B ased on what we’ve already found out, someone else can figure ou t the rest.” W ang’ s voice was loud but anxious. “Y es, it is rat her useless. It’ s far more ef fective to conf use the researchers’ min ds. But, like yo u point out, we didn’ t stop the progress in time. After all, w hat you do is applied research. Our technique is far more ef fective against basic research.…” “Speaking of basic research, how did your daughter die?” The question silenced Y e for a few seconds. W ang noticed that her eyes dimmed almost imperceptibly . But she then resumed the conversation. “Indeed, compared to our Lord, who possesses peerless strength, everything we do is meaningless. W e’re just doing whatever we can.” Just as she finished speaking, several loud booms rang out and t he doors to the cafeteria broke open. A team of soldiers holding submachine guns rushed in. W ang realized that the y were not armed police, but the real army . Noiselessly they proceeded along the walls and soon surrounded the rebels of the ET O. Shi Qiang was the last to enter . His jacket was open, and he held the barrel of a pistol so that the grip was like the head of a hammer . Da S hi looked around arrogantly , then suddenly dashed forward. His hand flashed and there was the dull thud of metal striking against a skull. An ET O rebel f ell to the groun d, and the gun that he was trying to draw tumbled to fall some distance away . Several soldiers began to shoot at the ceiling, and dust and debris fell. Someone grabbed W ang Miao and pulled him away from the ET O ranks until he was safe behind a row of soldiers. “Drop all your weapons onto the table! I swear I’m going to kill the next son of a bitch who tries anything.” Da Shi pointed at the subm achine guns arrayed behind him. “I know that none of you is afraid to die, but we’re not afraid either . I’m going to say this up front: Normal police procedures and laws don ’ t apply to you. Even the human laws of warfare no lon ger apply to you. Sin ce you’ ve decided to t reat the entire human race as your enemy , there’ s no longer anything we wouldn’ t do to you.” There was some commotion among the ET O members, but no one panicked. Y e’ s face remained impassive. Three people suddenly rushed outof th e cr owd, inc luding the young woman who had twisted Pan Han’ s neck. They ran toward the three-body sculpture, and each grabbed one of the spheres and held it in front of his or her chest. The young woman raised the bright metal sphere before her with both hands, as though she were getting ready to start a gymnastics routine. Smiling, she said, “Of ficers, we hold in our hands three nuclear bombs, each with a yield of about one point five kilotons. Not too big, s ince we like small toys. This is the detonator .” Everyone in the cafeteria froz e. The only one who moved was Shi Qiang. He put his gun back into the holster under his left arm and placed his hands together calmly . “Our dem and is simple: Let the commander go,” the young woman said. “Then we can play whatever game you want.” Her tone suggested that she wasn’ t afraid of Shi Qiang and the soldiers at all. “I stay with my comrades,” Y e said, calmly . “Can you confirm her claim?” D a Shi asked an of ficer next to him, an explosives expert. The of fi cer threw a bag in front of the three ET O members holding the spheres. One of the ET O fighte rs picked up the bag and took out a spring scale, a bigger version of the one s some customers brought to str eet markets to ve rify the por tions measured by vendors. He placed his metal sphere into the bag, attached it to the spring scale, and held it aloft. The gau ge extended about halfway and stopped. The young woman chuckled. The explosives expert also laughed, contemptuously . The ET O member took out the sphere and tossed it on the ground. Another ET O fighter picked u p the scale and the bag and r epeated the procedure with his sphere, and ended up also tossing the sphere to the ground. The you ng woman laughed once more and picked up the bag herself. She loaded her sphere into the bag, hung it on the hook of the scale, and the gauge im mediately dropped to its bottom, the spring in the scale having been fully extended. The smile on th e explosives expert’ s face froze. He whispere d to Da Shi, “Damn! They really do have one.” Da Shi remained impassive.The explosives expert said, “W e can at least confirm that t here are heavy elementsfissile materialinside. W e don’ t know if the detonation mechanism works.” The flas hlights attached to the soldiers’ guns focused on the young woman holding the nuclear bom b. While she held the destructive power of 1.5 k ilotons of T NT in her han ds, she smiled brightly , as thou gh enjoying applause and praise on a spotlit stage. “I have an idea: Shoot the sphere,” the explosives expert whispered to Da Shi. “W on’ t that set of f the bomb?” “The co nventional explosives a round the outside will go of f, but the explosion will be scattered. It won’ t lead to the kind of precise compression of the fissile material in the center necessary for a nuclear explosion.” Da Shi stared at the nuclear woman, saying nothing. “How about snipers?” Almost imperce ptibly , Da Shi shook his head. “There’ s no good position. She’ s sharp as a tack. A s soon as she’ s tar geted by a sniper scope, she’ll know .” Da Shi strode forward. He pushed the crowd apart and stood in the middle of the empty space. “Stop,” the young woman warn ed Da Shi, staring at him intently . Her right thu mb was poised over the detonator . Her face was no longer smiling in the flashlight beams. “Calm down,” Da Shi said, standing about seven or eight meters from her . He took an envelope from h is pocket. “I have some inform ation you’ll definitely want to know . Y our mother has been found.” The young woman’ s feverish e yes dimmed. At that moment her eyes were truly windows to her soul. Da Shi took two steps forward. He was now no more than fiv e meters from her . She raised the bomb and warned him with her eyes, but she was already distracte d. One of the two ET O members who had tossed away fake bombs s trode to ward Da Shi to take the envelope from him. As the man blocked the woman’ s view of D a Shi, he drew his gun with a lightning-fast motion. The woman only saw a flash by the ear of the man try ing to take the letter from Da Shi before the bomb in her hands exploded.After hearing the muf fled explo sion, W ang saw nothing before his eyes but dark ness. Someone dragge d him out of the cafeteria. Thick, yellow smoke p oured o ut of the door , and a cacophony of shouting and gunshots came fro m insid e. From time to time, people rushed through the smoke and out of the cafeteria. W ang got up and tried to go ba ck into the cafeteria, but the explosives expert grabbed him around the waist and stopped him. “Careful. Radiation!” The cha os eventually subsided. More than a dozen ET O fighters were killed in the gu nfight. The restmore than two hundred, including Y e W enjiewere a rrested. The explosion had turned the nuclear woman into a bloody mess, but she was the o nly casualty of the aborted bomb. The man who had tried to take the letter from Da Shi was severely injure d, but since his body had s hielded Da Shi, his wounds were light. Ho wever , like everyone else who remained in the cafeteria after the explosion, Shi suf fered severe radiation contamination. Through the small window of an ambulance, W ang stared at Da Shi, who was lying inside. A wound on Da Shi’ s head continued to ooze blood. The nur se who was dressing th e wound wore transparent protective gear . Da Shi and W ang could only talk through their mobile phones. “Who was that young woman’ s mother?” W ang asked. Da Shi grinned. “Fucked if I know . Just a guess. A girl like th at most likely ha s mothe r issues. After doing this for more than twenty years, I’m pretty good at reading people.” “I bet you’re h appy to be proven right. There really was someone behind all this.” W ang forced himself to smile, hoping Da Shi could see it. “Buddy , you’re the one who was right!” Da Shi laughed, shaking his head. “I would never have tho ught that actual fucking aliens would be involved!”"
地球往事 三体 213 26．雷志成、 杨卫宁之死 审问者：姓名？ 叶文洁：叶文洁。 审问者：出生日期？ 叶文洁： 1947年6月。 审问者：职业？ 叶文洁：清华大学物理系天体物理专业教授， 2004年退休。 审问者：鉴于你的身体情况，谈话过程中你可以要求暂停休息。 叶文洁：谢谢，不用。 审问者：我们今天进行的是普通刑事案件的调查，不涉及更高层次 的内容，这不是本次调查的主要部分，我们希望快些结束，希望你能配 合。 叶文洁：我知道你指的是什么，我会配合的。 审问者：调查发现，在红岸基地工作期间，你有杀人嫌疑。 叶文洁：我杀死过两个人。 审问者：时间？ 叶文洁： 1979年10月21日下午。 审问者：受害者的姓名？ 叶文洁：基地政委雷志成和基地工程师、我的丈夫杨卫宁。 审问者：讲述一下你作案的动机。 叶文洁：我……是不是能假设你对当时相关的背景有所了解？ 审问者：基本了解，不清楚的我会提问。 中国科幻基石丛书 214 叶文洁：好的。在接收到外星信息并回信后的当天，我得知收到该 信息的不止我一个人，雷志成也收到了。雷政委是那个年代典型的政治 干部，政治神经很敏感，用当时的话说，就是阶级斗争这根弦绷得很紧。 他背着红岸基地的大部分技术人员，在主计算机中长期后台运行着一 个小程序，这个程序不断读取发射和接收的信息缓冲区，并将读到的内 容存贮在一个隐藏很深的加密文件中，这样，红岸系统发射出去和接收 到的信息就有了一个只有他能读取的备份，正是从这个备份中，他发现 了红岸接收到的外星文明信息。在我向初升的太阳发出回答信息的当 天下午，也就是我从医务室中刚得知自己怀孕后，雷志成把我叫到他的 办公室。我看到，他办公桌上的终端屏幕上赫然显示着昨夜收到的来自 三体世界的信息…… “从接收到第一批信息到现在，已经过去了八个多小时，你没有报 告，反而将原始信息删除或隐藏起来了，是吗？ ” 我低着头没有回答。 “你下一步的企图我也清楚，你打算回电。如果不是我发现得及 时，整个人类文明都将毁在你手中！当然，这不是说我们惧怕来自宇宙 的入侵，退一万步说，那种事真的发生了，外星侵略者必然会淹没于人 民战争的汪洋大海之中！ ” 我现在明白了，他还不知道我已经发出了回电，我将回答信息放入 发射缓冲区时，使用的不是常规文件接口，这无意中绕开了他的监视程 序。 “叶文洁，你是会做出这种事的，对于党和人民，你一直怀有刻骨 的仇恨，不会放过任何一个报复的机会。你知道这样做的后果吗？ ” 我当然知道，于是点点头，雷志成沉默片刻，下面的话却出乎我的 预料。 “叶文洁，对于你，我是不会有任何恻隐之心的，你一直都是一个 与人民为敌的阶级敌人。但我与杨卫宁是多年的战友，我不能看着他和 地球往事 三体 215 你一同彻底毁掉，更不能看着他的孩子也跟着毁掉，你有孩子了，不是 吗？ ” 他这话并非随便说说，如果事发，在那个年代，这样性质的问题，不 管我丈夫与此事有无关系，都会受到很大牵连，当然还有未出世的孩 子。 雷志成压低了声音说： “目前，这件事情还只有我们俩知道，现在 要做的，就是把这件事情的影响降到最小，你什么都不要管，就当这件 事没有发生，不要向任何人提起，包括杨卫宁，剩下的事情，就由我来处 理吧。小叶啊，请相信我，只要你配合，就能避免可怕的后果。 ” 我立刻明白了雷志成的用心：他想成为第一个发现外星文明的人， 这确实是一个名垂青史的绝好机会。 我答应了他，然后离开了办公室，这时我已经决定了一切。 我拿了一个小扳手，走进了接收系统前端处理模块的设备间，打开 主机柜，将最下方的接地线的螺栓小心地拧松了，由于我时常需要检查 设备， 所以谁也没有注意到我干了什么。 这时， 接地电阻由 0.6欧姆一下 子上升到 5欧姆，接收系统的干扰骤然增大。 值班技术员立刻就知道是接地线故障，因为这种故障以前多次发 生，判断起来很容易，但他不会想到是接地线顶端的故障，因为那里固 结很好，一般没人动，况且我说刚顺便看过了。雷达峰的顶部是一种 很不寻常的地质结构，覆盖着一层厚十几米的胶泥，这种胶泥层导电性 很差。接地线埋下后，接地电阻总是达不到要求；把接地电极深埋也不 行，因为这种胶泥层对导线有很强的腐蚀作用，时间长了可能从中部将 接地线蚀断。 最后只好将接地线排从那道悬崖上垂下去， 沿着崖壁一直 垂到没有胶泥层的地方，将接地电极埋设在崖壁上的那个位置，即使这 样接地仍然不稳定，电阻常常超标，问题都出在接地线在悬崖壁上的 部分，这时维修人员就要用绳索吊下去修。那名技术员就向外围维修班 打招呼，班里的一名战士在一根铁柱上系好绳索就顺着崖壁下去了，在 下面折腾了半个多小时，满头大汗地上来，说找不到故障。这次监听作 中国科幻基石丛书 216 业眼看就要受到影响，只好上报基地指挥部。我就在悬崖顶上那个系绳 索的铁柱旁等着，事情果然如我预料，雷志成跟着那名战士来了。 应该说，雷志成是一名很敬业的政工干部，忠实地按照那时对他们 的要求去做：与群众打一片，时时站在第一线，也许是为了做姿态，但 他的确做得很好，基地急难险重的工作中都少不了他的身影，而以往 他干得最多的，就是抢修接地线这个既危险又累的活。这工作虽然没 有多高的技术含量，但需要经验，因为故障可能是因接地线暴露露天产 生的难以察觉的接触不良，也可能是因为接地电极埋设处因干燥等原 因导致的导电性差，现在负责外围维修的这批志愿兵刚刚调换过，都没 有经验，所以我估计他多半要来。他系好安全带，就顺着绳索下去了，好 像我不存在似的。我借口把那名战士支走了，悬崖顶上只剩下我一人， 然后我从衣袋中掏出了一件东西，那是一叠短钢锯，是一条长锯条折成 三段后叠在一起的，这样绳索的断口看不出是锯断的。 正在这时我丈夫杨卫宁来了。 问清事情的原由后，他向悬崖下看了看，说要是检查接地电极的话 需要开挖，老雷一个人在下面太费劲。他要下去帮忙，于是系上那名战 士留下的安全带。我说再拿一条绳索吧，他说不用，这条绳子就挺粗挺 结实，承带两个人没问题。我坚持要拿，他说那你去吧。等我急跑着取回 了另一条绳索回到悬崖顶时，他早顺着那条绳索下去了。我探头向下 看，见他和雷志成已经检查完毕，正沿着同一条绳索向上爬，雷志成在 前。 真的不会再有机会了，我掏出那叠钢锯，锯断了绳索。 审问者：我问一句，回答不记录。你当时的感受？ 叶文洁：冷静、毫不动感情地做了。我找到了能够为之献身的事业， 付出的代价，不管是自己的还是别人的，都不在乎。同时我也知道，全人 类都将为这个事业付出史无前例的巨大牺牲，这仅仅是一个微不足道 的开始。 地球往事 三体 217 审问者：好的，继续吧。 叶文洁：我听到两三声短促的惊叫，然后是身体摔到崖底乱石上的 声音，等了一会儿，我看到从崖底流出的那条小溪变红了……关于这件 事，我能说的就这些了。 审问者：好的，这是记录，请你仔细看看，准确无误的话，请在这 儿签字。,"2 5 T h e D e a t h s o f L e i Z h i c h e n g a n d Y a n g W e i n i n g INTERROGA T OR: Name?

YE: I know what you’re referring to. Y es, I’ll cooperate. INTERROGA T OR: O ur investigation revealed that while you were working at Red Coast Base, you were suspected of murder . YE: I did kill two people. INTERROGA T OR: When? YE: The afternoon of October 21, 1979. INTERROGA T OR: Names of the victims? YE: Base Commissar Lei Zhicheng, and my husband, Base Engineer Y ang W eining. INTERROGA T OR: Explain your motive for murder .YE: Can I … assume that you understand the relevant background? INTERROGA T OR: I know the basics. If something is unclear I’ll ask you. YE: Go od. On the day when I received the extraterrestrial commu nication and replied, I learned that I wasn’ t the only one to get the message. Lei did as well. * * * Lei was a typica l political cadre of the time, so he possessed an extremely keen sense for politics and saw everything through an ideological lens. Unbeknownst to most of the technical staf f at Red Coast Base, he ran a small pr ogram in the background on the main computer . This program constantly read from the transmission and reception buf fers and stored the results in a hid den encrypted file. This way , there would be a copy of everything Red Coast sent and r eceived that only he could read. It was from this copy that he discovered the extraterrestrial message. On the afternoo n after I sent my message toward the rising sun, and shortly after I learned that I was pregnant at the base clinic, Lei called me to his o f fice, and I saw that his term inal displayed the message from T risolaris that I had received the night before.… * * * “Eight hours have passed since you received the first message . Instead of making a report, you deleted the original message and maybe hid a copy . Isn’ t that right?” I kept my head down and did not reply . “I know your next move. Y ou pl an to reply . If I hadn’ t discovered this in time, you could have ruined a ll human civilization! Of course I’m not saying that we’re afraid of an interstellar invasion. Even if we assumed the worst and that really did happen, the outer space invaders would surely drown in the ocean of the people’ s righteous war!” I rea lized then that he didn’ t k now that I’d already replied. When I placed t he answ er into the trans mission buf fer , I didn’ t use the regular file interface. Luckily , this got around his monitoring program. “Y e W enjie, I knew you were capable of something like this. Y ou’ve always held a de ep hatred toward the Party and the people. Y ou would seizeany opportunity for revenge. Do you know the consequences of your actions?” Of course I knew , so I nodded. Lei was silent for a moment. But what he said nex t was unexpected. “Y e W enjie, I have no pity for you at all. Y ou’ve always b een a class enemy who views the people as your adve rsaries. But I’ve served many years with Y a ng. I cannot bear to see him ruined along with you, and I certainly cannot allow his child to be ruined as well. Y ou’re pregnant, aren’ t you?” What he said wasn’ t idle specul ation. During that era, my deed s would certainly have implicated my husband if revealed, regardless of whether he had anything to do with them. Lei kept his voice very low . “Right now , only you and I kno w what happened. What we must do is to minimize the impact of your actions. Pretend that it never happened and never mention it to anyone, including Y ang. I’ll take c are of the rest. As long as you cooperate, you can avoid the disastrous consequences.” I im mediately knew what Lei was after . He wanted to become the first man to discover extraterrestr ial intelligence. It really was a great opportunity to get his name into the history textbooks. I assented. Then I left his of fice. I’d already decided everything. I took a small wrench and went to the equipment closet for the processing module of the receiver . Because I often needed to inspect the equipment, no one paid attention. I opened the main cabinet and carefully loosened the bolt that secured the ground wire to the bottom. The interference on the receiver sud denly increased and the ground resistance went up from 0.6 ohms to 5 ohm s. The technician on duty thou ght it was a problem with the ground wire, because that kind of malfunction happened a lot. It was an eas y diagnosis. He would never have guessed that the problem was at this end, at the top of the ground wire, because this end was securely fastened, out of the way , and I told him that I had just inspected it. The top of Radar Peak had an un usual geological feature: a layer of clay more tha n a dozen meters thickpoor conductivitycovered i t. When the ground wire wasn’ t buried dee ply , ground resistance was invariably too high. However , the ground wire couldn’ t be sunk too deep, either , because the clay layer h ad a strong corrosive ef fect, and after a while, it would corrode the middle section of th e ground wire. In the end, the only solutionwas to drape the ground wire over the lip of the clif f until the tip was below the clay layer , and then bury the ground terminal into the clif f at that point. Even so , the grounding wasn’ t very stable, and the resistance was often excessive. Whenever such problems occurred, the trouble always involved the p art of the wire going into t he clif f. Whoever was assigned to repair it would have to go over the edge of the clif f, dangling on ropes. The technician on duty informe d the maintenance squad of th e issue. One of the soldiers in the squad tied a rope to an iron post and then rappelled down the clif f. After half an hour down below , he cl imbed back up, soaked in sweat, saying that he couldn’ t find the malfunction. It seemed that the next monitoring session would have to be delayed. There was no choice but to inf orm the Base C ommand Center . I waited by the iron post at the top of the c lif f. V ery soon, just as I had planned, Lei Zhicheng came back with that soldier . T o b e ho nest, L ei was very ded icated to his job and faithfully followed the d emands placed on political of ficers during that era: Becom e a part of the m asses and always be on th e front line. Maybe it was all fo r show , but he r eally was a good performe r . Whenever there was some d if ficult and perilous work at the base, he wa s sure to volunteer . One of the t asks that he performed more than anyone els e was to repair the ground wire, a task both dangerous and tiring. Even thou gh this job wasn’ t particularly demanding technically , it did benefit from experience. There were many causes of malfunction: a loose contact due to exposure to open airdif fic ult to detect or pos sibly th e location where the ground wire went into the clif f was too dry . The volunteer soldiers responsible for external maintenance were all new , and none had much experi ence. So I had guessed that Lei would most likely show up. He p ut o n the safety harness and went over the clif f edge on the rope, as though I didn’ t exist. I made some excuse to get rid of the soldier who brought him so that I was the on ly one left on the clif f. Then I took a short hacksaw out of my pocket. It was made from a longer saw b lade broken into three pieces and then stacked together . W ith the stacked blades, any cut I made would be particularly ragged, and it would not be obvious later that the rope was cut through with a tool. Just then, my husband, Y ang W eining, showed up.After I explaine d to him what had happened, he looked over the clif f edge. Then he said that to inspect the ground terminal in the clif f face required digging, and the work would be too much for just Lei. He wanted to go down to help, so he put on the safety harness left by that other soldier . I ask ed him to use another rope, but he said nothe rope that Lei was on was thick and sturdy and could easily bear the weight of two. I insisted, so he told me to go get the rope. By the time I rushed back to the clif f with the rope, he had already gone dow n over the side. I poked my he ad over the edge and saw that he and Lei ha d already finished their inspection and were climbing back up. Lei was in the front. There w ould ne ver be another c hance. I took out my hacksaw and cut through the rope. * * * INTERROGA T OR: I wa nt t o ask a question, but I won’ t record the answer . How did you feel at the time? YE: C alm. I did it without feeling anything. I had finally found a goal to which I could devote myself. I didn’ t care what price had to be paid, either by me or by others. I also knew that the entire human race would pay an unpreced ented price for this goal. This was a very insignificant beginning. INTERROGA T OR: All right. Continue. YE: I heard two or three surprised cries, and then the sound o f bodies slamming against the rocks at the clif f bottom. After a while, I saw that the strea m at the foot of the clif f had turned red.… That’ s all I’ll say about that. INTERROGA T OR: I understand. This is the re cord. Please check it over carefully . If there are no errors, please sign it."
中国科幻基石丛书 218 27．无人忏悔 雷志成和杨卫宁遇难后，上级很快以普通工作事故处理了这件事， 在基地所有人眼中，叶文洁和杨卫宁感情很好，谁也没有对她起疑心。 新来的基地政委很快上任，生活又恢复了以往的宁静，叶文洁腹中 的小生命一天天长大，同时，她也感到了外部世界的变化。 这天，警卫排排长叫叶文洁到门岗去一趟。她走进岗亭，吃了一惊： 这里有三个孩子，两男一女，十五六岁的样子，都穿着旧棉袄，戴着狗皮 帽，一看就是当地人。哨兵告诉她，他们是齐家屯的，听说雷达峰上都是 有学问的人，就想来问几个学习上的问题。叶文洁暗想，他们怎么敢上 雷达峰？这里是绝对的军事禁区，岗哨对擅自接近者只需警告一次就可 以开枪。哨兵看出了叶文洁的疑惑，告诉她刚接到命令，红岸基地的保 密级别降低了，当地人只要不进入基地，就可以上雷达峰来，昨天已经 来过几个当地农民，是来送菜的。 一个孩子拿出一本已经翻得很破旧的初中物理课本，他的手黑乎乎 的，像树皮一般满是皲裂，他用浓重的东北口音问了一个中学物理的 问题：课本上说自由落体开始一直加速，但最后总会以匀速下落，他们 想了几个晚上，都想不明白。 “你们跑这么远，就为问这个？”叶文洁问。 “叶老师，您不知道吗？外头高考了！ ”那女孩儿兴高采烈地说。 “高考？ ” “就是上大学呀！谁学习好，谁考的分高谁就能上！一年前就是了， 您还不知道？ ！ ” 地球往事 三体 219 “不推荐了？ ” “不了，谁都可以考，连村里‘黑五类’的娃都行呢！ ” 叶文洁愣了半天，这个变化很让她感慨。过了好一会儿，她才发现 面前捧着书的孩子们还等着，忙赶紧回答他们的问题，告诉他们那是由 于空气阻力与重力平衡的缘故；同时还许诺，如果以后有学习上的困 难，可以随时来找她。 三天后，又有七个孩子来找叶文洁，除了上次来过的三个外，其他 四个都是从更远的村镇来的。第三次来找她的孩子是十五个，同来的还 有一位镇中学的老师，由于缺人，他物理、数学和化学都教，他来向叶文 洁请教一些教学上的问题。这人已年过半百，满脸风霜，在叶文洁面前 手忙脚乱，书什么的倒了一地。走出岗亭后，叶文洁听到他对学生们说： “娃娃们，科学家，这可是正儿八经的科学家啊！ ”以后隔三差五地就有 孩子来请教，有时来的人很多，岗亭里站不下，经过基地负责安全警卫 的领导同意，由哨兵带着他们到食堂的饭厅里，叶文洁就在那儿支起一 块小黑板给孩子们讲课。 1978 年的除夕夜，叶文洁下班后天已经完全黑了，基地的人大部分 已在三天假期中下了山，到处都是一片寂静。叶文洁回到自己的房间， 这里曾是她和杨卫宁的家，现在空荡荡的，只有腹中的孩子陪伴着她。 外面的寒夜中，大兴安岭的寒风呼啸着，风中隐隐传来远处齐家屯的鞭 炮声。孤寂像一只巨掌压着叶文洁，她觉得自己被越压越小，最后缩到 这个世界看不到的一个小角落去了……就在这时，响起了敲门声，开门 后叶文洁首先看到哨兵，他身后有几支松明子的火光在寒风中摇曳着， 举火把的是一群孩子，他们脸冻得通红，狗皮帽上有冰碴子，进屋后带 着一股寒气。有两个男孩子冻得最厉害，他们穿得很单薄，却用两件厚 棉衣裹着一个什么东西抱在怀里，把棉衣打开来，是一个大瓷盆，里面 的酸菜猪肉馅饺子还冒着热气。 那一年，在向太阳发出信号八个月后，叶文洁临产了，由于胎位不 中国科幻基石丛书 220 正，她的身体又很弱，基地卫生所没有条件接生，就把她送到了最近的 镇医院。 这竟是叶文洁的一个鬼门关，她遇到了难产，在剧痛和大出血后陷 入昏迷，冥冥中只看到三个灼热刺眼的太阳围绕着她缓缓转动，残酷地 炙烤着她。这情景持续了很长时间后，她在朦胧中想到，这可能就是她 永恒的归宿了，这就是她的地狱，三个太阳构成的地狱之火将永远灼烧 着她，这是她因那个超级背叛受到的惩罚。她陷入强烈的恐惧中，不是 为自己，而是为孩子孩子还在腹中吗？还是随着她来到这地狱中蒙 受永恒的痛苦？不知过了多久，三个太阳渐渐后退了，退到一定距离后 突然缩小，变成了晶莹的飞星，周围凉爽了，疼痛也在减轻，她终于醒了 过来。 叶文洁听到耳边的一声啼哭，她吃力地转过脸，看到了婴儿粉嘟 嘟、湿乎乎的小脸儿。 医生告诉叶文洁，她出血达两千多毫升，齐家屯的几十位农民来给 她献血，他们中很多人的孩子她都辅导过，但更多的是素昧平生，只是 听孩子和他们的父母说起过她，要不是他们的话，她死定了。 以后的日子成了问题，叶文洁产后虚弱，在基地自己带孩子是不可 能的，她又无亲无故。这时，齐家屯的一对老两口来找基地领导，说他们 可以把叶文洁和孩子带回家去照顾。男的原来是个猎户，也采些药材， 后来周围的林子越来越少，就种地了，但人们还是叫他齐猎头儿。他们 有两儿两女，女孩都嫁出去了，一个儿子在外地当兵，另一个成家后与 他们一起过，儿媳妇也是刚生了娃。叶文洁这时还没有平反，基地领导 很是为难，但也只有这一个办法了，就让他们用雪橇把叶文洁从镇医院 接回了家。 叶文洁在这个大兴安岭的农家住了半年多，她产后虚弱，没有奶 水，这期间，杨冬吃着百家奶长大了。喂她最多的是齐猎头儿的儿媳妇， 叫大凤，这个健壮的东北妮子，每天吃着高粱米大渣子，同时奶两个娃， 奶水还是旺旺的。屯子里其他处于哺乳期的媳妇们也都来喂杨冬，她们 地球往事 三体 221 很喜欢她，说这娃儿有她妈的灵气儿。渐渐地，齐猎头儿家成了屯里女 人们的聚集地，老的少的，出嫁了的和大闺女，没事儿都爱向这儿跑，她 们对叶文洁充满了羡慕和好奇，她也发现自己与她们有很多女人间的 话可谈。记不清有多少个晴朗的日子，叶文洁抱着杨冬同屯子里的女人 们坐在白桦树柱围成的院子里，旁边有玩耍的孩子和懒洋洋的大黑狗， 温暖的阳光拥抱着这一切。她每次都特别注意看那几个举着铜烟袋锅 儿的，她们嘴里悠然吐出的烟浸满了阳光，同她们那丰满肌肤上的汗毛 一样，发出银亮的柔光。有一次她们中的一位将长长的白钢烟锅递给 她，让她“解解乏” ，她只抽了两口，就被冲得头晕脑涨，让她们笑了好 几天。 同男人们叶文洁倒是没什么话说，他们每天关心的事儿她也听不 太明白，大意是想趁着政策松下来种些人参，但又不太敢干。他们对叶 文洁都很敬重，在她面前彬彬有礼。她最初对此没有在意，但日子长了 后，当她看到那些汉子如何粗暴地打老婆，如何同屯里的寡妇打情骂俏 时，说出那些让她听半句都脸红的话，才感到这种敬重的珍贵。隔三差 五，他们总有人把打到的野兔山鸡什么的送到齐猎头儿家，还给杨冬带 来许多自己做的奇特而古朴的玩具。 在叶文洁的记忆中，这段日子不像是属于自己的，仿佛是某片从别 的人生中飘落的片断，像一片羽毛般飞入自己的生活。这段记忆被浓缩 成一幅幅欧洲古典油画，很奇怪，不是中国画，就是油画，中国画上空白 太多，但齐家屯的生活是没有空白的，像古典的油画那样，充满着浓郁 得化不开的色彩。一切都是浓烈和温热的：铺着厚厚乌拉草的火坑、铜 烟锅里的关东烟和莫合烟、厚实的高粱饭、六十五度的高粱酒……但这 一切，又都在宁静与平和中流逝着，像屯子边上的小溪一样。 最令叶文洁难忘的是那些夜晚。齐猎头儿的儿子到城里卖蘑菇去 了，他是屯里第一个外出挣钱的人，她就和大凤住在一起。这时齐家屯 还没通电，每天晚上，她们俩守在一盏油灯旁，叶文洁看书，大凤做针线 活。叶文洁总是不自觉地将书和眼睛凑近油灯，常常刘海被烤得吱啦一 中国科幻基石丛书 222 下，这时她俩就抬头相视而笑。大凤从来没出过这事儿，她的眼神极好， 借着炭火的光也能干细活儿。两个不到半周岁的孩子睡在她身边的炕 上，他们的睡相令人陶醉，屋里能听到的，只有他们均匀的呼吸声。叶文 洁最初睡不惯火炕，总是上火，后来习惯了，睡梦中，她常常感觉自己变 成了婴儿，躺在一个人温暖的怀抱里，这感觉是那么真切，她几次醒后 都泪流满面但那个人不是父亲和母亲，也不是死去的丈夫，她不知 道是谁。 有一次，她放下书，看到大凤把纳着的鞋底放到膝上，呆呆地看着 灯花。发现叶文洁在看自己，大凤突然问： “姐，你说天上的星星咋的就不会掉下来呢？ ” 叶文洁细看大凤，油灯是一位卓越的画家，创作了这幅凝重色调中 又带着明快的古典油画：大凤披着棉袄，红肚兜和一条圆润的胳膊露出 来，油灯突出了她的形象，在她最美的部位涂上了最醒目的色彩，将其 余部分高明地隐没于黑暗中。背景也隐去了，一切都淹没于一片柔和的 黑暗中，但细看还是能看到一片暗红的光晕，这光晕不是来自油灯，而 是地上的炭火照出来的，可以看到，外面的严寒已开始用屋里温暖的湿 汽在窗户上雕出美丽的冰纹了。 “你害怕星星掉下来吗？ ”叶文洁轻轻地问。 大凤笑着摇摇头： “怕啥呢？它们那么小。 ” 叶文洁终于还是没有做出一个天体物理学家的回答，她只是说： “它 们都很远很远，掉不下来的。 ” 大凤对这回答已经很满意，又埋头做起针线活儿来。但叶文洁却心 绪起伏，她放下书，躺到温暖的炕面上，微闭着双眼，在想象中隐去这间 小屋周围的整个宇宙，就像油灯将小屋中的大部分隐没于黑暗中一样。 然后，她将大凤心中的宇宙置换过来。这时，夜空是一个黑色的巨大球 面，大小正好把世界扣在其中，球面上镶着无数的星星，晶莹地发着银 光，每个都不比床边旧木桌上的那面圆镜子大。世界是平的，向各个方 向延伸到很远很远，但总是有边的。这个大平面上布满了大兴安岭这样 地球往事 三体 223 的山脉，也布满了森林，林间点缀着一个个像齐家屯一样的村庄……这 个玩具盒般的宇宙令她感到分外舒适，渐渐地这宇宙由想象变成了梦 乡。 在这个大兴安岭深处的小山村里，叶文洁心中的什么东西渐渐融 化了，在她心灵的冰原上，融出了小小的一汪清澈的湖泊。 杨冬出生后，在红岸基地，时间在紧张和平静中又过去了两年多。 这时，叶文洁接到了通知，她和父亲的案件都被彻底平反；不久之后又 收到了母校的信，说她可以立刻回去工作。与信同来的还有一大笔汇 款，这是父亲落实政策后补发的工资。在基地会议上，领导终于称她为 叶文洁同志了。 叶文洁很平静地面对这一切，没有激动和兴奋。她对外面的世界不 感兴趣，宁愿一直在僻静的红岸基地待下去，但为了孩子的教育，她还 是离开了本以为要度过一生的红岸基地，返回了母校。 走出深山，叶文洁充满了春天的感觉， “文革”的严冬确实结束了， 一切都在复苏之中。虽然浩劫刚刚结束，举目望去一片废墟，无数人在 默默地舔着自己的伤口，但在人们眼中，未来新生活的曙光已经显现。 大学中出现了带着孩子的学生，书店中文学名著被抢购一空，工厂中的 技术革新成了一件最了不起的事情，科学研究更是被罩上了一层神圣 的光环。科学和技术一时成了打开未来之门的唯一钥匙，人们像小学生 那样真诚地接近科学，他们的奋斗虽是天真的，但也是脚踏实地的。在 第一次全国科学大会上，郭沫若宣布科学的春天到来了。 这是疯狂的终结吗？科学和理智开始回归了？叶文洁不止一次地问 自己。 直到离开红岸基地，叶文洁再也没有收到来自三体世界的消息。她 知道，要想收到那个世界对她那条信息的回答，最少要等八年，何况她 离开了基地后，已经不具备接收外星回信的条件了。 那件事实在太重大了，却由她一个人静悄悄地做完，这就产生了一 中国科幻基石丛书 224 种不真实的感觉。随着时间的流逝，这种虚幻感越来越强烈，那件事越 来越像自己的幻觉，像一场梦。太阳真的能够放大电波吗？她真的把太 阳作为天线，向宇宙中发射过人类文明的信息吗？真的收到过外星文明 的信息吗？她背叛整个人类文明的那个血色清晨真的存在过？还有那一 次谋杀…… 叶文洁试着在工作中麻木自己，以便忘掉过去她竟然几乎成功 了，一种奇怪的自我保护本能使她不再回忆往事，不再想起她与外星 文明曾经有过的联系，日子就这样在平静中一天天过去。 回到母校一段时间后，叶文洁带着冬冬去了母亲绍琳那里。丈夫惨 死后，绍琳很快从精神错乱中恢复过来，继续在政治夹缝中求生存。她 紧跟形势高喊口号，终于得到了一点报偿，在后来的“复课闹革命”中 重新走上了讲台。但这时，绍琳却做出了一件出人意料的事，与一位受 迫害的教育部高干结了婚，当时那名高干还在干校住“牛棚”劳改中。 对此绍琳有自己的深思熟虑，她心里清楚，社会上的混乱不可能长久， 目前这帮夺权的年轻造反派根本没有管理国家的经验，现在靠边站和 受迫害的这批老干部迟早还是要上台执政的。后来的事实证明她这次 赌博是正确的， “文革”还没有结束，她的丈夫已经部分恢复了职位，十 一届三中全会后，他迅速升到了副部级。绍琳凭着这个背景，在这知识 分子重新得到礼遇的时候，很快青云直上。在成为科学院学部委员之 后，她很聪明地调离了原来的学校，很快升为另一所名牌大学的副校 长。 叶文洁见到的母亲，是一位保养得很好的知识女性形象，丝毫没有 过去受磨难的痕迹。她热情地接待了叶文洁母女，关切地询问她这些年 是怎么过来的，惊叹冬冬是多么的聪明可爱，细致入微地对做饭的保姆 交待叶文洁喜欢吃的菜……这一切都做得那么得体，那么熟练，那么恰 到好处。但叶文洁清楚地感觉到她们之间的隔阂，她们小心地避开敏感 的话题，没有谈到叶文洁的父亲。 地球往事 三体 225 晚饭后，绍琳和丈夫送叶文洁和孩子走了很远，副部长说要和叶文 洁说句话，绍琳就先回去了。这时，副部长的脸色一瞬间由温暖的微笑 变得冷若冰霜，像不耐烦地扯下一副面具，他说： “以后欢迎你带孩子常来，但有一条，不要来追究历史旧账。对于 你父亲的死，你母亲没有责任，她也是受害者。倒是你父亲这个人，对自 己那些信念的执着有些变态了，一条道走到黑，抛弃了对家庭的责任， 让你们母女受了这么多的苦。 ” “您没资格谈我的父亲， ”叶文洁气愤地说， “这是我和母亲间的 事，与别人无关。 ” “确实与我无关， ”绍琳的丈夫冷冷地点点头， “我是在转达你母 亲的意思。 ” 叶文洁回头看，在那座带院子的高干小楼上，绍琳正撩开窗帘的一 角向这边偷窥。叶文洁无言地抱起冬冬走了，以后再也没有回来过。 叶文洁多方查访当年打死父亲的那四个红卫兵，居然查到了她们 中的三个。这三个人都是返城知青，现在她们都没有工作。叶文洁得知 她们的地址后，分别给她们写了一封简单的信，约她们到当年父亲遇害 的操场上谈谈。 叶文洁并没有什么复仇的打算。在红岸基地的那个旭日初升的早 晨，她已向包括她们在内的全人类复了仇，她只想听到这些凶手的忏 悔，看到哪怕是一点点人性的复归。 这天下午下课后，叶文洁在操场上等着她们。她并没有抱多大希 望，几乎肯定她们是不会来的，但在约定的时间，三个老红卫兵来了。 叶文洁远远就认出了那三个人，因为她们都穿着现在已经很少见 的绿军装。走近后，她发现这很可能就是她们当年在批判会上穿的那身 衣服，衣服都已洗得发白，有显眼的补丁。但除此以外，这三个三十左右 的女人与当年那三名英姿飒爽的红卫兵已没有任何相似之处了，从她 们身上消逝的，除了青春，显然还有更多的东西。 中国科幻基石丛书 226 叶文洁的第一印象就是，与当年的整齐划一相比，她们之间的差异 变大了。其中的一人变得很瘦小，当年的衣服穿在身上居然还有些大 了，她的背有些弯，头发发黄，已显出一丝老态；另一位却变得十分粗 壮，那身衣服套在她粗笨的身体上扣不上扣子，她头发蓬乱，脸黑黑的， 显然已被艰难的生活磨去了所有女性的精致，只剩下粗鲁和麻木了；第 三个女人身上倒还有些年轻时的影子，但她的一只袖管是空的，走路时 荡来荡去。 三个老红卫兵走到叶文洁面前，面对着她站成了一排当年，她 们也是这样面对叶哲泰的试图再现那早已忘却的尊严，但她们当 年那魔鬼般的精神力量显然已荡然无存。瘦小女人的脸上有一种老鼠 的表情，粗壮女人的脸上只有麻木，独臂女人的两眼望着天空。 “你以为我们不敢来？”粗壮女人挑衅似的问道。 “我觉得我们应该见见面， 过去的事情总该有个了结的。 ” 叶文洁 说。 “已经了结了，你应该听说过的。 ”瘦小女人说，她的声音尖尖的， 仿佛时刻都带着一种不知从何而来的惊恐。 “我是说从精神上。 ” “那你是准备听我们忏悔了？ ”粗壮女人问。 “你们不该忏悔吗？ ” “那谁对我们忏悔呢？ ”一直沉默的独臂女人说。 粗壮女人说： “我们四个人中， 有三个在清华附中的那张大字报上 签过名，从大串联、大检阅到大武斗，从‘一司’ 、‘二司’ 、‘三司’到 ‘联动’ 、‘西纠’ 、‘东纠’ ，再到‘新北大公社’ 、‘红旗战斗队’和 ‘东方红’ ，我们经历过红卫兵从生到死的全过程。 ” 独臂女人接着说： “在清华校园的百日大武斗中，我们四个人，两 个在‘井冈山’ ，两个在‘四一四’ 。我曾经举着手榴弹冲向‘井冈山’ 的土造坦克，这只手被坦克轮子压碎了，当时血肉和骨头在地上和成了 泥那年我才十五岁啊。 ” 地球往事 三体 227 “后来我们走向广阔天地了！ ”粗壮女人扬起双手说， “我们四个， 两个去了陕西，两个去了河南，都是最偏僻最穷的地方。刚去的时候还 意气风发呢，可日子久了，干完一天的农活，累得连衣服都洗不动；躺在 漏雨的草屋里，听着远处的狼叫，慢慢从梦里回到现实。我们待在穷乡 僻壤里，真是叫天天不语，叫地地不应啊。 ” 独臂女人呆呆地看着地面说： “有时，在荒山小径上，遇到了昔日 的红卫兵战友，或是武斗中的敌人，双方互相看看，一样的衣衫破烂，一 样的满身尘土和牛粪，相视无语啊。 ” “唐红静， ”粗壮女人盯着叶文洁说， “就是那个朝你父亲的头抽 了最要命一皮带的女孩儿，在黄河中淹死了。洪水把队里的羊冲走几 只，队支书就冲知青们喊：革命小将们， 考验你们的时候到了！于是，红 静就和另外三个知青跳下河去捞羊，那时还是凌汛，水面上还浮着一层 冰呢！四个人全死了，谁知是淹死的还是冻死的。见到他们尸首的时候 ……我……我他妈说不下去了……”她捂着脸哭了起来。 瘦小女人流着泪长叹一声： “后来回城了， 可回来又怎么样呢？还 是一无所有，回来的知青日子都不好过，而我们这样的人最次的工作都 找不到，没有工作没有钱没有前途，什么都没有了。 ” 叶文洁彻底无语了。 独臂女人说： “最近有一部电影，叫《枫》 ，不知你看过没有？结尾 处，一个大人和一个小孩儿站在死于武斗的红卫兵墓前，那孩子问大 人：他们是烈士吗？大人说不是；孩子又问：他们是敌人吗？大人说也不 是；孩子再问：那他们是什么？大人说：是历史。 ” “听到了吗？是历史！ 是历史了！ ” 粗壮女人兴奋地对叶文洁挥着 一只大手说， “现在是新时期了，谁还会记得我们，拿咱们当回事儿？大 家很快就会忘干净的！ ” 三个老红卫兵走了，把叶文洁一个人留在操场上，十多年前那个阴 雨霏霏的下午，她也是这样孤独地站在这里，看着死去的父亲。那个老 红卫兵最后的一句话在她脑海中不停地回响着…… 中国科幻基石丛书 228 夕阳给叶文洁瘦弱的身躯投下长长的影子。在她的心灵中，对社会 刚刚出现的一点希望像烈日下的露水般蒸发了，对自己已经做出的超级 背叛的那一丝怀疑也消失得无影无踪，将宇宙间更高等的文明引入人 类世界，终于成为叶文洁坚定不移的理想。,"2 6 N o O n e R e p e n t s The deaths of Lei and Y ang were treated as accidents. Everybody at the base knew that Y e and Y ang were a happy couple, and no one suspected her . A new commis sar came to the base, and life returned to its habitual peace. The tiny life inside Y e g rew bigger every day , and she also felt the world outside change. One day , the se curity platoon commander asked Y e to come to the gatehouse at the entrance to the base. When she entered the gat ehouse, she was surprised to see three child ren: two boys and a girl, about fifteen or sixteen. They all wore old coats and dog fur hats, obviously locals. The guard on duty told her that they came from the village of Qijiatu n. They had heard that the p eople on Radar Peak were learned and had come to ask some questions related to their studies. Y e won dered ho w they dared to come onto Radar Peak. This was a restricted military zone, and the guards were authorized to warn intruders only on ce before shooting. The guard saw that Y e was puzzled and explained that they had just received orders that Red Coast Base’ s security rating ha d been reduced. The locals were allowed onto Radar Peak as long as they stayed outside the base. Several local peasants had already come yesterday to bring vegetables. One of the children took out a worn-out middle school physics textbook. His hands were dirty and cracked like tree bark. In a thick Northeastern accent, h e asked a simple physic s question: The textbook said th at a body infree fall is under constant acceleration but will always reach a terminal velocity . They had been thinking about this for several nights and could not understand why . “Y ou walked all this way just to ask this?” Y e asked. “T eacher Y e, don’ t you know that they’ve restarted the exam?” the girl said excitedly . “The exam?” “The Na tional C ollege Entrance Exam! Whoever studies hard and gets the best score g ets to go to college! It began two years ago. Didn’ t you know?” “There’ s no need for recommendations anymore?” “No. An yone ca n take the exam . Even the children of the Five Black Categories in the village can take it.”35 Y e was stunned. This change left her with mixed feelings. Only after a while di d she realize that the c hildren were still waiting with their books held up. She hurriedly answered their question, explaining that i t was due to air r esistance reaching equilibri um against the force of gravit y . Then she promised that if they encountered any dif ficulties in their stu dies in the future, they could always come to her for help. Three days later , seven children came to seek Y e. In addition to the three who had come last time, there were four more from villages l ocated even farther away . The third time, fif teen children came to find her , and even a teacher at a small-town high school came along. Because there was a shortage of teachers, he had to teach physic s, math, and chemistry , and he came to a sk Y e for some help on teaching. The man was over fifty y ears old, and his face was already full of wrinkles. He was very ner vous in front of Y e, and spilled books everywhere. Af ter they left the gatehouse, Y e heard him say to the students: “Children, that was a scientist . A real, bona fide scientist !” After that, children would com e to her for tutoring every few days. Sometimes there were so many of them that the gatehouse couldn’ t accommodate them all. W ith the permission of the of ficers in char ge of base security , the guards would escort them to the cafeteria. There, Y e put up a small blackboard and taught the children.It was dark by the time Y e got of f work on the eve of Chinese New Y ear , 19 80. Mo st people at the base had already left Radar Peak for the three-day holida y , and it was quiet everywhere. Y e returned to her room. This wa s once the home of her and Y ang W eining, but now it was empty , her only compa nion the unborn child within her . In the night outside, the cold win d of the Greater Khingan Mountains screamed, carrying with it the faint sou nd of firecrackers going of f in the village of Qijiatun. Loneliness pressed down on Y e like a gian t hand, and she felt herself being crushed; compressed until she was so small that she disappeared into an invisible corner of the universe.… Just then, someone knocked on her door . When she opened it, Y e first saw the guard, a nd then, behind him, the fire of several pine branch torches flickering in the cold wind. The torches were held aloft by a crowd of children, their faces bright red from the cold, and icicles hung from their hats. When they came into her room, they seemed to bring the cold air in with them. T wo of the boys, thin ly dressed, had suf fered the mo st. They had taken of f their t hick coats and wrapped them around somethin g that they carried in their arms. Unwrapping the coats revealed a lar ge pot, the fermented cabbage and pork dumplings inside still steaming hot. * * * That yea r , eight months after she sent her signal toward the sun, Y e went into labor . Because the baby was malpositioned and her body was weak, the base clin ic could n’ t handle her case and had to send her to the n earest town hospital. This bec ame one of the hardest times in Y e’ s life. After endurin g a great deal of pain and losing a lar ge amount of blood, she sank into a coma. Through a blur she could only see three hot, blinding suns slow ly orbiting around h er , crue lly roasting her body . This state lasted for some time, and she hazily thought it was probab ly the end for her . It was her hell. The fire of t he three su ns would torment her and burn her forever . This was punishment for her betrayal, the betrayal that exceeded all othe rs. She sank into terror: not for her , but for her unborn childwas the child still in her? Or had she already been born into this hell to suf fer eternally with her?She didn ’ t know how much time had passed. Gradually the three suns moved f arther away . After a c ertain distance, they suddenly shrank and turned into crystalline flying stars. The air around her cooled, and her pain lessened. She finally awoke. Y e h eard a cry next to her . T urn ing her head with great ef fort, she saw the baby’ s pink, wet, little face. The doctor told Y e that she h ad lost more than 2,000 ml of blood. Dozens of peasants from Qijiatun had come to donate blood to h er . Many of the p easants had children who Y e had tutored, but most had no connection to her at all, having only heard her name from the children and their parents. W ithout them, she would certainly have died. Y e’ s livi ng situa tion became a p roblem after the birth of her child. The dif ficult birth had damaged her health. It was impossible for her to stay at the base with th e baby all by herself, and she had no relatives who could help. Just then, an old couple living in Qijiatun came to talk to the base leaders a nd explained that they could take Y e and her baby hom e with them and take care of them. The old man used to be a hunter and also gathered some herbs for traditional medi cine. Later , after the forest around the area was lost to logging, the couple had turned to farming, but peopl e still called him Hunter Qi out of habit. They had two sons and two dau ghters. The daughters were married and had moved out. One of the sons was a soldier away from home, and the other was married and lived with them. The daughter -in-law had also just given birth. Y e still hadn’ t been rehabilitated politically , and the base leadership was unsure a bout th is suggested solution. But in the end, there was no other way , and so they allowed the couple to take Y e and the baby home from the hospital on a sled. Y e lived for more than half a year with this peasant family in the Greater Khingan Mount ains. She was s o weak after giving birth that her milk did not c ome in. During this time, the baby girl, Y ang Dong, was breastfed by all th e w omen of the village. The one who nursed her the most was Hunter Qi’ s dau ghter -in-law , called Feng. Feng had the strong, solid f rame of the women of the Northeast. She ate sor ghum every day , and her lar ge breasts were ful l of milk even though she was feeding two babies at the same time. Other nu rsing w omen in Qijiatun also came to feed Y ang Dong. They liked her , saying that the baby had the same clever air as her mother .Gradually , Hunter Qi’ s home became the gathering place for all the women of the village. Old and young, matrons and maidens, they all liked to st op b y when they had nothing else going on. They admired Y e and were curious about her , and she found that she had many women’ s topics to discuss with them. On c ountless days, Y e held Y ang Dong and sat with the other women of the villa ge in the yard, surroun ded by birch posts. Next to her was a lazy black do g and the playing children, bathing in the warm sunlight. She paid attention especially to the women with the copper tobacco pipes. Leisurely , they blew smoke out of their mouths, and the smoke, filled with sunlight, gave of f a silver y glow much li ke the fine hairs on their plump limbs. One time, on e of them handed her th e long-stemmed cupronickel pipe and told her it would make her feel better . She took only two hits before she became dizzy , and they laughed about it for several days. As f or the men, Y e had little to say to them. The matters that o ccupied them all day als o seemed outside her understanding. She gather ed that they were interested in planting some ginseng for cash while the government seemed to be relaxing policies a little, but they didn’ t quite have the courage to try . They all treated Y e with great respect and were very po lite toward her . She didn’ t pay much attent ion to this at first. But after a while, after observing how those men roughly beat their wives and flirted outrageously with the widows in the village, saying things that made her blush, she finally r ealized how precious their respect was. Every few d ays, one of them would bring a hare or phe asant he had caught to Hunter Qi’ s home. They als o gave Y ang Dong strange and quaint toys that they’d made with their own hands. In Y e’ s m emory , these months seemed to belong to someone else, like a segment of another life that had drifted into hers like a feather . This period condensed in her memory into a series of classical paintingsnot Chinese brush paintings but European oi l paintings. Chinese brush paintings are full of b lank spaces, but life in Qijiatun had no blank spaces. Like classical oil paintings, it was filled with thick, rich, solid colors. Everything was warm and intense: the heated kang stove-beds lined with thick layers of ura sedge, the Guandong and Mohe tobacco stuf fed in copper pipes, the thick and heavy so r ghum meal, the sixty-five-proof baijiu d istilled from sor ghumall of these blen ded into a quiet and peaceful life, like the creek at the edge of the village. Most me morable to Y e were the evenings. Hunter Qi’ s son was away in the city selling mushroomsthe first to leave the village to earn money elsewhere, so she shared a room in his house with Feng. Back then, there was no electricit y in the village, and every evening, the two huddled around a ke rosene lamp. Y e would read while Feng did her needlework. Y e would lean closer and closer to the lamp without noticing, and her bangs would often ge t singed, at which point the two of them would glance u p and smile at each other . Feng, of course, never had this happen to her . S he had very sharp eyes, and could do detailed work even in the dim light from heating charcoal. The two babies, not even half a year old, would be sleeping together on the kang nex t to them. Y e loved to watch them sleep, their even breathing the only sound in the room. At first, Y e did n ot like sleeping on the heated kang, and often got sick, but she graduall y got used to it. As she slept, she would imagine herself becoming a baby sleeping in someone’ s warm lap. The person who held her wasn’ t her father or mother , or her dead husband. She didn’ t know who it was. The feeling was so real that she would wake up with tears on her face. One tim e, she put down her book and saw that Feng was holding the cloth sh oe she was stitching over her knee and staring into th e kerosene lamp without moving. When she realized that Y e was looking at her , Feng asked, “Sister , why do you think the stars in the sky don’ t fall down?” Y e e xamined Feng. The keros ene lamp was a wonderful ar tist and created a classical painting with dignified colors and bright strokes: Feng had her coat draped over her sh oulders, exposing her red belly-band, and a strong, g raceful arm. The glow from the kerosene lamp painte d her figure with vivid, warm colors, while the rest of the room dissolved into a gentle darkness. Close attention reveal ed a dim red glow , which didn’ t come from the kero sene lam p, but the hea ting charcoal on the ground. T he cold air outside s culpted beautiful ice patterns on the windowpanes with the room’ s warm, humid air . “Y ou’re afraid of the stars falling down?” Y e asked softly . Feng laughed and shook her head. “What’ s there to be afraid of? They’re so tiny .”Y e did not give her the answer of an astrophysicist. She only said, “They’re very , very far away . They can’ t fall.” Feng wa s satisfi ed with this ans wer , and went back to her needlework. But Y e could no longer be at peace. She put down her book an d lay down on t he w arm sur face of the kang, cl osing her eye s. In her imagin ation, the rest of the universe around their tiny cottage disappeared, just the way the kerosene lamp hid most of the room in darkness. Then she sub stituted the universe in Feng’ s heart for the real one. The night sky was a black dome that was just lar ge enough to cover the entirety of the world. Th e surface of the dom e was inlaid with countless stars shining with a crystalline silver light, none of which was bigge r than the mirror on the old wooden table next to the bed. The world was flat and extended very far in each direction, but u ltimately there was an edge where it met the sky . The flat surface was covered with mountain ranges like the Greater Khingan Mountains, and with forests dotted with tiny vill ages, just like Qijiatun.… This t oy-box-like universe comforted Y e, and gradually it shifted from her imagination into her dreams. In this tiny mou ntain hamlet deep in the Greater Khingan Mountains, something finall y thawed in Y e W enjie’ s heart. In the frozen tundra of her soul, a tiny , clear lake of meltwater appeared. * * * Y e eventually returned to Red Coast Base with Y ang Dong. Another two years passed, divided between a nxiety and peace. Y e then receiv ed a notice: Both sh e and her father had been politically rehabilitated. S oon after , a letter arrived for her from T singhua, stating that she could return to teach right aw ay . Acc ompanying the letter was a sum of money: the back pay owed to her father after his rehabilitation. Finally , at base m eetings, her supervisors could call her comrade . Y e faced all th ese changes with equanimity , showing no sign of excitement or elation. She had no interest in the outside world, only wanting to stay at the quiet, out-of-the-way Red Coast Base. But for the sake of Y ang Dong’ s education, she finally left the base that she had once thought would be her home for the rest of her life, and returned to her alma mater .Leaving the mountains, Y e felt s pring was everywhere. The cold winter of the Cultural Revolution real ly was over , and everything was springing back to life. Even though the calamity had just ended, everything was in ruins, an d countless men and women were licking their wounds . The dawn of a new life was already evident. Students with children of their own appeared on college campuses; bookstores sold out of famous literary works; technological innovation became the focus in factories; and scientific researc h now enjoyed a sacred halo. Science and techn ology were the only keys to opening the door to the future, and people approached science with the faith and since rity of elementary school students. Though their ef f orts were nave, they were also down-to-earth. At the first National Conference on Science, Guo Moruo, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, declar ed that it was the season of rebirth and renewal for China’ s battered science establishment. W as this the end of the madness? W ere science and rationality really coming back? Y e asked herself these questions repeatedly . Y e n ever again received any co mmunication from T risolaris. She knew that she would h ave to wait at least eight years to hear that worl d’ s response to her message, and after leaving the base, she no longer had any way of receiving extraterrestrial replies. It was such an i mportant thing, and yet she had done it all by herself. This gave her a sense of unreality . As time passed, that sense grew ever stronger . What had happened resembled an illusion, a dream. Co uld the sun really amplify radio signals? Did she really use it as an antenna to send a message about human civilizatio n into the universe? Did she really receive a message from the stars? Did that blood-hued morning, when she had betrayed the entire human race, really happen? And those murders … Y e tried to numb herself with w ork so as to for get the pastand almost succeeded. A strange kind of self-protective instinct caused her to stop recalling the past, to stop thinking about the communication sh e had once had with anothe r civilization. Her life passed this way , day after day , in tranquility . * * *After she had be en back at T singhua for a while, Y e took Dong Dong to see her gran dmother , Shao Lin. After her husband’ s death, Shao had soon recovered from her mental break down and found ways to surviv e in the tiny cracks o f politic s. Her attempts to chase the political winds and shout the right slo gans finally paid of f, and later , during the “Return to Class, Continue the Revolution” phase, she went back to teaching.36 But then Shao did something that no one expected. She m arried a persecuted high-level cadre from the Education Ministry . At that time, the cadre still lived in a “cowshed” for reform through labor .37 This was part of Shao’ s l ong-term plan. She knew that the chaos in society could not last long. The young rebels who w ere attacking everything in sight had no experience in managing a cou ntry . Sooner or later , the pers ecuted and sidelined old cadres would be back in power . Her gam ble paid of f. Even bef ore the end of the Cultural Revolution, her husb and was partially restored to his old position. Afte r the Third Plenary Session of the Elevent h CPC Central Committee,38 h e was soon promoted to the level of a deput y minister . Based on this backg round, Shao Lin also rose quickly as intellect uals became favored again. After becoming a me mber of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, she very wisely left her old school a nd was promoted to be the vice president of another famous university . Y e W enjie saw this new version of her mother as the very model of an educated woman who knew ho w to take care of herself. There was not a hint of the persecution that she went through. She enth usiastically welcomed Y e and Dong Dong, inquired after Y e’ s life during those years with concern, exclaimed that Dong Dong was so cute and smart, and meticulously directed the cook in preparing Y e’ s favorite dishes. Everything was done with skill, practice, and the appropriate level of care. But Y e could clearly detect an invisible wall between her mother and herself. They carefully avoided sensitive topics and never mentioned Y e’ s father . After dinner , Shao Lin and her husband accompanied Y e and Dong Dong do wn to the street to say good-bye. Then Shao Lin retu rned home while the deputy minister asked to have a word with Y e. In a m oment, the deputy m inister ’ s kind smile turned to frost, as though he had impatiently pulled of f his mask.“W e’re happy to have you and the child visit in the future un der one condition: Do not try to pursue old historical debts. Y our mother bears no responsibility for your father ’ s death. She was a victim as well. Y our father clung to his own faith in a manner that was not healthy and walked all the way down a blind alley . He abandoned his responsibility to his family and caused you and your mother to suf fer .” “Y ou ha ve no right to speak of my father ,” Y e said, anger suf fu sing her voice. “This is between my mother and me. It has nothing to do with you.” “Y ou’re right,” Shao Lin’ s husb and said coldly . “I’m only passing on a message from your mother .” Y e look ed up at the residential apartment building reserved for high- level cadres. Shao Lin had lifted a corner of the curtain to peek down at them. W ithout a word, Y e bent down to pick up Dong Dong and left. She never returned. * * * Y e searc hed and searched for information about the four female Red Guards who had killed her father , and e ventually managed to locate three of them. All three had been sent down to the countryside39 and then returne d, and all were un employed. After Y e got their addresses, she wrote a brief letter to each of them, a sking them to m eet her at the exercise grounds where her father had died. Just to talk. Y e had no desire for revenge. B ack at Red Coast Base, on that morning of th e transmission, she had go tten revenge against the entire human race, including those Red Guards. Bu t she wanted to hear these murderers repent, wanted to see even a hint of the return of humanity . That aft ernoon a fter class, Y e w aited for them on the exercise grounds. She didn ’ t have much hope, and was almost certain that they wo uldn’ t show up. But at the time of the appointment, the three old Red Guards came. Y e recog nized them from a distance because they were all dressed in now-rare green military uniform s. When they came closer , she realized that the uniforms were likely the sam e ones they had worn at that mass struggle session. The clothes had been laundered until their color had faded, and they had been c onspicuously patched. Other than the uniform s, the three women in their thirties no long er resembled the three young Red Guardswho had looked so valiant on t hat day . They had lost not only youth, but also something else. The first impres sion Y e had was that, though the three had once seemed to be carved ou t of the same mold, they now looked very dif ferent from each oth er . One had become v ery thin and small, and her uniform hung loose on her . Already showing h er age, her back was bent and he r hair had a yellow t int. Another had become thick framed, so that the uniform jacket she wore could not even be butto ned. Her hair was messy and her face dark, as th ough the ha rdship of life h ad robbed her of any feminine refinement, leaving behind only numbness and rudeness. The third wom an still had hints of her youthful appearance , but one of her sleeves was now empty and hung loose as she walked. The three old Red Guards stood in front of Y e in a rowjust like they had stood against Y e Zhetaitrying to recapture their long-for gotten dignity . But the demonic spiritual ener gy that had once propelle d them was gone. The thin woman’ s face held a mouselike expression. The thickset woman’ s face showed only num bness. The one-armed woman gazed up at the sky . “Did you think we wouldn’ t d are to show up?” the thickset woman asked, her tone trying to be provocative. “I thoug ht we should see each other . There should be some cl osure to the past,” Y e said. “The past is fini shed. Y ou should know that.” The thin woman’ s voice was sharp, as though she was always frightened of something. “I meant spiritual closure.” “Then you want to hear us repent?” the thick woman asked. “Don’ t you think you should?” “Then who will repent to us?” the one-armed woman asked. The thickset woman said, “Of t he four of us, three had signed the big- character poster at the high school attached to T singhua. Re volutionary tours, the great rallies in T iananmen, the Red Guard Civil W ars, First Red Headquarters, Second Red Headquarters, Third Red Headquarters, Joint Action Committee, W estern Pickets, Eastern Pickets, New Peking University Com mune, Red Flag Combat T eam, The East is Red we went through every single milestone in the history of the Red Guards from birth to death.”The one-armed woman took o ver . “During the Hundred-Day W ar at T singhua, two of us were with the Jinggang Mountain Corps, and the other two wer e with the April Fourteenth Faction. I held a grenade an d attacked a homemade tank from the Jinggang Mountain faction. My arm was crushed by the treads on the tank. My blo od and muscle and bones were ground into the mud. I was only fifteen years old.”40 “Then, w e were sent to the wilderness!” The thickset woman raised her arms. “T wo of us were sent to Shaanxi, the other two to Henan, all to the most re mote and poorest corners. When we first went, we were still idealistic, but that didn’ t last. A fter a day of laboring in the fiel ds, we were so ti red that we couldn’ t even wash our clothes. W e lay in leaky straw huts and liste ned to wolves cry in the night, and gradually we wok e from our dreams. W e were stuck in those for gotten villages and no one cared about us at all.” The one -armed woman stared at the ground numbly . “While we were down in the countryside, some times, on a trail across the barren hill, I’d bump in to anoth er Red Guard comrade or an enemy . W e’d look at each other: th e same ragged clothes, the same dirt and cow shit cove ring us. W e had nothing to say to each other .” The thic kset wom an stared at Y e . “T ang Hongjing was the girl who gave your fath er the fatal strike with her belt. She drowned in the Y e llow River . There was a floo d that carried o f f a few of the sheep kept by the production team. S o the Party secretary called to the sent-down students, ‘Revolutionary y ouths! It’ s time to test your mettle!’ And so, H ongjing and three oth er stud ents jumped into the river to save the sheep. It was early spring, and the s urface of the river was still covered by a thin layer of ice. All four died, and no one knew if it was from drowning or freez ing. When I saw their bodies … I … I … can’ t fucking talk about this any more.” She covered her eyes and sobbed. The thin woman sighed, tears i n her eyes. “Then, later , we returned to the city . But so what if we’re back? W e still have nothing. Rusticated youths w ho hav e returned don’ t lead very good lives. W e can’ t even find the worst jobs. No job, no money , no future. W e have nothing.” Y e had no words.The one-armed woman said, “There was a movie called Maple recently . I d on’ t know if you’ve seen it. A t the end, an adult and a child stand in front of the grave of a Red Guard who had died during the faction civil wars. The child ask s the adult, ‘Are they heroes?’ The adult says no. The child asks, ‘Are they enemies?’ The adult a gain says no. The child asks, ‘Then who are they?’ The adult says, ‘History .’” “Did yo u hear that?” The thickset woman waved an arm excitedly at Y e. “History! History! It’ s a new age now . Who will remember us? Who will think of us, including you? Everyone will for get all this completely!” The thre e old Red Guards dep arted, leaving only Y e on the exercise grounds. More than a dozen years ago, on that rainy afternoon, she had stood al one here as well, gazing at her dead father . The old Red Guard’ s final remark echoed endlessly in her mind.… The sett ing sun cast a long shad ow from Y e’ s slender figure. T he small sliver of hope fo r society that ha d emer ged in her soul had evaporated like a drop of dew in the sun. Her tin y sense of doubt about her supreme act of betrayal had also disappeared without a trace. Y e final ly had her unshakable i deal: to bring superior civilization from elsewhere in the universe into the human world."
地球往事 三体 229 28．伊文斯 回到大学半年后，叶文洁就承担了一个重大课题：一个大型射电天 文观测基地的设计。不久，她就同课题组一起外出为基地选址。最初的 考虑是纯技术上的，与传统的天文观测不同，射电天文对大气质量和可 见光干扰的要求不高，但要尽量避免非可见光频段的电磁干扰。他们跑 了许多地方，最后选择了一个电磁环境最优的地点，这是西北的一个偏 僻山区。 这里的黄土山上几乎没什么植被，水土流失产生的裂谷使山地远远 看去像老人布满皱纹的面孔。在初步选定了几个建站点后，课题组在 一个大部分民屋都是窑洞的村庄旁停留休整，村里的生产队长似乎认定 叶文洁是个有学问的人，就问她是否会讲外国话她问是哪国话， 队长说不知道要是会讲，他就派人上山把白求恩叫下来，队里有事 同他商量。 “白求恩？ ”叶文洁很惊奇。 “俺们也不知道那个外国人的名字，都那么叫他。 ” “他给你们看病吗？ ” “不，他在后山上种树，已经种了快三年了。 ” “种树？ 干什么？ ” “他说是为了养鸟，一种照他的说法快要绝种的鸟。 ” 叶文洁和同事们都很惊奇，就请队长带他们去看看。沿着山路登上 了一个小山顶后，队长指给他们看，叶文洁眼前一亮看到这贫瘠的 黄土山之间居然有一片山坡被绿树林覆盖，像是无意中滴到一块泛黄 中国科幻基石丛书 230 的破旧画布上的一小片鲜艳的绿油彩。 叶文洁一行很快见到了那个外国人，除了他的金发碧眼和身上穿 的那套已经破旧不堪的牛仔服，看上去与当地劳作一生的农民已经没 什么两样，甚至连他的皮肤也被晒成了当地人一样的黄黑。他对来访者 似乎兴趣不大，自我介绍叫麦克伊文斯，没说自己的国籍，但他的英语 带有很明显的美国口音。他住在林边两间简陋的土坯房中，房里堆满了 植树工具：锄头、铁锨和修剪树枝用的条锯等，都是当地很粗笨的那种。 西北的沙尘在那张简陋的床和几件简单的炊具上落了一层，床上堆了 许多书籍，大都是生物学方面的，叶文洁注意到有一本彼得辛格的 《动物解放》 。 能看到的现代化的玩意儿就是一台小收音机， 里面的五 号电池用完了，在外面接了一节一号电池，还有一架旧望远镜。伊文斯 说，很抱歉不能请他们喝什么，咖啡早就没有了，水倒是有，可他只有一 个杯子。 “您在这里到底做什么呢？ ”叶文洁的一个同事问。 “当救世主。 ” “救……救当地人吗？ 这里的生态环境确实是……” “你们怎么都这样？ ！”伊文斯突然爆发出一股莫名的怒气， “难道 只有拯救人类才称得上救世主，而拯救别的物种就是一件小事？是谁给 了人类这种尊贵的地位？不，人不需要救世主，事实上他们现在过得比 应得的好多了。 ” “听说你在救一种鸟？ ” “是的，一种燕子，是西北褐燕的一个亚种，学名很长我就不说了。 每年春天，它们沿着远古形成的固定迁徙路线从南方返回时，只能把这 一带作为目的地，但这里的植被一年年消失，它们已经找不到可以筑巢 和生活的树丛了。当我在这里发现它们时，这个种群的数量已不足万 只，这样下去五年内这个物种就会灭绝。现在，我种的这片树林给一部 分燕子提供了一个落脚点，种群数量已经开始回升，当然，我还要种更 多的树，扩大这个伊甸园的面积。 ” 地球往事 三体 231 伊文斯让叶文洁他们拿着望远镜看，在他的指引下，大家看了半 天，才在树丛中看到了几只黑灰色的鸟儿出没。 “很不起眼，是吗？它们当然没有大熊猫那样引人注目，在这个世 界上，每天都有这样不为人们注意的物种灭绝。 ” “这些树都是你一个人种的吗？ ” “大部分是，开始时我也雇当地人来干，可很快没有那么多钱了， 树苗和引水什么的都很花钱……可你们知道吗？我父亲是亿万富翁，他 是一个跨国石油公司的总裁，但他不再给我钱，我也不想用他的钱 了。” 伊文斯的话匣子打开了，滔滔不绝地说下去， “我十二岁那年，我 父亲公司的一艘三万吨级的油轮在大西洋沿岸海域触礁，两万多吨的 原油泄入海中。当时，我们一家正在距事故发生海域不远处的度假别墅 中。那天下午，我来到了那片地狱般的海岸，看到大海已变成黑色，海浪 在黏稠油膜的压迫下变得平滑而无力；海滩也被一层黑油覆盖。我和一 些志愿者就在这黑滩上寻找那些还活着的海鸟，它们在油污中挣扎着， 一个个像是用沥青做成的黑色雕塑，只有那一双双眼睛还能证明自己 是活物，那油污中的眼睛多少年以后还常常在我的噩梦中出现。我们把 那些海鸟浸泡在洗涤液中，想把它们身上的油污洗掉，但十分困难，油 浆和羽毛死死地黏在一起，稍用力羽毛就和油污一起一片片掉下来 ……傍晚，那些海鸟大部分还是死了。当时我浑身油污地瘫坐在黑色的 海滩上，看着夕阳在黑色的大海上落下，感觉这就是世界末日了。 “父亲不知什么时候来到我身后，他问我是否记得那副小恐龙骨 架。我当然记得，那是在石油勘探中发现的，很完整，父亲花大价钱把它 买了下来，安放到外公的庄园里。父亲接着说：麦克，我给你讲过恐龙是 怎样灭绝的，一颗小行星撞击了地球，世界先是一片火海，然后陷入漫 长的黑暗与寒冷……那天夜里你被噩梦吓醒了，你说梦中自己回到了 那个可怕的时代。现在我要告诉你当时想说但没说出来的一件事：如果 真的生活在白垩纪晚期，那是你的幸运，因为我们的时代更恐怖，现在， 中国科幻基石丛书 232 地球生命物种的灭绝速度，比白垩纪晚期要快得多，现在才是真正的大 灭绝时代！所以，孩子，你看到的这些算不了什么，这不过是一个大过程 中微不足道的小插曲而已。我们可以没有海鸟，但不能没有石油，你能 想象没有石油是什么样子吗？去年送你的生日礼物，那辆漂亮的法拉 利，我许诺你十五岁以后能开它，可如果没有石油，它就是一堆废铁，你 永远开不了；现在你想去外公家，乘我的专机越过大洋也就十几个小 时，可要是没有石油，你就得在帆船上颠簸一个月……这就是文明的游 戏规则，首先要保证人类的生存和他们舒适的生活，其余都是第二位 的。 “父亲对我寄予很大的希望，但他最终也没有使我成为他希望的 人。在往后的日子中，那些濒死的海鸟眼睛一直在背后盯着我，决定了 我的人生。在我十三岁的生日时，父亲问我将来的打算，我说没什么，我 只想当个救世主而已。我的理想真的不宏伟，只是想拯救一个濒临灭绝 的物种，它可以是一种不漂亮的鸟，一种灰乎乎的蝴蝶，或是一种最不 起眼的小甲虫。后来我去学习生物学，成为一个鸟类与昆虫学家。在我 看来自己的理想很伟大，拯救一种鸟或昆虫与拯救人类没有区别，生命 是平等的，这就是物种共产主义的基本纲领。 ” “什么？”叶文洁一时没有听清那个词。 “物种共产主义，这是我创立的一个学说，也可以说是一个信仰， 它的核心理念就是：地球上的所有生命物种，生来平等。 ” “这只是一个理想，不现实。农作物也是物种，人类只要生存下去， 这种平等就不可能实现。 ” “在遥远的过去，领主对奴隶也有过这种想法。不要忘了技术，总 有一天，人类能够合成粮食，而早在那之前，我们就应该做好思想和理 论上的准备。其实，物种共产主义是《人权宣言》的自然延续，法国大革 命二百年了，我们居然还没迈出这一步，可见人类的自私和虚伪。 ” “你还打算在这里待多长时间呢？ ” “不知道，做一个救世主，付出一生也是值得的，这感觉很美，很 地球往事 三体 233 妙。当然，我不指望你们。 ” 伊文斯说完这话，突然又变得谈兴索然，说他要去工作，就拿起一 把铁锹和一把锯离开了。道别时，他多看了叶文洁一眼，似乎她身上有 什么特别的东西。 “一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低 级趣味的人。 ”在回去的路上，叶文洁的一个同事背诵了《纪念白求 恩》中的一句话， “原来还可以这样生活。 ”他感叹道。 其他人也纷纷表示自己的赞同和感慨，叶文洁似乎是自言自语地 说：“要是他这样的人多些，哪怕是稍多些，事情就会完全不一样的。 ” 当然，没人理解她话里的真正含义。 课题组负责人将话题转到工作上， “我觉得这个站址不行， 领导也 不会批的。 ” “为什么？在我们的四个站址方案中，这里的电磁环境可是最好 的。 ” “人文环境呢？同志， 不要只想着技术方面， 看这里穷的， 知道吗？ 穷山恶水出刁民，将来与地方上的关系怕有很大麻烦，说不定，基地会 成了这儿的唐僧肉。 ” 这个选址果然没被批准，原因就如负责人所说。 三年过去了，叶文洁再也没有伊文斯的消息。 这年春季的一天，叶文洁突然收到了一张明信片，竟是伊文斯寄来 的，上面简单地写了一句话： 到这里来，告诉我怎么活下去。 叶文洁坐了一天一夜火车，又换乘几个小时的汽车，来到了那个偏 僻的西北山村。 当她登上那座小山顶时，立刻看到了那片树林，面积与三年前差不 多，但由于树木的成长，看上去密了许多。不过，叶文洁很快发现，这片 林子的面积曾经扩大了许多，但现在，扩大的部分已被砍伐了砍伐 中国科幻基石丛书 234 仍在热火朝天地进行，在林子的各个方向都有树木不断地倒下，整个林 子像一片被许多只蚜虫蚕食的绿叶，照这个速度很快就会消失。砍树的 村民来自附近的两个村子，他们用斧子和板锯把那些刚刚成长起来的 小树一棵棵地放倒，然后用拖拉机和牛车运下山去。砍树的很多，不 断有激烈的争执发生。 小树的倒下没有什么巨大的声响，也听不到油锯的轰鸣，但这似曾 相识的一幕还是让叶文洁心头一紧。 有人向她打招呼，是那个生产队长，现在的村长，他认出了叶文洁。 当她问他为什么砍林子的时候，他说： “这片林子嘛，不受法律保护 的。” “怎么能这么说？ 《森林法》不是刚刚颁布吗？ ” “可白求恩在这儿种树经过谁批准了？外国人擅自到中国的山坡 上种树，受哪门子法律保护？ ” “这说法不对的。他在荒山上种，又没有占耕地，再说，他当初种的 时候你们也没有说什么。 ” “是啊，后来县里还给了他一个造林模范呢。本来村里是想过几年 再收林子的，猪养肥了再杀嘛，可南圪村的人等不及来砍了，我们不动 手也没份儿了。 ” “你们马上停下来！我要到政府部门去反映这事！ ” “不用了， ”村长点上一支烟，指指远方正在装树木的一辆大货车， “看那车，就是县林业局副局长的，还有镇派出所什么的，木头数他们 拉走得最多！我说过，这林子没名没份的，不受保护，你到哪儿找都没 用；再说，叶同志，你不是大学教授吗？这和你有嘛关系？ ” 那两间土坯房还是原样，但伊文斯不在里面，叶文洁在树林里找到 了他，他正拿着一把斧子一心一意地修剪树枝，显然已经干了很久，一 副疲惫不堪的样子。 “不管有没有意义，我不能停下来，停下来我会崩溃的。 ”伊文斯 说，熟练地砍下一条歪枝。 地球往事 三体 235 “我们一起去县里找政府，不行就去省城，总会有人制止他们的。 ” 叶文洁关切地看着他。 伊文斯停下来，用很惊奇的目光看着叶文洁，夕阳透过重重林木照 进来，在他的眸子中闪亮。 “叶，你真的以为我是为了这片树林？”他笑 着摇摇头，扔下了手中的斧子，靠着一棵树坐了下来， “我现在要想制 止他们，轻而易举。 ”他把一只空的工具袋放到地上，示意叶文洁坐下， 接着说， “我刚从美国回来，父亲在两个月前去世，我继承了他的大部 分遗产。哥哥和姐姐只各得了五百万。这让我很意外，真的没想到他最 后能对我这样，也许，他在内心深处还是看重我的，或者，看重我的理 想。不把不动产算在内，知道我现在能支配的钱有多少吗？大约四十五 亿美元。我可以轻而易举地让他们停止砍树，然后让他们种树，让我们 目力所及的黄土山都被这样的速生林覆盖，很容易，但有什么意义呢？ 你看到的一切可以归结为贫穷，但富裕的国家又怎么样？他们营造自己 的优美环境，却把重污染工业向穷国转移，你可能知道，美国政府刚刚 拒绝签署京都议定书……整个人类本质上都一样，只要文明像这样发 展，我想拯救的这种燕子，还有其他的燕子，迟早都会灭绝，只是时间问 题。 ” 叶文洁默默地坐着，看着落日在小树林中投出的一道道光线，听着 远处砍伐的喧闹，她的思绪回到了二十年前，回到了大兴安岭的森林 中，那里，她与另一个男人也有过类似的对话。 “知道我为什么到这里来吗？” 伊文斯接着说， “物种共产主义的 思想萌芽在古代东方就出现了。 ” “你指的是佛教？ ” “是的，基督教只重视人，虽然所有物种都被放入了诺亚方舟，但 从来没有给其他生命与人类同等的地位，而佛教是普度众生的，所以我 来到了东方。但……现在看来哪里都一样。 ” “是啊，哪里都一样，人类都一样。 ” “现在我能做什么？我生活的支柱在哪里？我有四十五亿美元和一 中国科幻基石丛书 236 家跨国石油公司，但这又算得了什么？人类为了拯救濒危的物种投入的 钱肯定超过了四百五十亿，为拯救恶化的生态环境的投入也超过四千 五百亿，但有什么用？文明仍按照自己的轨迹毁灭着地球上除人之外的 其他生命。四十五亿够建造一艘航空母舰，但就是建造一千艘航母，也 制止不了人类的疯狂。 ” “麦克，这就是我想对你说的，人类文明已经不可能靠自身的力量 来改善了。 ” “但人类之外还有别的力量吗？上帝要是存在也早死了。 ” “有的，有别的力量。 ” 这时太阳已经落下山去，砍树的人们收工了，树林和周围的黄土坡 笼罩在一片寂静中。叶文洁向伊文斯完整地讲述了红岸和三体世界的 事，伊文斯静静地听着，同时聆听的，似乎还有暮色中的树林和它周围 的黄土高原。当叶文洁讲完时，一轮明月从东方升起，在林间投下斑驳的 光影。 伊文斯说： “我现在还不能相信你说的，毕竟太神奇了，幸运的是， 我有力量去证实这一切，如果是真的， ”他向叶文洁伸出手去，说出了 以后地球三体组织接纳新成员时必说的一句话， “我们是同志了。 ”,"2 7 E v a n s Half a year after her return to T singhua, Y e took on an importa nt task: the design of a lar ge radio astronomy observatory . She and the task force traveled around the country to find the best site for the observatory . The initial considerations were purely technical. Unlike traditional astronomy , radio astronomy didn’ t have as many demands on atmospheric quality , but required minimal electromagnetic interference. They travele d to many places a nd fin ally picked a place with the cleanest elec tromagnetic environment: a remote, hilly area in the Northwest. The loess hills h ere had little vegetation cover . Rifts from erosio n made the slope s look like old faces ful l of wrinkles. After selecting a few possible sites, the task force stayed for a brief rest at a village where most of the inhabitants still lived in traditional cave dwellings. The village’ s production team lea der reco gnized Y e as an educated person and asked her whether she knew ho w to speak a foreign language. She asked him which foreign language, and he said he didn’ t know . However , if she did kno w a foreign tongue, he would send someone up the hill to call down Bethu ne, because the production team needed to discuss something with him.41 “Bethune?” Y e was amazed. “W e don’ t know the foreigner ’ s real name, so we just call him that.” “Is he a doctor?” “No. He’ s planting trees up in the hills. Has been at it for almost three years.”“Planting trees? What for?” “He says it’ s for the birds. A kind of bird that he says is almost extinct.” Y e a nd her col leagues were curious and asked the production team leader to bring t hem for a visit. They followed a trail until they were on top of a small hilloc k. The team leader showed them a place among the barren loess hil ls. Y e felt it brighten before her eyes. There was a slope covered by green fo rests, as though an old , yellowing canvas had been accidentally blessed with a splash of green paint. Y e and the others soon saw the foreigner . Other than his blond hair and green ey es and tattered jeans and a jacket that reminded her of a cowboy , he didn’ t lo ok too dif ferent from the local peasants who had labored all their lives. Even his skin had the same dark hue from the sun as the locals. He didn’ t show much interest in th e visitors. He introduced himself as Mike Evans without mentioning his nationality , but his English was clearly American-accented. He lived in a simple two-room adobe hut, which was filled w ith tools for planting trees: hoes, shovels, saws for pruning tree branches, and so on, all of whi ch were locally made and crude. The dust that perm eated t he Northwest lay in a thin layer over his simple and rough- hewn be d and kitchen impleme nts. A pile of books, most of which dealt with bio logy , sa t on his bed. Y e noticed a copy of Peter Singer ’ s Animal Liberation . The only sign of modernity was a small radio set, hooked up to an external D battery . There was also an old telescope. Evans ap ologized for not being able to of fer them anything to d rink. He hadn’ t had cof fee for a while. There was water , but he only had one cup. “May w e ask what you’re really doing here?” one of Y e’ s co lleagues asked. “I want to save lives.” “Save … save the locals? It’ s true that the ecological conditions here” “Why are you all like this?” E vans suddenly became furious . “Why does one have to save people to be considered a hero? Why is saving other species c onsidered insignificant? Who gave humans such high honors? No, humans do not need saving. They’re already living much bette r than they deserve.” “W e heard that you are trying to save a type of bird.” “Y es, a swallow . It’ s a subspeci es of the northwestern brown swallow . The Lati n name is very long, so I won’ t bore you with it. Every spring, theyfollow ancient, established migr atory paths to return from the south. They nest only here, but as the forest disappears year after year , they can no longer find the t rees in which to build their nests. When I disco vered them, the spec ies had less than ten thousand individuals left. If the trend continues, withi n five years it will be extinct. The trees I’ve p lanted now provide a habitat for some of them, and the population is rising again. I must plant more trees and expand this Eden.” Evans al lowed Y e and the others to look through his telescope. W ith his help, they finally saw a few tiny black birds darting through the trees. “Not very pretty , are they? Of course, they’re not as crowd-ple asing as giant pa ndas. Ev ery day on this planet some species that doesn ’ t draw the attention of humans goes extinct.” “Did you plant all of these trees by yourself?” “Most of them. Initially I hired some locals to help, but soon I ra n out of money . Saplings and irrigation a ll cost a lotbut you know something? My father is a billionaire. He is the president of an international o il company , but he will not give me any m ore funding, and I don’ t want to use his money anymore.” Now tha t Evans had opened up, he seemed to want to pour his h eart out. “When I was twelve, a thirty- thousand-ton oil tanker from my father ’ s company ran aground along the Atlantic coast. More than twenty thousand tons of crude oil spilled into the ocean. At the time, my family was staying at a coastal vacation home not too far from the site of the accident. After my fath er heard the news, the first thing he thought of was how to avoid responsibility and minimize damage to the company . “That af ternoon, I went to see the hellish coast. The sea was bl ack, and the wav es, unde r the sticky , thick film of oil, were smooth and weak. The beach was also c overed by a bla ck layer of crude oil. Some volunteers and I searched for birds on the beach that were still alive. They struggled in the sticky oil, looking like black statues made out of asphalt, only their eyes proving that they were still alive. Those eyes staring out of the oil still haunt my dreams to th is day . W e soak ed those birds in deter gent, trying to get rid of the oil stuck t o their bodies. But it was extremely dif ficult: cr ude oil was infused into their feathers, and i f you brushed a little too hard, the feathers would c ome of f with the oil.… By that evening, most of the bir ds had died.As I sat on the black beach, exhausted and covered in oil, I stared at the sun setting over a black sea and felt like it was the end of the world. “My father came up behind me without my noticing. He asked me if I still remembered the small dinosaur skeleton. Of course I remem bered. The nearly complete skeleton had been discovered during oil exploration. My father spent a lar ge sum to buy it, and installed it on the grounds of my grandfather ’ s mansion. “My fat her then said, ‘Mike, I’v e told you how dinosaurs went extinct. An asteroid crashed into the Earth. The world first became a sea of fire, and then san k into a prolonged period of darkness and coldness.… One night, you wok e from a nightmare, saying that you had dreamt that yo u were back in th at terrifying age. Let me te ll you now what I wanted to t ell you that night: If you rea lly lived during the Cretaceous Period, you’d be fortunate. The peri od we live in now is f ar more frightening. Right now , species on Earth are going extinct far faster than during the late Cretaceous. Now is truly the age of mass extinctions! So, my child, what you’re seeing is nothing. This is only an insignificant episode in a much vaster process. W e can have no sea birds, but we can’ t be without oil. Can you imagine life without oil? Y our last birthday , I gave you that lovely Ferrari an d promised you that you could drive it after you turned fifteen. But without oil, it would be a pile of junk metal and you’d never drive it. Right now , if you want to visit your grandfather , you can get there on my personal jet and cross the ocean in a doze n hours or so. But without oil, you’d have to tumble in a sailboat for more than a month.… These are the rules of the game of civilization: The first priority is to guarantee the existence of the human race and their comfortable life. Everything else is secondary .’ “My father placed a great deal of hope in me, but in the end I didn’ t turn out the way he wanted. In the days after that, the eyes of those drowned birds always followed me and determined my life. When I was thirteen, my father asked me what I wanted to do when I grew up. I said I wanted to save lives. My dream wasn’ t that great. I only wanted to save a species near extinction. It could be a bird that wasn’ t very pretty , a drab bu tterfly , or a beetle th at no one would even no tice. Later , I studied biology , and became a specialist on birds and insects. The way I see it, my ideal is worthy . Saving a sp ecies of bird or insect is no dif ferent from saving humankin d. ‘All lives are equal’ is the basic tenet of Pan-Species Communism.”“What?” Y e wasn’ t sure she had heard the last term correctly . “Pan-Species Communism. It’ s an ideology I invented. Or ma ybe you can call it a fai th. Its core beli ef is that all species on Earth are created equal.” “That is an impractical ideal. Our crops are also living species. If humans are to survive, that kind of equality is impossible.” “Slave o wners must also have thought that about their slave s in the distant past. And don’ t for get technologythere will be a day when humanity can manufacture food. W e should lay down the ideological and theoretical foundation long before that. Indeed, Pan-Species Communism is a natural continuation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The French R evolution was two hundred years ago, and we haven’ t even taken a step bey ond that . From this we can see the hypocrisy and selfishness of the human race.” “How long do you intend to stay here?” “I don’ t know . I’m prepared to d evote my life to the task. The f eeling is beautiful. Of course, I don’ t expect you to understand.” Evans seemed to lose interest. He said that he had to go back to work, so he p icked up a shovel and a saw and then left. When he said g ood-bye, he glanced at Y e again, as though there was something unusual about her . On the way back, one of Y e’ s colleagues recited from Chairma n Mao’ s essay “R emembering Bethune”: “‘Noble-minded and pure, a man of moral integrity and above vulgar interests.’” He sighed. “There really are people who can live like that.” Others also expressed their admiration and conflicted feelings. Y e seemed to be sp eaking to herself as she said, “If there were more men like him, even just a few more, things would have turned out dif ferently .” Of course, no one understood what she really meant. The task force leader turned the conversation back to their work. “I think this site isn’ t going to work. Our superiors won’ t approve it.” “Why not? Of t he four possible sites, this has the best electrom agnetic environment.” “What about the human environ ment? Comrades, don’ t just focus on the technical side. Look at how po or this place is. The poorer a village, the craftier the people. Do you understand? If the observatory were located here, there would be trouble between the scientists and the locals. I canimagine the peasants thinking of the astronomy complex as a juicy piece of meat that they can take bites from.” This site was ind eed not approved, and the reason was just what the task force leader had said. * * * Three years passed without Y e hearing anything more about Evans. But one spring day , Y e received a postcard from Evans with only a single line: “Come here. T ell me how to go on.” Y e rode the train for a day and a night, and then switched to a bus for many hours until she arrived at the village nestled in the remote hills of the Northwest. As soon as she c limbed onto that small hillock, she saw the fore st again. Because the trees had grown, it now seemed far denser , but Y e noticed that the fores t had once been much bigger . Newer parts that had g rown in the past few years had already been cut. The logging was in full swing. In every direction, trees were falling. The entire forest seemed like a mulb erry leaf being devoured by silkworms on all sides . At the current rate, it would disappear soon. The wo rkers doing the l ogging came from two nearby villages. Using axes and saws, they cut down those barely grown trees one by one, and then dragged them of f the hill usin g tractors and ox carts. There were many loggers, and fights frequently erupted among them. The fall of each small tree didn’ t make much sound, and there was no loud buzzing from chain saws, but the almost-familiar scene made Y e’ s chest tighten. Someone called out to herthat production team leader , now th e village chief. He recognized Y e. When she asked him why they were cutting down the forest, he said, “This forest isn’ t protected by law .” “How can that be? The Forestry Law has just been promulgated.” “But who ever g ave Bethune permission to plant trees here? A f oreigner coming here to plant trees without approval would not be protected by any law .” “Y ou ca n’ t think that way . He was planting on the barren hills an d didn’ t take up any arable land. Also, back when he started, you didn’ t object.”“That’ s true. The county actually gave him an award for planting the trees. Th e villagers originally planned to cut down the forest in a few more yearsit’ s best to wait until the pig is fat before slaughtering it, am I right? But those people from Nange V illage can’ t wait any longer , and if my village doesn’ t join in, we won’ t get any .” “Y ou must stop immediately . I will go to the government to report this!” “There’ s no need.” The village c hief lit a cigarette and pointed to a truck loading the cut trees in the di stance. “See that? That’ s from the deputy secretary of the County Forestr y Bureau. And there are also people here from the town police department. They’ve carried of f more trees than anyone else! I told you, these trees have no status and aren’ t protected. Y ou’ll never find anyone who cares. Also, comrade, aren’ t yo u a college professor? What does this have to do with you?” The ado be hut looked the same, but Evans wasn’ t inside. Y e fo und him in the woods holding an ax and carefully pruning a tree. He ha d obviously been at it for a while, his posture full of exhaustion. “I don’ t care if this is meaningless. I can’ t stop. If I stop I’ll fal l apart.” Evans cut down a crooked branch with a practiced swing. “Let’ s go together to the county government. If they won’ t do a nything, we’ll go up to the provincial government. Someone will stop them.” Y e looked at Evans with concern. Evans st opped a nd stared at Y e in surprise. Light from the setting sun slanted through the trees and made his eyes sparkle. “Y e, do you really think I’m doing this because o f this forest?” He laughed and shook his head, th en dropp ed the ax. He sat down, his back against a tree . “If I want to stop them, it’d be easy . I just returned from America. My father died two months ago, and I inherited mo st of his money . My brother and sister only got five million each. This wasn’ t what I expected at all. Maybe in his heart, he st ill r espected me. Or maybe he respected my ideals. Not inc luding fixed assets, do you k now how much money I have at my disposal? About four point five billion dollars. I cou ld easily ask them to stop and get them to plant more trees. I could make a ll the loess hills within sight be covered by quick-growth forest. But what would be the point? “Everything you see before yo u is the result of poverty . But how are things any better in the wea lthy countries? They protect their own environments, but then shift the heavily polluting industries to the poorernations. Y ou probably know that the American government just refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol.… The entire human race is the same. As long as civilization cont inues to develop, the swallows I want to save and all the other swallows will go extinct. It’ s just a matter of time.” Y e s at silently , gazing at the rays of light cast among the tree s by the setting s un, liste ning to the noise from the loggers. Her thoughts returned to twenty years ago, to the forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains, where she had once had a similar conversation with another man. “Do you know why I came here?” Evans continued. “The seeds of Pan- Species Communism had sprouted long ago in the ancient East.” “Y ou’re thinking of Buddhism?” “Y es. The focus of Christianity is Man. Even though all the species were placed i nto Noa h’ s Ark, other s pecies were never given the sam e status as humans. But Buddhism is focus ed on saving all life. That was why I came to the East. But … it’ s obvious now that everywhere is the same.” “Y es, that’ s true. Everywhere, people are the same.” “What can I do now? What is the purpose of my life? I have four point five billion dollars and an international oil company . But what good is all that? Hu mans have surely invested more than forty-five billion dollars in saving s pecies near extinction. And probably more than four hundred and fifty billion has already been spent on saving the environ ment from degradation. But what’ s the use? Civilization continues to follow its path of destruction of all life on Earth except humans. Four point five billion is enough to build an aircraft carrier , but even if we build a thousand aircraft carriers, it would be impossible to stop the madness of humanity .” “Mike, t his is what I wanted to tell you. Human civilization is no longer capable of improving by its own strength.” “Can there be any source of power outside of humanity? Even if God once existed, He died long ago.” “Y es, there are other powers.” The sun had set and the loggers had left. The forest and the loess hills were sile nt. Y e now told Evans the whole story of Red Coast and T risolaris. Evans listened quietly , and the loess hills and the forest in dusk seemed to listen as well. When Y e was fin ished, a bright moon rose from the east and cast speckled shadows on the forest floor .Evans sa id, “I still can’ t believe what you just told me. It’ s too f antastic. But luck ily , I have the resources to confirm this. If what you told me is true”he exten ded his hand and spoke the words that every new member of the future ET O would have to say upon joining“let us be comrades.”"
地球往事 三体 237 29．第二红岸基地 又是三年过去了，伊文斯销声匿迹，没有任何消息。叶文洁不知道 他是否真的在世界的某处证实自己讲述的一切，也不知道他将如何证 实。即使在宇宙尺度上是近在咫尺的四光年，对脆弱的生命来说也是不 可想象的遥远，在这太空的江之头和江之尾，任何联系都细若游丝。 这年的冬天，叶文洁突然接到了西欧一所不太知名的大学邀请，请 她去做为期半年的访问学者。到达伦敦西斯罗机场后，有一个年轻人来 接她，他们没有走出机场大厅，而是返回了停机坪。在那里，年轻人带她 登上了一架直升机。当直升机轰鸣着飞上英伦雾蒙蒙的天空时，仿佛时 光倒流，叶文洁感到一切都似曾相识。她多年前第一次乘直升机，经历 了一次命运的转折，这次命运又会将她带向何方？ “我们去第二红岸基地。 ”年轻人说。 直升机越过了海岸线，向大西洋深处飞去。在海上飞行了约半小 时，直升机向下方的一艘巨轮降落。叶文洁第一眼看到巨轮时，就想起 了雷达峰，这时她才想到那山峰的形状真的像一艘巨船，周围的大西洋 像是大兴安岭的森林，但真正让她联想到红岸基地的是巨轮中部竖立 着的那面巨大的抛物面天线，它像巨轮的一面圆形的大帆。这艘巨轮是 由一艘六万吨级的油轮改建的，像一座浮动的钢铁小岛。伊文斯将他的 基地建在船上，也许是为了时刻处于最佳监听和发射方位，也许是为了 躲避什么。后来她知道，这艘巨轮叫“审判日”号。 叶文洁走下直升机，听到了一阵熟悉的轰鸣声，那是巨型天线在海 风中发出的，这声音把她的感觉更深地拉回了过去。天线下面宽阔的甲 中国科幻基石丛书 238 板上，密密麻麻地站了近两千人。伊文斯走上前，庄重地对叶文洁说： “按照你给定的频率和方位，我们收到了三体世界的信息，你所说的一 切都证实了。 ” 叶文洁平静地点点头。 “伟大的三体舰队已经启航，目标是太阳系，将在四百五十年后到 达。 ” 叶文洁脸上仍是一片平静，现在，没有什么能使她震惊了。 伊文斯指着身后密密的人群说： “你现在看到的， 是地球三体组织 的首批成员，我们的理想是请三体文明改造人类文明，遏制人类的疯狂 和邪恶，让地球再次成为一个和谐繁荣、没有罪恶的世界。认同我们理 想的人越来越多，我们的组织在急剧扩大中，成员遍布整个世界。 ” “我能做什么？ ”叶文洁轻声地问。 “您将成为地球三体运动的最高统帅，地球三体战士都认同您的 资格！ ” 叶文洁沉默了几秒钟，缓缓地点点头， “我尽力而为。 ” 伊文斯高举一只拳头，对着人群喊道： “消灭人类暴政！ ” 和着涛声与天线在风中的轰鸣， 三体战士们齐声高呼： “世界属于 三体！ ” 这一天，被公认为地球三体运动的诞生日。,"2 8 T h e S e c o n d R e d C o a s t B a s e Three more years passed. Evan s seemed to have disappeared. Y e didn’ t know if he really was somewhere in the world working to confir m her story , and had no idea how he would c onfirm it. Even though, by the scale of the universe, a gap of four light-ye ars was as close as touching, it was still a distance that was unimaginably far for fragile life. The two worlds were like the source and mouth of a river that crossed space. Any connections between them would be extremely attenuated. One winter , Y e received an invitation from a not-very-prominent university in W estern Europe to be a visiting scholar for half a year . After she landed at H eathrow for her interview , a young man came to meet her . They did n’ t leav e the airport, b ut instead turned back to the landing strip. There, he escorted her onto a helicopter . As t he h elicopter roared into the foggy air over England, time se emed to rewind and Y e experienced déjà vu. Many years ago, when she first rode in a helicopter , her life was transformed. Where would fate bring her now? “W e’re going to the Second Red Coast Base.” The heli copter passed the coastline and continued toward the heart of the Atla ntic. After half an hou r , the helicopter descended toward a huge ship in the ocea n. As soon as Y e saw the ship, she thought of R adar Peak. Only now did she realize that the shape of the peak did resemble a giant ship. The Atlantic appeared like the forest of the Greater Khingan Mountains, but the thing that reminded her most of Red Coast B ase was thehuge par abolic a ntenna erected in the middle of the ship, which resembled a round sail. The ship was modifie d from a sixty-thousand-ton oil tanker , like a f loating steel i sland. Evans had built his base on a shipmaybe it was so that it would always be at the best position for transmission and reception, or maybe it was to hide from detection. Later , she learned that t he ship was called Judgment Day . Y e s tepped of f t he helicopter and heard a familiar howl. It was caused by th e giant ante nna slicing through the wind over the sea. The sound again drew he r though ts to the past. On the broad deck below the antenna, about two thousand people stood in a dense crowd. Evans w alked up to her and solemnly said, “Using the freque ncy and coordinates you provided, we received a message from T risolaris. W e’ve confirmed everything you told me.” Y e nodded calmly . “The gre at T riso laran Fleet has already set sail. Their tar get is t his solar system, and they will arrive in four hundred and fifty years.” Y e remained calm. Nothing could surprise her anymore. Evans pointed to the crowd behind him. “Y ou’re looking at the first members of the Earth-T risolaris Or ganization. Our ideal i s to invite T risolaran civilization to reform human civilization, to curb human madness and evil, so t hat the Earth can once again become a h armonious, prosperous, sinless world. More and more people identify with our ideal, and our or ganization is growing rapidly . W e have members all over the world.” “What can I do?” Y e asked in a soft voice. “Y ou will become the comma nder in chief of the Earth-T risolaris Movement. This is the wish of all ET O fighters.” Y e remained silent for a few seconds. Then she nodded slowly . “I’ll do my best.” Evans raised a fist and shou ted at the crowd, “Eliminate human tyranny!” Accompanied by the sound of crashing waves and the wind howling against t he anten na, the ET O fig hters shouted as one, “The worl d belongs to T risolaris!” This was the day that the Earth-T risolaris Movement formally began."
地球往事 三体 239 30．地球三体运动 竟然有这么多的人对人类文明彻底绝望，憎恨和背叛自己的物种， 甚至将消灭包括自己和子孙在内的人类作为最高理想，这是地球三体 运动最令人震惊之处。 地球三体叛军被称为精神贵族组织，其成员多来自高级知识阶层， 也有相当一部分政界和经济界的精英。三体组织也曾试图在普通民众 中发展成员，但这些努力都告失败。对于人类的负面，普通人并没有高 级知识阶层那样全面深刻的认知；更重要的是，由于他们的思想受现代 科学和哲学影响较少，对自己所属物种本能的认同感仍占强势地位，将 人类作为一个整体来背叛，在他们看来是不可想象的。但知识精英们则 不同，他们中相当多的人早已站在人类之外思考问题了。人类文明，终 于在自己的内部孕育出了强大的异化力量。 三体叛军发展的速度固然惊人，但仅凭人数还不能衡量其力量，因 为它的组织成员大部分处于社会的高层位置，有很大的权力和影响力。 作为地球三体叛军的最高统帅，叶文洁只是一名精神领袖，并不参 与组织的具体运作，她不知道后来变得十分庞大的三体叛军是如何发 展起来的，甚至不知道组织的具体人数。 对于地球三体叛军，各国政府一直没有给予足够的重视。为了迅速 扩大，这个组织几乎是在半公开地活动，他们知道，有一样东西会成为 他们的天然保护，那就是政府的保守和贫乏的想象力。在掌握国家力量 的相关部门中，没有人相信他们说的那一套，只是将他们作为一般的胡 言乱语的激进组织，由于其成员层次之高，各国政府对待这个组织一直 中国科幻基石丛书 240 小心翼翼。直到三体叛军开始发展自己的武装力量，一些国家的安全机 构才注意到它，进而发现该组织非同寻常；至于开始对其进行有效打 击，只是近两年的事。 地球三体叛军并非铁板一块，它的内部有着复杂的派别和分支，主 要分为两部分： 降临派：这是三体叛军最本原最纯粹的一脉，主要由伊文斯物种共 产主义的信奉者组成。他们对人类本性都已彻底绝望，这种绝望最初来 源于现代文明导致的地球物种大灭绝，伊文斯就是其典型代表。后来， 降临派对人类的憎恨开始有了不同的出发点，并非只局限于环保和战 争等，有些上升到了相当抽象的哲学高度。与后来人们的想象不同，这 些人大都是现实主义者，对于他们为之服务的外星文明也并未抱太多 的期望，他们的背叛只源于对人类的绝望和仇恨，麦克伊文斯的一句 话已成为降临派的座右铭：我们不知道外星文明是什么样子，但知道人 类。 拯救派：这是在三体叛军出现相当长的时间后才产生的一个派别， 它本质上是一个宗教团体，由三体教的教徒组成。 人类之外的另一个文明，对于高级知识阶层无疑具有巨大的吸引 力，并使他们极易对其产生种种美好的幻想。对于人类这样一个幼稚的 文明，更高等的异种文明产生的吸引力几乎是不可抗拒的。有一个不太 恰当的比喻：人类文明一直是一个孤独行走于宇宙荒漠中的不谙世事 的少年，现在她（他）知道了另一个异性的存在，虽然看不到他（她）的 面容和身影，但知道他（她）就在远方，对他（她）的美好想象便如同野 火般蔓延。渐渐地，随着对那个遥远文明的想象越来越丰富，拯救派在 精神上对三体文明产生了宗教感情，人马座三星成了太空中的奥林匹 斯山，那是神的住所，三体教由此诞生。与人类的其他宗教不同，三体教 崇拜着一个真实存在的对象；与其他宗教相反，处于危难中的是主，而 负有拯救责任的是信徒。 向社会传播三体文化的途径主要是通过《三体》游戏。三体叛军投 地球往事 三体 241 入巨大的力量开发这款规模庞大的游戏软件，最初的目的，一是三体教 的一种传教手段；二是想通过它将一直局限于高知阶层的三体叛军的 触角伸向社会的最基层，为组织招募处于社会中下层的更年轻的成员。 游戏通过一层貌似人类社会和历史的外壳，演绎三体世界的历史和文 化，这样可以避免入门者的陌生感。当游戏玩家深入到一定程度并感受 三体文明的魅力后，三体组织将直接与其联系，考察其思想倾向，最终 将合格者招募为地球三体叛军成员。但《三体》游戏在社会上并没有引 起太大的关注，玩这个游戏需要层次很高的知识背景和深刻的思想，年 轻的玩家们没有能力和耐心去透过它那看似平常的表层，发现其震撼 人心的内幕。真正被它所吸引的，大多还是高知阶层的人。 拯救派后来加入的成员，大多都是通过《三体》游戏认识三体文 明，最终投身于地球三体叛军的，可以说， 《三体》游戏是拯救派的摇 篮。 拯救派在对三体文明抱有宗教感情的同时，对于人类文明的态度 远没有降临派那样极端，他们的最终理想就是拯救主。为了使主生存下 去，可以在一定程度上牺牲人类世界。但他们中的大多数人认为，能够 使主在三个太阳的半人马座星系生存下去，避免其对太阳系的入侵，是 两全其美的理想结局。他们天真地以为，解决物理上的三体问题就能达 到这一目标，同时拯救三体和地球两个世界。其实这一想法也未必天 真，三体文明本身在相当漫长的时间里也抱有这个想法，解决三体问题 的努力贯穿于三体文明的几百次轮回之中。拯救派中有较深物理学和 数学背景的人，都有过解决三体问题的尝试，即使在得知三体问题从数 学本质上不可解后，仍然没有停止努力，解决三体问题的努力已成为三 体教的一种宗教仪式。虽然拯救派中不乏一流的物理学家和数学家，但 这种研究一直没有重大成果，倒是像魏成这样与三体叛军和三体教无 关的天才，无意中取得了令他们产生很大希望的突破。 降临派和拯救派一直处于尖锐的对立状态，降临派认为，拯救派是 对地球三体运动重大的威胁。这种看法也不是没有道理，正是通过拯救 中国科幻基石丛书 242 派中一些有责任心的人士，各国政府才逐渐得知三体叛军令人震惊的 背景。两派在组织中实力相当，双方的武装力量已经发展到兵戎相见的 程度。叶文洁运用自己的威信极力弥合组织中的裂痕，但效果不大。 随着三体运动的发展，三体叛军中出现了第三个派别：幸存派。当 入侵太阳系的外星舰队的存在被确切证实后，在那场终极战争中幸存 下来是人们最自然的愿望。当然，战争是四百五十年之后的事了，与自 己的此生无关，但很多人希望如果人类战败，自己在四个半世纪后的子 孙能幸存下来。现在就为三体侵略者服务，显然有利于这个目标的实 现。与另外两个主流派别比较，幸存派成员都来自较低的社会阶层，且 东方人（特别是中国人）居多，他们目前的数量还很少，但人数在急剧 增长，在三体文化日益普及的未来，将会成为一支不可忽视的力量。 人类文明自身缺陷产生的异化力量、对更高等文明的向往和崇拜、 让子孙在终极战争后幸存的强烈欲望，这三股强大的动力推动地球三 体运动迅速发展，当它被察觉时，已成燎原之势。 而这时，外星文明还远在四光年之外的太空深处，与人类世界还隔 着四个半世纪的漫漫航程，它们送到地球的，只有那一束电波。 比尔马修的“接触符号”理论，得到了令人心悸的完美证实。,"2 9 T h e E a r t h - T r i s o l a r i s M o v e m e n t The mo st surprising aspect of t he Earth-T risolaris Movement was that so many pe ople had abandoned all hope in human civilization, hated and were willing t o betray their own speci es, and even cherished as their highest ideal the elimination of the entire human race, including themselves and their children. The ET O was called an or ganization of spiritual nobles. Most members came fro m the highly educated classes, and many were elites of the political and financial spheres. The ET O had once tried to develop membership among t he comm on people, but these ef forts all failed. The ET O concluded that the common people did not seem to have the comprehensive and deep understanding o f the highly educ ated about the dark side of humanity . More importantly , bec ause their thoughts were not as deeply influenced by modern science and philosophy , they still felt an overwhelming, instinctual identification wi th their own sp ecies. T o betray the human race as a whole was unimaginab le for them. But intellectual elites were dif ferent: Most of them ha d already begun to con sider issues from a perspective outside the human r ace. Hu man civilization had finally given birth to a stro ng force of alienation. As astounding as the speed of the ET O’ s growth had been, the number of mem bers did not tell the whole story of the ET O’ s strength. Because most of its members had high social status, they held a lot of power and influence.As commander in chief of the ET O rebels, Y e was only their spiritual leader . S he did not participate in the details of the or ganization’ s operation, didn’ t know how the ET O grew so lar ge, and wasn’ t even aware of the exact number of members. In o rder to grow fast, the or ganization operated semi-openly , but the governments of the world never paid much attention to the ET O. The ET O knew that they would be protected by the governments’ conservatism and lack of imagination. In those or gans wielding the powers of the state, no one took the ET O’ s proclamations seriously , thinking that they were like other extremists who spewed nonsense. And because of its mem bers’ social status, governments always treated it carefully . By the time it was recognized as a threat, the rebels were already everywhere. It was only when th e ET O began to develop an armed force that some natio nal security or gans b egan to notice it and realized how unusual it was. Consequently , it was only within the last two years that they had begun to attack the ET O ef fectively . The members of the ET O were not of a single mind. W i thin the or ganization were complicated factions and divisions of opinion. Mainly , they fell into two factions. The Adventist group was the pu rest, most fundamentalist stran d of the ET O, comprised mainly of believers in Evans’ s Pan-Species Communism. They had completely given up hope in human nature. This despair began with the mass extinctions of the Earth’ s species caused by modern civilization. Later , other Advent ists based their hatred of the human race on other foundation s, not limited to issues such as the environment or warfare. Some raised their hatred to very abstract, philosophical levels. Unlike how they wo uld be imagined later , m ost of them were realists, and did not place too muc h hope in the alien civilization they served either . Their betrayal was based only on their despair and hatred of the human race. Mike Evans gave the Adventists their mo tto: W e don’ t know what extraterrestrial civilization is like, but we know humanity . The Redemptionists didn’ t appear until long after the ET O’ s founding. This group’ s nature was a religious or ganization, and the members were believers in the T risolaran faith. A ci vilization outside the huma n race would doubtlessly greatly attract the highly educated classes, an d it was easy for them to de velop manybeautiful fantasies about such a civilization. The human race w as a nave species, and the attraction posed by a more advanced alien civilization was almost irresistible. T o make an imperfect analogy: Human civilization was like a young, unworldly person walking alone across the desert of the universe, who has found out about the existence of a potential lover . Though the person could not see the potential lover ’ s face or figure, the knowledge that the other person existed somewhere in the distance created lovely fantasies about the potential lover that spread like wildfire. Gradually , as fantasies about th at distant civilization grew more and more elaborate, the Redemptionists developed spiritual feelings toward T risolaran civilization. Alpha Centauri bec ame Mount Olympus in space, the dwelling place of the god s; and so the T risolaran religionwhich really had nothing to do with religi on on T risolariswas born. Unlike other human religions, they worshipped something tha t truly existed. Also unlike other human religions, it was the Lord who was in crisis, and the duty of salv ation fell on the shoulders of the believer . The main path of spreading T ris olaran culture to society was th e Thr ee Body game. The ET O invested enormous ef fort to develop this m assive piece of software. The initial goals were twofold: one, to proselytize the T risolaran religi on; and two, to allow the tentacles of the ET O to spread from the highly educated intelligentsia to the lower social strata , and recruit younger ET O members from the middle and lower classes. Using a shell that drew elemen ts from human society and his tory , the game explained the culture and history of T risolaris, thus avoiding alienating begin ners. Once a pla yer had advanced to a certain level and had begun to appreciate T risolaran civilization, the ET O would establish contact, examine the player ’ s sympathies, and finally recruit those who passed the tests to be members of the ET O. But Thr ee Body didn’ t attract much no tice, because the game required too much background knowledge and in-depth thinking, and mos t young players didn’ t have the patience or skill to discover the shocking truth beneath its apparently common surface. Those who were attracted by it were still mostly intellectuals. Most of those who became R edemptionists got to know T risolaran civilization throu gh the Thr ee Body game, and so Thr ee Body could be said to be the cradle of the Redemptionists.While the Redemptionists d eveloped religious feelings toward T risolaran civili zation, they were also not as extreme as the Adventists in their attitude toward human civ ilization. Their ultimate ideal was to save the Lord. In ord er to allow the Lord to continue to exist, they w ere willing to sacrifice the human world to some degree. But most of them believed that the ideal solution would be to find a way to allow the Lord to continue to live in the T risolaris stellar system and avoid the invasion of the Earth. Navely , they believed that solving the three-body problem would achieve this goal, saving both T risolari s and the Earth. Admittedly , p erhaps this thought wasn’ t all that nave. T risolaran civilization itself had thought so through many eons. The ef fort to solve the three-body problem was a thread that ran through several hundreds of cycles of T risolaran civilization. Most Redemptionists with some in-depth math and physics knowledge had attempted the three-body proble m, and even after knowing that the problem was mathematically unsolvable as posed, the ef fort did not cease, because solving the three-body problem had become a religious ritual of their faith. Even though the Redemptionists had many first-class physicists and mathematicians, research in this area never yielded any important results. It took someone like W ei Cheng, a prodigy who had no connection to the ET O or the T risolaran faith, to a ccidentally come up with a brea kthrough in which the Redemptionists placed much hope. The Adventists and the Redemptionists were always in sharp conflict. The Adventists believed that the Redemptionists were the greatest threat to the ET O. This view wasn’ t without reason: It was only thr ough some Redemptionists who had a sense of duty that the governments of the world gradually came to understand th e shocking background of the ET O rebels. The two factions were of a pproximately equal strength within the or ganization, an d the armed for ces of both had developed to the point of starting a civil w ar . Y e W enjie used her authority and reputation to try to patch over the division between the two, but the result was never ideal. As t he ET O mo vement continued to develop, a third faction a ppeared: the Survivors. After confirming the existence of the alien invasion fleet, surviving that war became a most natural human desire. Of course, that war wouldn’ t occur for another 450 years, and had nothing to do with those living today , but many people h oped that if humans did lose, at least their descendants wh o were alive in four and a half centuries could live on.Serving the T risolaran invaders would clearly help with this goal. Compared to the other two factions, the Survivors tended to come from the lower so cial classes, and most were from the East, and especially from China. Their numbers were stil l small, but they were growing rapidly . As T risolaran culture continued to spread, they would become a force that could not be ignored in the future. The ET O members’ alienation developed variously from the faults of human c ivilization itself, the yearning and adoration for a more advanced civilization, and the strong desire for one’ s descendants to survi ve that final war . These three powerful motiv es propelled the ET O movement to develop rapidly . By t hen, the ext raterrestrial civilization was still in the depths o f space, more than four light-years away , separated from the human world by a long journey of four and a half cent uries. The only thing they had sent to the Earth was a radio transmission. Bill Mathers’ s “contact as symbol” theory thus received chillingly perfect confirmation."
地球往事 三体 243 31．两个质子 审问者：现在开始今天的调查。希望你能像上次一样配合。 叶文洁：我知道的你们都知道了，有许多事情反而需要你来告诉 我。 审问者：不是这样，我们首先想知道的是，在三体世界发往地球的 信息中，降临派所截留的那部分内容是什么？ 叶文洁：不知道，他们的组织很严密，我只知道他们截留了信息。 审问者：我们换个话题：在与三体世界的通讯被降临派垄断之后， 你是否建立了第三红岸基地？ 叶文洁：有这个计划，但只完成了接收部分，然后建设停止，设备和 基地也都拆除了。 审问者：为什么？ 叶文洁：因为半人马座三星方向已没有任何信息传来，在所有频段 上都没有。我想你们已经证实了这个。 审问者：是的，这就是说，至少在四年前，三体世界已经停止了与地 球的联系，这也就使得那批被降临派截留的信息更加重要。 叶文洁：是的，在这方面我真没什么可说的了。 审问者： （停顿几秒钟）那我们找一个可谈的话题吧：麦克伊文斯 欺骗了你，是吗？ 叶文洁：可以这么说。他从来没有向我袒露过自己内心最深处的真 实想法，只是表达了自己对地球其他物种的使命感。我没有想到由这种 使命产生的对人类的憎恨已发展到这种极端的程度，以至于他把毁灭 中国科幻基石丛书 244 人类文明作为自己的最终理想。 审问者：看看地球三体组织现在的局面：降临派要借助外星力量毁 灭人类，拯救派把外星文明当神来崇拜，幸存派的理想是以出卖同胞来 苟且偷生，所有这些都与你借助外星文明改造人类的理想不一致。 叶文洁：我点燃了火，却控制不了它。 审问者：你有在三体组织内部消灭降临派的计划，并开始对降临派 采取行动。但“审判日”号是降临派的核心基地和指挥中心，伊文斯等 降临派的核心人物常驻其上，你们为什么不首先攻击这艘巨轮呢？拯救 派的武装力量大部分忠于你，是有能力击沉甚至占领它的。 叶文洁：为了被截留的主的信息。那些信息都存贮在第二红岸基 地，也就是“审判日”号的某台计算机上，如果攻击那艘船，降临派就会 在他们认为危急的时刻删除所有信息，那些信息太重要了，我们不能失 去它。对于拯救派而言，信息的丢失如同基督教丢失了圣经、伊斯兰 教丢失了古兰经。我想，你们也面临着同样的问题，降临派把主的信 息当“人质” ，这就是“审判日”号现在仍然存在的原因。 审问者：这方面，你对我们有什么建议吗？ 叶文洁：没有。 审问者：你把三体世界也称为主，是否意味着你对三体世界也产生 了像拯救派那样的宗教感情，或者，你已经皈依了三体教？ 叶文洁：没有，只是习惯而已……我不想再谈这个问题了。 审问者：那我们回到被截留的信息上来吧。也许你真的不知道其详 细内容，但某些方面，某些大概的东西，总有所闻吧？ 叶文洁：可能只是些谣传。 审问者：比如？ 叶文洁：…… 审问者：三体世界是否向降临派传授了某些高于人类现有科技水平 的技术？ 叶文洁：不太可能，因为那些技术很可能会落到你们手里。 地球往事 三体 245 审问者：最后一个问题，也是最重要的：迄今为止，三体世界发送到 地球的只有电波吗？ 叶文洁：几乎是的。 审问者：几乎？ 叶文洁：现在这一轮三体文明，宇宙航行速度达到光速的十分之 一，这个技术飞跃发生在几十个地球年前，这之前他们的宇航速度一直 徘徊在光速的几千分之一，他们向地球发射的小型探测器，现在还没走 完半人马座与太阳系之间的距离的百分之一。 审问者：这里有一个问题：已经出发的三体舰队如果以十分之一光 速航行，四十年后就应该到达太阳系，但为什么你们说需要四百年呢？ 叶文洁：确实如此。由大型宇宙飞船组成的三体星际舰队质量巨 大，加速十分缓慢，十分之一光速只是它们能够达到的最高速度，在这 个速度上只能巡航很短的时间，就要开始减速。另外，三体飞船推进的 动力是正反物质的湮灭，飞船前方有一个巨大的磁力场，形成一个漏斗 形的磁罩，用于收集太空中的反物质粒子，这种收集过程十分缓慢，经 过相当长的时间，才能得到供飞船进行一段时间加速的反物质数量，因 此舰队的加速是间断进行的，很长时间的收集后才能进行一次。所以， 三体舰队到达太阳系所需的时间是小型探测器的十倍。 审问者：那你刚才说的“几乎”是什么意思？ 叶文洁：关于宇宙航行的速度，我们是在一个限定范围内讨论的， 离开了这个范围，即使是落后的人类，也已经能将一些物质实体加速到 接近光速了。 审问者（稍顿） ：你所指的限定范围，是不是指宏观范围？在微观 上，人类已经可以使用高能加速器，将微观粒子加速到接近光速，微观 粒子就是你说的那些物质实体吧？ 叶文洁：您很聪明。 审问者（指指耳机） ：我背后有世界上最出色的专家。 叶文洁：是的，是微观粒子。六年前，在遥远的半人马座星系，三体 中国科幻基石丛书 246 世界曾将两个氢原子核加速到接近光速，并向太阳系发射，这两个氢 核，也就是质子，在两年前到达了太阳系，然后到达了地球。 审问者：两个质子？他们只送来了两个质子？这几乎等于什么都没 送来嘛。 叶文洁（笑） ：您也说“几乎”了。三体世界只有这个能力，只能使 质子这么大小的东西接近光速，所以在四光年的距离上，他们只能送来 两个质子。 审问者：在宏观世界，两个质子就等于什么都没有 即使是一个 细菌的一根毛发，也包含着几十亿个质子。这有什么意义？ 叶文洁：它是一把锁。 审问者：锁？锁什么？ 叶文洁：锁死人类的科学，在三体舰队到达前的四个半世纪，因为 这两个质子的存在，人类的科学将不可能有任何重大进展。据传伊文斯 说过这样的话：两个质子到达地球之日，就是人类科学死亡之时。 审问者：这未免太离奇了吧，怎么做到呢？ 叶文洁：不知道，我真的不知道。在三体文明眼中，我们可能连野 蛮人都算不上，只是一堆虫子。 汪淼和丁仪走出作战中心时已近午夜，他们刚刚监听了上面的对 话。 “你相信叶文洁说的吗？ ”汪淼问。 “你呢，信吗？ ” “最近有些事情确实太不可思议了，但，用两个质子锁死全人类的 科学？这也……” “首先注意一点：三体文明从半人马座三星向地球发射了两个质 子，竟都到达了地球！从四光年外？这也瞄得太准了，漫长的途中有数不 清的干扰，星际尘埃什么的，太阳系和地球都在运动中，这比从冥王星 上开枪击中这里的一只蚊子都准确，真是个不可思议的射手。 ” 地球往事 三体 247 听到“射手”一词，汪淼的心不由紧了一下。 “这说明什么？ ” “不知道。在你的印象中，质子、中子和电子这样的微观粒子，是个 什么样子？ ” “几乎是一个点，当然这个点是有结构的。 ” “很幸运，我印象中的图像比你要真实些。 ”丁仪说着，把手中抽尽 的烟蒂扔向远处， “看那是什么？ ”他指着落到地上的烟蒂问。 “香烟过滤嘴。 ” “很好，从这个距离看那个小东西，是什么？ ” “差不多也就是一个点。 ” “对。 ”丁仪走过去把过滤嘴拾起来，在汪淼眼皮底下将它撕开，露 出里面已由白变黄的海绵丝，汪淼闻到了一股焦油味。丁仪接着说， “你看，就这么个小玩意儿，它的吸附面积如果展开来，有一间客厅那 么大。 ”他说着一扬手又将过滤嘴扔掉， “用烟斗吗？ ” “我什么烟都不抽了。 ” “烟斗使用另一种更高级的过滤芯，三块钱一个，直径与香烟过滤 嘴差不多，但比它长些，是一个装着活性炭的小纸筒，把里面的活性炭 倒出来，也就是一小撮像老鼠屎似的黑炭粒，但它们内部微孔构成的吸 附面积，展开来有一个网球场这么大，这就是活性炭具有超强吸附性的 原因。 ” “你想说什么？”汪淼很注意地听着。 “过滤嘴中的海绵或活性炭是三维体，它们的吸附面则是二维的， 由此可见，一个微小的高维结构可以存贮何等巨量的低维结构。但在宏 观世界，高维空间对低维空间的容纳也就到此为止了，因为上帝很吝 啬，在创世大爆炸中只给了宏观宇宙三个维度。但这不等于更高的维度 不存在，有多达八个维度被禁锢在微观中，加上宏观的三维，在基本粒 子中，存在着十一维的空间。 ” “那又如何？ ” “我只想说明以下的事实：在宇宙间，一个技术文明等级的重要标 中国科幻基石丛书 248 志，是它能够控制和使用的微观维度。对于基本粒子的一维使用，从我 们那些长毛裸体的祖先在山洞中生起篝火时就开始了，对化学反应的 控制，就是在一维层次上操控微观粒子。当然，这种控制也是从低级到 高级，从篝火到后来的蒸汽机，再到后来的发电机；现在，人类对微观粒 子一维控制的水平已达到了顶峰，有了计算机，也有了你们的纳米材 料。但这一切，都局限于对微观维度的一维控制，在宇宙间一个更高级 的文明看来，篝火和计算机、纳米材料等等是没有本质区别的，同属于 一个层次，这也是他们仍将人类看成虫子的原因遗憾的是，他们是 对的。 ” “你能不能说得更具体些，这一切与那两个质子有什么关系？说到 底，到达地球的这两个质子能做什么呢？正如刚才那人所说，细菌的一 根汗毛中，都可能包含着几十亿个质子，这两个质子就是在我的指尖上 百分之百变成能量，我最多也只能感到像被针扎了一下。 ” “感觉不到的，它们就是在细菌的手指尖上全部转化成能量，那个 细菌也未必能感到什么。 ” “那你刚才想说什么？ ” “没想说什么，我什么都不知道，一个虫子能知道什么？ ” “可你是个虫子中的物理学家，知道的总比我多，对这事，你至少 没像我这样茫然。就算我求你了，要不今晚我睡不好觉的。 ” “我要是说得多了，你怕是更睡不好。算了，操这份心有什么用？我 们应该学习魏成和大史他们的达观，干好自己的事儿就行了。走，我们 去喝点儿，然后回去睡个虫子的好觉吧。 ”,"3 0 T w o P r o t o n s INTERROGA T OR: W e will now begin today’ s investigation. W e hope you’ll cooperate again as you did last time. YE WENJIE: Y ou already know everything I know . In fact, by now there are many things that I’d like to learn from you. INTERROGA T OR: I d on’ t think y ou’ve told us everything. First, we want to know th is: Amo ng the messages that T risolaris sent to Earth, what were the contents of those portion s that the Adventists intercepted and withheld? YE: I can’ t tell you . They have a tight or ganization. I only know that they did withhold some messages. INTERROGA T OR: Ch ange of subject. After th e Adventists monopolized communications with T risolaris, did you build a third Red Coast Base? YE: I did have such a plan. Bu t we only built a receiver , and then construction stopped. The equipment and the base were all dismantled. INTERROGA T OR: Why? YE: B ecaus e there were no more messages coming from Alpha C entauri. There w as nothing on any frequ ency . I think you’ve already confirmed this. INTERROGA T OR: Y es. In other wordsat least as of four years ago T risolaris decided to terminate all communications with Earth. This makes the messages intercepted by the Adventists even more important. YE: T rue. But there’ s really nothing more I can tell you about them.INTERROGA T OR: (pausing a few seconds) T hen let’ s find some topic wh ere you can tell me more. Mike Evans lied to you, is that right? YE: Y ou could put i t that way . He never revealed to me the thoughts buried deep in his hear t, and only expressed his sense of duty toward the other species on this p lanet. I never realized that this sense of duty ha d caused his hatred of hu man civilization to develop to such extremes that he could make the destruction of the human race his ultimate ideal. INTERROGA T OR: Let ’ s look at the current composition of the ET O. The Adventists woul d like to destro y the human race by means of an alien power; the Redemptionists wor ship the alien civilization as a god; the Survivors wish to betray other humans to buy their own survival. None of th ese is in line with your ori ginal ideal of using the alien civilization as a way to reform humanity . YE: I started the fire, but I couldn’ t control how it burnt. INTERROGA T OR: Y ou had a plan to eliminate the Adventists from within the ET O, and you even began to implement this plan. But Judgment Day is the c ore base an d command center for the Adventists, and Mi ke Evans and other Adventist leaders usu ally reside there. Why didn’ t y ou attack the ship first? Most of the armed forces of the Redemptionists are loyal to you, and you should have enough firepower to sink it or capture it. YE: It ’ s because of the messages f rom the Lord that they interce pted. All those m essages are stored in the Second Red Coast Base, on some computer on Judgment Day . If we attacked that ship, the Adventists could erase all t he messages when they realized that loss was i mminent. Those m essages are too important for us to risk losing them. For Redemptionists, losing those messages would be as if Christians lost the Bible or Muslims lost the Kora n. I think you are faced with the same problem. The Adventists are holding the Lord’ s messages hostage, and that is why Judgment Day has remained unmolested so far . INTERROGA T OR: Do you have any advice for us? YE: No. INTERROGA T OR: Y ou also call T risolaris your “Lord.” Does this mean that you’ve also developed religious feelings for T risolaris like the Redemptionists? Are you already a follower of the T risolaran faith? YE: Not at all. It’ s just a habit.… I do not wish to discuss it further .INTERROGA T OR: Let ’ s get back to those intercepted messages. Maybe you don’ t kn ow the exact contents, but surely you must have heard r umors of some of the details? YE: Probably only baseless rumors. INTERROGA T OR: Such as? YE: … INTERROGA T OR: D id T risolaris transfer certain technologies to the Adventists, technologies more advanced than current human technology? YE: Not likely . Because such technology would risk falling into your hands. INTERROGA T OR: One last question, and also the most important: Until now , has T risolaris sent only radio waves to the Earth? YE: Almost true. INTERROGA T OR: Almost? YE: T he current T ris olaran civilization is capable of space travel at o ne-tenth the spee d of light. This technology leap occurred a few decades ago in Earth years. Before that point, their maximum speed had hovered around one-thousandth the speed of light. The tiny probes that they sent to the Earth ha ve not even completed one-hundredth of the journey between there and here. INTERROGA T OR: The n I have a question. If the T risolaran Fleet that had been launched is capable of flight at one-tenth the speed of light, it sh ould take only forty years to reach the s olar system. So why do you say that it would take more than four hundred years? YE: H ere’ s the thi ng. The T risolaran Interstellar Fleet is composed of incredibly massive spaceships. Accelerating them is a slow process. One- tenth the speed of light is only their maximum speed, but the y cannot cruise a t this speed for long before decelerating as they appr oach the Earth. Also, the source of propulsion for the T risolaran ships is matter - antimatter annihilation. In fron t of each ship is a lar ge magn etic field shaped like a f unnel to collect antimatter particles from space. This collection proce ss is slow , and only after a long wait can it gather enough antimatter to allow the ship to accelerate for a brief period. T hus, the fleet’ s acceleration occurs in spurts, interspersed by long periods of coasting to collect fuel. This is w hy the time it takes the T risolaran Fleet to reach the sol ar system is ten times longer than the flight time of a small probe.INTERROGA T OR: Then what did you mean by “almost” just now? YE: W e’re talking about the speed of space flight within a certain context. Outside this context, even backward human beings are capable of accelerating certain objects to close to the speed of light. INTERROGA T OR: (a pause) By “context,” do you mean at the macro scale? At a m icro scale, h umans can already use high-ener gy particle acc elerators to speed up subatomic particles to near the speed of light. These particles are the “objects” you meant, correct? YE: Y ou’re very clever . INTERROGA T OR: (points to his earpiece) I have the world’ s foremost scientists behind me. YE: Y es , I meant su batomic particle s. Six years ago, in the distant T risolaran stellar system, T risolaris accelerated two hydrogen nuclei to near the speed of light and shot them toward the solar system. These two hydrogen nuclei, or protons, arrived at the solar system two years ago, then reached the Earth. INTERROGA T OR: T w o protons? They only sent two protons? That’ s almost nothing. YE: (laughs) Y ou also said “almost.” That’ s the limit of T risolaran power . They can only accelerate something as small as a proton to near the speed of light. So over a distance of four light-years, they can only send two protons. INTERROGA T OR: At the macroscopic level, two protons are nothing. Even a single c ilium on a bacterium would include several billion protons. What’ s the point? YE: They’re a lock. INTERROGA T OR: A lock? What are they locking? YE: T hey are sealing of f the prog ress of human science. Because of the existence of these two protons, humanity will not be able to m ake any important scient ific developmen ts during the four and a half centuries until the arrival of the T risolara n Fleet. Evans once said that the day of arrival of the two protons was also the day that human science died. INTERROGA T OR: That’ s … too fantastic. How can that be? YE: I don’ t know . I really don’ t know . In the eyes of T risolaran civilization, we’re probably not even primitive savages. W e might be mere bugs.* * * It wa s ne ar midn ight by the time W ang Miao and Ding Y i walked out of the Battle Command Center . They had been invited to listen to Y e’ s interrogation due to W ang’ s involvement in the case and Ding Y i’ s connection to Y e’ s daughter . “Do you believe what Y e W enjie said?” W ang asked. “Do you?” “Many things that have happen ed recently are incredible. But for two protons to block all progress of human science? That seems…” “Let’ s fo cus on one thing first. The T risolarans were able to sh oot two protons at the E arth from four l ight-years away and they both reached the tar get! That accuracy is incredib le! There are numerous obstacles between there an d here: interstellar dust, for example. And both the solar system and the Eart h are moving. It woul d require more precision than shooting a mosquito here from Pluto. The shooter is beyond imagination.” W ang’ s heart clenched when he heard “shooter .” “What do you think this means?” “I don’ t know . I n your impression, what do subatomic particles such as neutrons and protons look like?” “They would just look like a point. Though the point has internal structure.” “Luckily , the image in my head is more realistic than yours.” As Ding spoke, he tossed his cigarette b utt away . “What do you think that is?” He pointed at the butt. “A cigarette filter .” “Good. Looking at that tiny thing from this distance, how would you describe it?” “It’ s practically just a point.” “Right.” Ding walked over and picked up the butt. In front of W ang’ s eyes he tore it open and revealed the yellowed spongy mat erial inside. W ang sm elled burnt tar . Ding continued, “Look, if you spread this little thing open, the adsorbent surface area can be as lar ge as a living room.” He tossed the filter away . “Do you smoke pipes?” “I no longer smoke anything.”“Pipes u se anot her type of mor e advanced filter . Y ou can get one for three yuan. The diameter is about the same as a cigarette filter , but it’ s longer: a small paper tube filled with active charcoal. If you take out all the active ch arcoal, it will look like a little pile of black particles, like mouse droppings. But added together , the adsorbent surface formed by the tiny holes in side is as lar ge as a tennis court. This is why active charcoal is so adsorbent.” “What are you trying to say?” W ang asked, listening intently . “The sponge or active charcoal i nside a filter is three-dimensional. Their adsorbent surfaces, however , are two-dimensional. Thus, you can see how a tiny high-dimen sional structur e can contain a huge low-dimensional structure. But at the macroscopi c level, this is about the limit of the ability for high-dimensional space to contain low-dimensional space. Because God was stingy , during the big bang He only provided the macros copic world with three spatial dimensions, plus the dimension of time. But this doesn’ t mean th at higher dimensions don’ t exist. Up to seven additional dimensions are l ocked within the micro sca le, or , more precisely , within t he quantum realm. And added to the four d imensions at the macro scale, fundamental particles exist within an eleven-dimensional space-time.” “So what?” “I ju st w ant to point out this fac t: In the universe, an important mark of a c iviliz ation’ s technological adv ancement is its ability to control and make use of micro dimensions. Making use of fundamental particles without taking advantag e of the micro dimensions is something that our naked, hairy ancestors already began back when they lit bonfires within caves. Controlling chemical reactions is just manipulating micro particles without regard to the micro dimensions. Of course, this control also progressed from crude to advanced: from bonfires to steam engines, and then generators. Now , the ability for humans to manipulate micro particles at the macro level has reached a pe ak: W e have computers and nanomaterials. But all of that is accomplished without unlocking the many micro dimensions. From the perspective of a more advanced civilization in the universe, bonfires and computers and nanomaterials are not fundamentally dif ferent. They all belong to the sam e level. That’ s also why they still think of humans as mere bugs. Unfortunately , I think they’re right.”“Can yo u be more specific? What does all this have to do with those two pro tons? Ultimately , what can the two protons that have reached the Earth do ? Like the interrogator said, a single cilium on a ba cterium can contain several billion protons. Even if these two protons turned entirely into ener gy on the tip of my finger , at most it would feel like a pinprick.” “Y ou wouldn’ t feel anything. Even if they turned into ener gy on a bacterium, the bacterium probably wouldn’ t feel anything.” “Then what were you trying to say?” “Nothing. I don’ t know anything. What can a bug know?” “But you ’re a physicist among bugs. Y ou know more than I do. At least you aren’ t completely at a loss when faced with the knowledge of these protons. I beg you. T ell me. Otherwise I won’ t be able to sleep tonight.” “If I tell you more, you really w on’ t be able to sleep. For get it. What’ s the point of wor rying? W e should learn to be as philosophical as W ei Cheng and Shi Qiang. Just do the best within your responsibility . Let’ s go drinking and then go back to sleep like good bugs.”"
地球往事 三体 249 32．古筝行动 “没关系，我已经没有放射性了。 ”史强对坐在旁边的汪淼说， “这 两天，我让人家像洗面口袋似的翻出来洗了个遍。这次会议本来没安排 你参加，是我坚决要求请你来的，嘿，咱哥俩这次保准能出风头。 ” 史强说着，从会议桌上的烟灰缸中拣出一只雪茄屁股，点上后抽一 口，点点头，心旷神怡地把烟徐徐吐到对面与会者的面前，其中就有这 支雪茄的原主人斯坦顿，一名美国海军陆战队上校，他向大史投去鄙夷 的目光。 这次与会的有更多的外国军人，而且都穿上了军装。在人类历史 上，全世界的武装力量第一次面对共同的敌人。 常伟思将军说： “同志们，这次与会的所有人，对目前形势都有了 基本的了解，用大史的话说，信息对等了。人类与外星侵略者的战争已 经开始，虽然在四个半世纪后，我们的子孙才会真正面对来自异星的三 体入侵者，我们现在与之作战的仍是人类；但从本质上讲，这些人类的 背叛者也可以看成来自地球文明之外的敌人，我们是第一次面对这样 的敌人。下一步的作战目标十分明确，就是要夺取‘审判日’号上被截 留的三体信息，这些信息，可能对人类文明的存亡具有重要意义。 “我们还没有惊动‘审判日’号，这艘巨轮目前仍以合法的身份行 驶在大西洋上，它已向巴拿马运河管理局提出申请，将于四天后通过运 河。这是我们采取行动的一次绝好的机会，随着形势的发展，很可能不 会再有这样的机会了。现在，全球的各个作战中心都在制定行动方案， 这些方案将由总部在十小时之内选择并确定一个。我们这次会议的任 中国科幻基石丛书 250 务，就是讨论行动方案，最后确定一至三个最可行的上报总部。各位，时 间很紧，我们必须以最高效率工作。 ” “请注意，所有方案都要确保一点：保证‘审判日’号上三体信息 的安全并夺取到它。 ‘审判日’号是由油轮改装的，船体上层和内部都 增加了复杂的结构，据说即使是船员，在进入不常去的区域时也要凭借 地图认路，我们对其结构的了解就更少了。目前，我们甚至不知道‘审 判日’号计算机中心的确切位置，也不知道被截留的三体信息是否存 贮于计算机中心的服务器上、有几个备份。我们要达到目标的唯一途 径，就是全面占领和控制‘审判日’号，这中间最困难的，就是在攻击行 动中避免敌人删除三体信息。删除这些信息极其容易，敌人在紧急时刻 不太可能进行常规删除，因为以目前的技术很容易恢复，但只需对服务 器硬盘或其他存贮装置打上一梭子，一切就都完了，这前后在十秒钟内 就能完成。而我们，必须在行动被觉察前十秒之内，使存贮装置附近的 敌人失去行动能力。由于存贮装置的位置不明，备份数量也不清楚，所 以必须在极短的时间内，在被目标觉察之前，消灭‘审判日’号上的全 部敌人，同时又不能对其内部的其他设施，特别是计算机设备造成重大 损坏。因此，这次任务十分困难，有人甚至认为是不可能完成的。 ” 一名日本自卫队军官说： “我们认为，唯一可能成功的行动，是借助 于我方潜伏在‘审判日’号内部，并对三体信息的存贮位置熟悉的侦 察人员，在行动前控制或转移存贮设备。 ” 有人问： “对‘审判日’号的监视和侦察一直是由北约军事情报机 构和 CIA 负责的，有这样的潜伏者吗？ ” “没有。 ”北约协调员说。 “那我们后面剩下的，就是扯淡了。 ”大史插上一句，立刻遭到很多 人的白眼。 斯坦顿上校说： “消灭一个封闭结构内部的人员，同时对其中的其他 设施又不造成损坏，我们首先想到的就是球状闪电武器。 ” 丁仪摇摇头： “不行，这种武器已广为人知，我们不知道船体是否 地球往事 三体 251 装备了屏蔽球状闪电的磁场墙；即使没有，球状闪电虽然可以保证消灭 船内的所有人员，但也不能保证同时性；而且，球状闪电进入船体内部 后，可能还要在空中游荡一段时间才会释放能量，这段时间短则十几秒 钟，长就有可能达到一分钟甚至更多，他们完全有时间察觉到袭击并采 取毁灭信息的行动。 ” 斯坦顿上校说： “那么中子弹呢？ ” “上校，您应该知道那也是不行的！ ”一名俄罗斯军官说， “中子辐 射不能瞬间致死，中子弹攻击后，船里敌人剩下的时间够开一次我们这 样的会了。 ” “另一个方案就是神经毒气，但由于其在船内的释放和扩散有一 个过程，也不可能达到将军所说的目标。 ”一名北约军官说。 “剩下的选择就是震荡炸弹和次声波了。 ”斯坦顿上校说，人们都 期待着他的下文，但他却没有接着说出什么来。 大史说： “震荡炸弹是我们警方用的玩意儿， 确实可以一下子把建 筑物里的人震昏，但目前好像只对一两个房间有用。你们有能一次震昏 一船人那么大个儿的吗？ ” 斯坦顿摇摇头， “没有，即使有，那样大的爆炸物也不可能不破坏 船内的设施。 ” “次声波武器呢？ ”有人问。 “还在实验阶段，无法用于实战。特别是那船十分巨大，以现在试 验中的次声波武器的功率，如果对整个‘审判日’号同时攻击，最多也 就是让里面的人头晕恶心而已。 ” “哈， ”大史捻灭抽得只剩下一粒花生大小的雪茄头说， “我说过 剩下的就是扯淡了吧，都扯这么长了，大家记住首长的话：时间紧迫！ ” 他坏笑着转向译员，一名一脸不自在的漂亮女中尉， “不好翻吧同志， 意思到了就行。 ” 但斯坦顿居然似乎听懂了，他用刚刚抽出的一根雪茄指着史强说： “这个警察有什么资格这么对我们讲话？ ” 中国科幻基石丛书 252 “你的资格呢？ ”大史反问。 “斯坦顿上校是资深的特种作战专家，他几乎参加过越战以来所 有的重大军事行动。 ”一名北约军官说。 “那告诉你我的资格：二十多年前，我所在的侦察排，穿插到越军 纵深几十公里，占领了那里的一座严密设防的水电站，阻止了越南人炸 坝阻断我军进攻道路的计划。这就是我的资格：我战胜过打败了你们的 敌人。 ” “够了大史！ ”常伟思拍拍桌子说， “不要扯远了，你可以说出自己 的方案。 ” “我看没必要在这个警察身上浪费时间。 ”斯坦顿上校轻蔑地说， 同时开始点雪茄。 没等译员翻译，大史就跳起来说： “泡立死（ police ） ，我两次听出这 个词了，咋的，看不起警察？要说甩一堆炸弹把那大船炸成碎末，那你们 军人行；但要是从里面完好地取出什么东西，别看你肩上扛着几颗星， 还不如小偷儿。这种事儿，要出邪招，绝对的邪招！这个，你们远比不上 罪犯，他们是出邪招的大师！知道那招儿能邪到什么程度？我办过一个 盗窃案，罪犯能把行驶中的列车中间的一节车厢偷了，前后的其余部分 又完好地接起来开到终点站，用的工具只是一根钢丝绳和几只铁钩子。 这才是特种作战专家！而像我这样儿在基层摸爬滚打了十几年的重案 刑警，受到了他们最好的培养和教育。 ” “说你的方案，否则就不要再发言了！ ”常伟思指着大史说。 “这儿这么多重量级人物，我刚才怕轮不上我，那样老领导您又会 说我这人没礼貌了。 ” “你已经没礼貌到家了！快些，说你的邪招！ ” 史强拿起一支笔，在桌面上画了两条弯曲的平行线， “这是运河， ” 又拿起烟灰缸放到两条线之间， “这是‘审判日’号。 ”然后，他探身越 过桌面，一把扯下了斯坦顿上校刚点燃的雪茄。 “我不能容忍这个白痴了！ ”上校站起来大叫。 地球往事 三体 253 “史强，出去。 ”常伟思厉声说。 “等我说完，就一分钟。 ”大史说着，向斯坦顿伸出另一只手。 “什么？ ”上校不解地问。 “再给我一支。 ” 斯坦顿犹豫了一下，从一个精致的木盒中又拿出一支雪茄递给史 强，后者将第一支雪茄冒烟的一头按到桌面上，使它竖立在桌子上画的 巴拿马运河岸边，将另一支的一头弄平，立到“运河”的另一边。 “在运河两岸立两根柱子，柱子之间平行地扯上许多细丝，间距半 米左右，这些细丝是汪教授他们制造出来的那种叫‘飞刃’的纳米材 料。” 史强说完，站在那里等了几秒钟，举起双手对着还没有反应过来的 人们说： “完了，就这些。 ”说完转身走出了会场。 空气凝固了，所有人像石化般一动不动，连周围电脑的嗡嗡声似乎 都变得小心翼翼。不知过了多久，才有人怯生生地打破沉寂： “汪教授， ‘飞刃’是丝状的吗？ ” 汪淼点点头， “用我们现有的分子建筑技术， 只能生产出丝状的材 料，粗细大约相当于头发丝的十分之一……这些史警官会前向我了解 过。 ” “现有的数量够吗？ ” “运河有多宽？船的高度？ ” “运河最窄处一百五十米， ‘审判日’号高三十一米，吃水八米左 右。” 汪淼盯着桌上的雪茄，粗略计算了一下， “基本上够吧。 ” 又是一阵漫长的沉默，与会者都在试图使自己从震惊中恢复过来。 “如果存贮三体信息的设备，硬盘光盘之类的，也被切割呢？”有人 问。 “几率不大吧。 ” “被切割也问题不大， ”一名计算机专家说， “那种细丝极其锋利， 中国科幻基石丛书 254 切口一定很齐，在这种状态下，无论是硬盘光盘，还是集成电路存贮体， 其中的信息绝大部分都可以恢复。 ” “还有别的更可行的方案吗？”常伟思看看会场，没人说话， “好， 下面就集中讨论这个方案，开始研究细节吧。 ” 一直沉默的斯坦顿上校站了起来， “我去叫警官回来。 ” 常伟思挥挥手示意他坐下，然后喊了一声： “大史！ ”史强走了进 来，带着那一脸坏笑看了看众人，拿起桌上“运河”边上的两支雪茄，把 点过的塞到嘴里，另一支揣进口袋。 有人问： “‘审判日’号通过时，那两根柱子能承受‘飞刃’吗？会 不会柱子首先被割断呢？ ” 汪淼说： “这个能解决，有少量片状的‘飞刃’材料，可以用作细丝 在柱子上固定处的垫片。 ” 下面的讨论主要是在海军军官和航海专家们之间进行了。 “‘审判日’号是巴拿马运河能通过的最大吨位的船只了，吃水很 深，所以还要考虑纳米丝在水下的布设。 ” “水下部分比较困难，如果时间来不及倒是可以放弃，那里主要放 置发动机、燃油和一些压舱物，噪音、震动和干扰都很大，环境恶劣，计 算机中心和类似的机构不太可能设在那个位置。倒是在水上部分，如果 纳米丝的间距再小一些，效果肯定更好。 ” “那在运河的三个船闸之一动手是最好的了， ‘审判日’号是巴拿 马尺型船 ① ，通过时正好填满船闸， ‘飞刃’丝的长度只需 三十二米左 右，间距可以很小，立柱子和拉丝的操作相对也容易些，特别是水下部 分。 ” “不行，船闸处情况复杂，船在闸中要由四台轨道机车牵引通过， 速度很慢，而这时也肯定是‘审判日’号上最警觉的时候，在切割过程 中极有可能被发现。 ” ①为通过巴拿马运河的三十二米宽船闸， 相当一部分大型海轮被设计成三十一米 宽，称为巴拿马尺型。 地球往事 三体 255 “是否可以考虑米拉弗洛莱斯船闸外面的美洲大桥？桥墩就可以 用作拉丝的柱子。 ” “不行，桥墩的间距太宽， ‘飞刃’材料肯定不够的。 ” “那么我们就确定下来，行动位置是盖拉德水道 ① 的最窄处，一百 五十米宽，算上建支柱的余量，按一百七十米吧。 ” 汪淼说： “要这样，拉丝的间距最小就是五十厘米，再小材料不够 了。” “那就是说， ”大史吐出一口烟， “得想法让船白天过运河。 ” “为什么？ ” “夜里船上的人睡觉啊，都是躺着的，五十厘米的空当太大了，白 天他们就是坐着或蹲着，也够了。 ” 响起了零星的几声笑，重压下的人们感到了一丝带着血腥味的轻 松。 “你真是个魔鬼。 ”一位联合国女官员对大史说。 “会伤及无辜吗？”汪淼问，他的声音中带着明显可以听出来的颤 抖。 一名海军军官回答： “过船闸时要有十几名接缆工人上船，不过船 通过后他们就下去了。巴拿马引水员要随船走完八十二公里的运河，肯 定要牺牲掉。 ” 一名 CIA 官员说： “还有‘审判日’号上的一部分船员，他们对这 船是干什么的可能并不知情。 ” “教授，这些事现在不用想，这不是你们要考虑的事情。我们要取 得的信息关系到人类文明的存亡，会有人做出最后决定的。 ”常伟思 说。 散会时，斯坦顿上校把那个精致的雪茄木盒推到史强面前： “警官， 上好的哈瓦纳，送给你了。 ” ①巴拿马运河的主要人工开挖部分，河道狭窄。 中国科幻基石丛书 256 四天后，巴拿马运河盖拉德水道。 汪淼没有一点儿身处异国他乡的感觉。他知道，西面不远处是美丽 的加通湖，东面则是壮丽的美洲大桥和巴拿马城，但他都无缘见到，两 天前他乘坐飞机从国内直接飞到巴拿马城附近的托库门军用机场，然 后就乘直升机直接来到这里。眼前的景色太平常了，正在进行的运河拓 宽工程使两岸山坡上的热带雨林变得稀稀拉拉，坡上露出了大片黄土， 那色彩真的使汪淼感到对这里很熟悉。运河看上去也很普通，可能是因 为在这一段它十分狭窄的缘故。这段水道是在上世纪初由十万人一锹锹 开凿出来的。 汪淼和斯坦顿上校坐在半山坡一座凉亭的躺椅上，两人都穿着宽 大的花衬衣，大草帽扔在一边，看上去就是两个普通的游客。在这个位 置，下面的运河尽收眼底。 就在他们下方的运河两岸上，分别平放着两根二十四米长的钢柱， 五十根一百六十米的超强度纳米丝已经按约零点五米的间距连接在两 根钢柱上，只是每根纳米丝靠右岸的一端还连接了一段普通钢丝，这可 以使纳米丝随着系在上面的坠物沉入河底，这样做是为了让其他的船 只通过。好在运河上的运输并不像汪淼想象的那么繁忙，平均每天只有 四十艘左右的大型船舶通过。两根钢柱的一端都与活动铰结相连，只有 等待“审判日”号前面的最后一艘船通过，才能拉回普通钢丝，把纳米 丝在右岸钢柱上做最后固定，然后钢柱才能立起来。行动的代号是“古 筝” ，这是很自然的联想，而纳米丝构成的切割网则被称为“琴” 。 一小时前， “审判日”号已由加通湖驶入盖拉德水道。 斯坦顿问汪淼以前是否来过巴拿马，汪淼说没有。 “我在 1990 年来过。 ”上校说。 “是那次战争吧？ ” “是，但对我来说是最没有印象的一次战争，只记得在梵蒂冈大使 馆前为被包围的诺列加总统播放杰克逊的摇滚舞曲《无处可逃》 ，那是 我的主意。 ” 地球往事 三体 257 下面的运河中，一艘通体雪白的法国游轮正在缓缓驶过，铺着绿地 毯的甲板上，有几名穿得花花绿绿的游客在闲逛。 “二号观察哨报告，目标前方已没有任何船只。 ”斯坦顿的步话机 响了起来。 “把‘琴’立起来。 ”斯坦顿命令道。 几名头戴安全帽工人模样的人出现在两岸。汪淼站起身来，但上校 拉住了他， “教授，你不用管，他们会干得很好。 ”汪淼看着右岸的人利 索地抽回连接纳米丝的普通钢丝，把已经绷紧的纳米丝在钢柱上固定 好。然后，两岸的人同时拉动几根长钢索，使两根钢柱缓缓竖立起来。为 了伪装，两根钢柱上都挂了一些航标和水位标志。他们干得很从容，甚 至看上去有些懒洋洋的，像是在从事一件平淡乏味的工作。汪淼盯着钢 柱之间的空间看，那里看上去一无所有，但死亡之琴已经就位。 “目标距琴四公里！ ”步话机里的声音说。 斯坦顿放下步话机，又继续刚才的话题： “我第二次来巴拿马是 1999 年，参加过运河主权交接的仪式，很奇怪，当我们来到管理局大楼 前时，看到星条旗已经降下了，据说是应美国政府要求提前一天降下 的，以避免在众人面前降旗的尴尬场面出现……那时以为是在目睹一 个历史性的时刻，现在想想，这些事情是多么的微不足道。 ” “目标距琴三公里！ ” “是啊，微不足道。 ”汪淼附和道。他根本没有听清斯坦顿在说什 么，世界的其余部分对他来说已经不存在，他的全部注意力都集中到还 没有在视野中出现的“审判日”号上。这时，早晨从太平洋东海岸升起 的太阳正向太平洋西海岸落下，运河中金光粼粼，更近的下方，死亡之 琴静静地立着，两根钢柱黑乎乎的，反射不出一点儿阳光，看上去比流 过它们中间的运河更古老。 “目标距琴两公里！ ” 斯坦顿似乎没有听到步话机中的声音， 仍在滔滔不绝地说着： “自 从得知外星人的舰队正在向地球飞来后，我就得了失忆症。很奇怪，过 中国科幻基石丛书 258 去的事都记不清了，我指的是自己经历过的那些战争，都记不清了，像 刚才所说的，那些战争都那么微不足道。知道这件事以后，每个人在精 神上都将成为新人，世界也将成为新的世界。我一直在想，假设在两千 年前或更早的时间，人们知道有一支外星入侵舰队将在几千年后到达， 那现在的人类文明是什么样子？教授，你能设想一下吗？ ” “哦，不能……”汪淼心不在焉地敷衍着。 “目标距琴一点五公里！ ” “教授， 我想您将成为新世纪的盖拉德 ① ， 我们期待着您的 ‘巴拿马 运河’建成。不是吗？太空电梯其实就是一条运河，像巴拿马运河连接 了两个大洋一样，太空电梯将地球和太空连接起来……” 汪淼现在知道，上校唠叨着这些无意义的废话，其实是想帮他度过 这一艰难时刻。他很感激，但这作用不大。 “目标距琴一公里！ ” “审判日”号出现了，在从侧面山脊上照过来的落日光芒中，它是 河面一片金波上的一个黑色剪影。这艘六万吨级的巨轮比汪淼想象的 要大得多，它出现时，仿佛西边又突现了一座山峰，虽然汪淼知道运河 可以通过七万吨级的船舶，但目睹这样的巨轮在如此窄小的河道中行 驶，确实有一种奇怪的感觉。与它的巨大相比，下面的河流似乎已不存 在，它像一座在陆地上移动的大山。适应了朝阳的光芒后，汪淼看到 “审判日”号的船体是黑色的，上层建筑是雪白的，那面巨型天线不见 了。巨轮发动机的轰鸣声已经可以听到，还有一阵轰轰的水声，那是它 浑圆的船首推起的浪排冲击运河两岸发出的。 随着“审判日”号与死亡之琴距离的缩短，汪淼的心跳骤然加速， 呼吸也急促起来，他有一种立刻逃离的冲动，但一阵虚弱使他已无法控 制自己的身体。他的心中突然涌起了一阵对史强的憎恨，这个王八蛋怎 么会想出这样的主意？ ！正像那位联合国女官员所说，他是个魔鬼！但 ①设计建设巴拿马运河的工程师，盖拉德水道就是以他的名字命名。 地球往事 三体 259 这种感觉转瞬即逝，他想到如果现在大史在身边，那自己的情况会好得 多。斯坦顿上校曾申请大史同来，但常伟思没批准，那边现在更需要他。 汪淼感觉到上校拍了拍他的手。 “教授，一切都会过去的。 ” “审判日”号正在过去，它在通过死亡之琴。当它的舰首接触两根 钢柱之间似乎空无一物的平面时，汪淼头皮一紧，但什么都没有发生， 巨轮庞大的船体从两根钢柱间徐徐驶过。当船体通过一半时，汪淼甚至 怀疑钢柱间的纳米丝是不是真的就不存在。但一个小小的迹象否定了 他的怀疑，他注意到船体上层建筑最高处的一根细长的天线从下部折 断了，天线滚落下来。 很快，纳米丝存在的第二个迹象出现了，而这险些让汪淼彻底崩 溃。“审判日”号宽阔的甲板上很空荡，只是后甲板上有一个人在用水龙 头冲洗缆桩，汪淼从高处看得很清楚，当船的这一部分从钢柱间移过的 瞬间，那人的身体突然僵硬了，水龙头从他手里滑落；与此同时，连接 龙头的胶皮水带也在不远处断成两截，水从那里白花花地喷了出来，那 人直直地站了几秒钟就倒下了，他的身体在接触甲板的同时分成两截。 那人的上半部分还在血泊中爬行，但只能用两只半条的手臂爬，因为他 的手臂也被切断了一半。 船尾通过了两根钢柱后， “审判日”号仍在以不变的速度向前行 驶，一时看不出更多的异样。但汪淼听到发动机的声音发生了怪异的扭 曲，接着被一阵杂乱的巨响所代替，那声音听起来像一台大马达的转子 中被扔进去一个扳手，不，是很多个扳手他知道，这是发动机的转 动部分被切割后发出的。在一声刺耳的破裂声后， “审判日”号的船尾 一侧出现了一个破洞，这洞是被一个巨大的金属构件撞出的。那个飞出 的构件旋即落入水中，激起了高高的水柱，在它一闪而过之际，汪淼看 出那是船上发动机的一段曲轴。 一股浓烟从破洞中涌出，在右岸直线航行了一段的“审判日”号就 拖着这道烟尾开始转向，很快越过河面，撞到左岸上。汪淼看到，冲上岸 中国科幻基石丛书 260 坡的巨大船首在急剧变形的同时，将土坡像水那样冲开，激起汹涌的土 浪。与此同时， “审判日”号开始散成四十多片薄片，每一片的厚度是半 米，从这个距离看去是一片片薄板，上部的薄片前冲速度最快，与下面 的逐级错开来，这艘巨轮像一叠被向前推开的扑克牌，这四十多个巨大 的薄片滑动时相互磨擦，发出一阵尖利的怪音，像无数只巨指在划玻 璃。在这令人无法忍受的声音消失后， “审判日”号已经化做一堆岸上 的薄片，越靠上前冲得越远，像从一个绊倒的服务生手中向前倾倒的一 摞盘子。那些薄片看上去像布片般柔软，很快变形，形成了一堆复杂的 形状，让人无法想象它曾是一艘巨轮。 大批士兵开始从山坡上冲向河岸，汪淼很惊奇附近究竟在什么时 候什么地方隐蔽了这么多人。直升机群轰鸣着沿运河飞来，越过覆盖着 一层色彩斑斓的油膜的河面，悬停在“审判日”号的残骸上空，抛撒大 量的白色灭火剂和泡沫，很快控制了残骸中正在蔓延的火势，另外三架 直升机迅速用缆索向残骸放下搜索人员。 斯坦顿上校已经离开了，汪淼拿起了他放在草帽上的望远镜，克服 着双手的颤抖观察被“飞刃”切割成四十多片的“审判日”号。这时，它 有一大半已被灭火粉剂和泡沫所覆盖，但仍有一部分暴露着。汪淼看到 了切割面，像镜面般光滑，毫不走形地映着天空火红的朝霞。他还看到 了镜面上一块深红色的圆斑，不知是不是血。 三天以后。 审问者：你了解三体文明吗？ 叶文洁：不了解，我们得到的信息很有限，事实上，三体文明真实和 详细的面貌，除了伊文斯等截留三体信息的降临派核心人员，谁都不清 楚。 审问者：那你为什么对其抱有那样的期望，认为它们能够改造和完 善人类社会呢？ 叶文洁：如果他们能够跨越星际来到我们的世界，说明他们的科学 地球往事 三体 261 已经发展到相当的高度，一个科学如此昌明的社会，必然拥有更高的文 明和道德水准。 审问者：你认为这个结论，本身科学吗？ 叶文洁：…… 审问者：让我冒昧推测一下：你的父亲深受你祖父科学救国思想的 影响，而你又深受父亲的影响。 叶文洁（不为人察觉地叹息一声） ：我不知道。 审问者：现在告诉你，我们已经得到了被降临派截留的全部三体信 息。 叶文洁：哦……伊文斯怎么样了？ 审问者：在对“审判日”号采取行动的过程中，他死了。 （伊文斯被“飞刃”切割成三段。当时他身处“审判日”号的指挥 中心，他最上面的那部分向前爬行了一米多，死的时候双眼盯着爬向的 那个方向，正是在那个方向的一台电脑中，找到了被截留的三体信 息。） 叶文洁：信息很多吗？ 审问者：很多，约 28G。 叶文洁：这不可能，星际间超远程通讯的效率很低，怎么可能传送 这么大的信息量？ ！ 审问者：开始时我们也这样想，但事情远远超过了所有人的想象， 即使是最大胆、最离奇的想象。这样吧，请你阅读这些信息的一部分，你 将看到自己美好幻想中的三体文明是什么样子。,"3 1 O p e r a t i o n G u z h e n g “Don’ t worry ,” Shi Qiang said to W ang, as he sat down next to him at the meeting table. “I’m not radio active anymore. The last couple of days they’ve washed me inside and outside like a flour sack. They didn’ t originally think you needed to a ttend this meeting, but I insisted. Heh. I bet the two of us are going to be important this time.” As Da Shi spoke, he picked a cigar butt out of the ashtray , lit it, and took a long drag. He nodded, and, in a slow , relaxed manner , blew the smoke into the faces of the attendees s itting on the other side of the ta ble. One of the p eople sitting opposite him was the original owner of the cig ar , Colonel Stanton of the U.S. Marine Corps. He gave Da Shi a contemptuous look. Many m ore fore ign military of ficers were at this meeting than the last. They were all i n uniform. For the first time in human history , the armed forces of the world’ s nations faced the same enemy . General Chang said, “Comrades , everyone at this meeting now has the same basic understanding of the situation. Or , as Da Shi here would put it, we h ave information parity . The war between alien invaders an d humanity has begun. Our descendants won ’ t face the T risolarans for anoth er four and a half centuries. For now , our opponents are still human. Y et, in essence, these tra itors to the human race can also be seen as enemies f rom outside human civilization. W e have never faced an enemy like this. The next war objective is very clear: W e must capture the intercepted T risolaranmessages stored on Judgment Day . These messages may have great significance for our survival. “W e haven’ t yet done anything to draw the suspicion of Judgment Day . The ship still sails the Atlantic freely . It has already submitted plans to the Panama Canal Authority to pass through the canal in four days. This is a great op portunity for us. As the situation develops, such an opportunity may never ar ise again. Right now , a ll the Battle Command Centers around the globe are drafting up operation plans, and Central will select one within ten hours and begin implementation . The purpose of this meeting is to discuss possible plans of operation, a nd then report one to three of our best suggestions to Central. T ime is of the essence, and we must work ef ficiently . “Note th at any plan must guarantee one thing: the secure capture of the T risolaran messages. Judgment Day was rebuilt from an old tanke r , and both the superstructure and the interior have been extensively renovated with co mplex structures to contain many new rooms and p assageways. Supposedly even the crew relies on a map when entering unfamiliar areas. W e, of course, know even less about the ship’ s layout. Right now , we cannot e ven be certain of the loc ation of the computing center o n Judgment Day , and we don’ t know whether the intercepted T risolaran messages are stored in servers located in the computing center , or how many copies they have. Th e only way to achieve our objective is to completely capture and control Judgment Day . “The mo st dif ficult part is preve nting the enemy from erasing T risolaran data dur ing our attack. Destroyi ng the data would be very easy . The enemy would not use conventional methods to erase the data during an attack, because it’ s easy to recover the data using known technology . But if they just emp tied a cartridge clip at the server hard drive or other storage media, it would all be over , and doing so would take no more than ten seconds. So we must disable all enemies near the storage equipment within ten seconds of th eir detecting an attack. Since we don’ t know the exact loc ation of the data storage or the number of copies, we must eliminate all enemies on Judgment Day with in a very brief period of tim e, before the tar get has been alerted. At the same time, we can’ t heavily damage the facilities within, especially computer equipment. Thus, this is a very dif ficult task. Some think it’ s impossible.”A Japanese Self-Defense Forces of ficer said, “W e believe that the only chance f or succe ss is to rely on spies on Judgment Day . If they ’re fami liar with wh ere the T risolaran inform ation is stored, they can contro l the area or move the storage equipment elsewhere right before our operation.” Someone asked, “Reconnaissance and monitoring of Judgment Day have always been the responsib ility of NA T O military intelligence and the CIA. Do we have such spies?” “No,” the NA T O liaison said. “Then w e have nothing more to discuss except bullshit,” said Da Shi. He was met with annoyed looks. Colonel Stanton said, “Since th e objective is eliminating all p ersonnel within a n enclosed structure without harming other equipment within, our first thought was to use a ball lightning weapon.” Ding Y i shook his head. “The existence of this kind of weapon is now public knowled ge. W e don’ t know if the ship has been equipped with magnetic walls to shield against ball lightning. Even if it hasn’ t, a ball lightning weapon can indeed kill all personnel within the ship, but it cannot do so simultane ously . Also, after the ball lightning enters the ship, it may hover in the air for some time before releasing its ener gy . Thi s wait time can last from a d ozen seconds to a minute or longer . They will have enough time to realize they’ve been attacked and destroy the data.” Colonel Stanton asked, “What about a neutron bomb?” “Colonel, you should know that ’ s not going to work.” The speaker was a Russia n of ficer . “The radiation from a neutron bomb cann ot kill right away . After a n eutron bomb attack, the amount of time left to the enemy would be more than enough for them to have a meeting just like this one.” “Another thought was to use nerve gas,” a NA T O of ficer said. “But releasing it and having it spread throughout the ship would take time, so it still doesn’ t achieve General Chang’ s requirements.” “Then t he only choices left are concussion bombs and in frasonic waves,” Colone l Stanton said. O thers waited for him to finish his thought, but he said nothing more. Da S hi s aid, “I use concussion bombs in police work, but they ’re toys. They’re indeed capable of stunning people inside a building into unconsciousness, but they’re only good for a room or two. Do y ou have any concussion bombs big enough to stun a whole oil tanker full of people?”Stanton shook his head. “No. Even if we did, such a lar ge explosive device would certainly damage equipment inside the ship.” “So what about infrasonic weapons?” someone asked. “They’re still experimental and cannot be used in live combat. Also, the ship is very lar ge. At the power level available to current e xperimental prototypes, the most that a full assault on Judgment Day could do is to make the people inside feel dizzy and nauseous.” “Ha!” D a Shi extinguished the cigar butt, now as tiny as a peanut. “I told you all we have left to discuss is bullshit. W e’ve been at it for a while now . Le t’ s reme mber what the general said: ‘T ime is of the es sence!’” He gave a sly grin to the transla tor , a female first lieutenant w ho looked unhappy with his language. “No t easy to translate, eh, comrade? Just get the approximate meaning across.” But Stan ton seemed to understand what he was saying. He pointed at Shi Qiang with a fresh cigar th at he had just taken out. “Who does this policeman think he is, that he can talk to us this way?” “Who do you think you are?” Da Shi asked. “Colonel Stanton is an expert in special ops,” a NA T O of ficer said. “He has been a part of every major military operation since the V ietnam W ar .” “Then let me tell you who I am. More than thirty years ago, my reconnaissance squad managed to sneak dozens of kilometers behind V ietnamese line s and capture a hydroelectric station under heavy guard. W e prevented the V ietnamese plan to demolish the dam with explosives, which would have flooded the attack route for our army . That’ s w ho I am. I defeated an enemy who once defeated you .” “That’ s enough! ” General Chang slammed the table. “Don’ t b ring up irrelevant matters. If you have a plan, say what it is.” “I d on’ t think we need to waste time on this policeman,” Colonel Stanton said contemptuously , as he lit his cigar . W ithout waiting for a translation, Da Shi jumped up. “‘ Pao-Li-Si ’I heard that word twice. What? Y ou look down on the police? If you’re talking about dropping some bo mbs and turning that ship into smithereens, yeah, you military are the experts. But if you’re talking about retrieving something out of it without da mage, I don’ t care how many stars are on your sho ulder , you aren’ t even a s good as a thief. For this kind of thing, youhave to think outside the box. O UT . OF . THE. BOX! Y ou will never be as good at it as criminals, masters of out-of-the-box thinking. “Y ou kn ow how good they are ? I once handled a robbery where the criminals manag ed to steal one car out of a moving train. They reconnected the cars before a nd after the one they were interested in so that the train got all the way to its destination without anyone noticing. The only tools they used were a len gth of wire cabl e and a few steel hooks. Those are the real special ops experts. And someone like me, a criminal cop who has been playing cat and mouse with them for more than a decade, has received the best education and training from them.” “T ell us your plan, then,” General Chang said. “Otherwise, shut up!” “There a re so many important p eople here that I didn’ t think it was my place to speak. And I was afraid that you, General, would say I was being rude again.” “Y ou’re already the definition of rudeness. Enough! T ell me what your out-of-the-box plan is.” Da Shi picked up a pen and d rew two parallel curves on the table. “That’ s the canal.” He put the ashtray between the two lines. “This is Judgment Day .” Then he reached across the table and pulled Colonel Stanton’ s just-lit cigar out of his mouth. “I can no longer tolerate this idiot!” the colonel shouted, standing up. “Da Shi, get out of here!” General Chang said. “Give me one minute. I’ll be done soon.” Da Shi extended a hand in front of Colonel Stanton. “What do you want?” the colonel asked, puzzled. “Give me another one.” Stanton hesitated for a second before taking another cigar o ut of a beautiful wooden box and handing it to Da Shi. Da Shi took the smoking end of the first cigar and pressed it against the table so that it stood on the shore of the Panama Canal that he’d drawn on the table. He flattened the end of the other cigar and erected it on the other shore of the canal. “W e set up two pillars on the shores of the canal, and then between them we string many parallel, thin filaments, about half a meter apart. The filaments should be made from the nanomaterial called ‘Flying Blade,’ developed by Professor W ang. A very appropriate name, in this case.”After Shi Qiang finished speaking, he stood and waited a few seconds. Then he raised his hands, said to the stunned crowd, “That’ s it,” turned, and left. The air seemed frozen. Everyon e present stayed still like stone statues. Even the droning from the computers all around them seemed more careful. After a long while, someone timidly broke the silence, “Professor W ang, is ‘Flying Blade’ really in the form of filaments?” W ang nodded. “Given our current molecular construction technique, the only for m we can make is a filament. The thickness is about on e-hundredth the thick ness of human hair .… Of ficer Shi got this informatio n from me before the meeting.” “Do you have enough material?” “How wide is the canal? And how tall is the ship?” “The narrowest point of the canal is one hundred fifty meters wide. Judgment Day is thirty-one meters tall, with a draft of eight meters or so.” W ang stared at the cigars on the table and did some mental calculations. “I think I should have enough.” Another long silence. Everyo ne was trying to recover from their astonishment. “What if the equipment storing T risolaran data, such as hard drives and optical disks, is also sliced?” “That doesn’ t seem likely .” “Even if they were sliced,” a computer expert said, “it’ s not a b ig deal. The filaments are extremely sharp, and the cut surfaces wou ld be very smooth. Given that premise, w hether it’ s hard drives, optical disks, or integrated circuit storage, we could recover the vast majority of the data.” “Anyone got a better idea?” C hang looked around the table. No one spoke. “All right. Then let’ s focus on this and work out the details.” Colonel Stanton , who had been silent the whole time, stood up. “I will go and ask Of ficer Shi to come back.” General Chang indicated that he should remain seated. Then he called out, “Da Shi!” Da Shi returned , grinning at ev eryone. He picked up the cigar s on the table. T he one that had been l it he put into his mouth, and t he other he stuf fed into his pocket.Someone asked, “When Judgment Day p asses, can those two pillars bear the force ap plied against the Flying Blade filaments? Mayb e the pillars would be sliced apart first.” W ang said, “That’ s easy to solve. W e have some small amo unts of Flying Blade material that are f lat sheets. W e can use them to protect the parts of the column where the filaments are attached.” The discussion after that was mainly between the naval of ficers and navigation experts. “ Judgment Day is at the upper limit in terms of tonnage that can pass through the Panama Canal. It has a deep draft, so we have to consider installing filaments below the waterline.” “That w ill be very dif ficult. If there’ s not enough time, I don’ t t hink we should w orry ab out it. The parts of the ship below the waterline are used for engines, fuel, and ballast, causing a lot of noise, vibration, and i nterference. The con ditions are too poor for computing centers and other similar facilities to be located there. But for the parts above water , a tighter nanofilament net will give better results.” “Then it’ s best to set the trap at one of the locks along the canal. Judgment Day is built to Panamax specifications, just enough to fill the thirty-two-meter locks. Then we would only need to make the F lying Blade filaments thirty- two meters long. This will also make it easier to erect the pillars a nd string the filaments b etween them, especially for the underwater parts.” “No. The situation around the l ocks is too unpredictable. Also, a ship inside th e lock must be pulled forward by four ‘mules,’ electric l ocomotives on rails. They move slowly , and the time inside the locks will a lso be when the crew is most alert. An attem pt to slice through the ship during that time would most likely be discovered.” “What about the Bridge of the Americas, right outside the M iraflores Locks? The abutments at the two ends of the bridge can serve as the pillars for stringing the filaments.” “No. The distance between the abutments is too great. W e don’ t have enough Flying Blade material.” “Then it’ s decided: The site of operation should be the narrowe st point of the Gaillard Cut, a hundred and fifty meters across. Add in some slack for the pillars … let’ s call it a hundred seventy meters.”W ang sa id, “If that’ s the plan, then the smallest distance between the filaments will be fifty centimeters. I don’ t have enough ma terial for a tighter net.” “In other words, we have to make sure the ship crosses during t he day ,” Da Shi said, blowing out another mouthful of smoke. “Why?” “At nigh t the crew will be slee ping, which means they’ll all be lying down. Fifty centimeters between filaments leaves too much of a gap. But during the day , even if they ’re sitting or crouching, the distance is suf ficient.” A fe w s cattered laughs. The attendees, all under heavy stress, felt a bit of release tinged with the smell of blood. “Y ou’re truly a demon,” a female UN of ficial said to Da Shi. “W ill innocent bystanders be hurt?” W ang asked, his voice trembling. A naval of ficer replied, “When the ship goes through the locks, more than a dozen ca ble workers will come onboard, but they’ll all get of f after the ship passes. The Panama C anal pilot will have to accompa ny the ship the entire eighty-two kilometers, so the pilot will have to be sacrificed.” A C IA of ficer said, “And som e of the crew aboard Judgment Day probably don’ t know the real purpose of the ship.” “Professor ,” General Chang said, “do not concern yourself with these thoughts. The information we need to obtain has to do with the very survival of human civilization. Someone else will make the call.” As the meeting ended, Colonel Stanton pushed the beautiful cigar box in front of Shi Qiang. “Captain, the best Havana has to of fer . They’re yours.” Four days later , Gaillard Cut, Panama Canal W ang could not even tell that he was in a foreign country . He k new that to the w est, not too far away , was beautiful Gatun Lake. T o the e ast was the magnificent Bridge of the Americas and Panama City . But he had had no chance to see either of them. T wo day s earlier , he had arrived by direct flight from China to T ocumen International Air port near Panama City and then rode a helicopt er here. The sight be fore him was very com mon: The construction work under way to widen the canal caused the tropi cal forest on both slopes to be quite sparse,revealing lar ge patches of yellow earth. The color felt familiar to W ang. The canal did n’ t seem very special, p robably because it was so narro w here, but a h undred thousand people had dug out this part of the canal in the previous century , one hoe at a time. W ang and Colonel Stanton sa t on lounge chairs under an awning halfway up the slope. Both wo re loose, colorful shirts, with their Panama hats tossed to the side, looking like two tourists. Below , on each shore of the ca nal, a twenty-four -meter steel pillar lay flat against the ground, parallel to the shore. Fifty ultrastrong nanofilaments, e ach 160 meters long, were strung between the pillars. At the end on the eastern shore, every filament was connected to a length of regular s teel wire. This was to give the filaments enough slack so that they could sin k to the bottom of the canal, aided by attached weights. The setup permitted other ships safe passa ge. Luckily , traf fic along the c anal wasn’ t quite as busy as W ang had ima gined. On average, only about forty lar ge ships passed through each day . The operation’ s code name wa s “Guzheng,” based on the si milarity between the structure and the ancient Chinese zither by that name. The slicing net of nanofilaments was thus called the “zither .” An h our earlier , Judgment Day had ent ered the Gaillard Cut from Gatun Lake. Stanton asked W ang whether he had ever been to Panama before. W ang said no. “I came here in 1989,” the colonel said. “Because of that war?” “Y es, that was o ne of those war s that left me with no impression. I only remember being in front of the V atican embassy as ‘Nowhere to Run’ by Martha and the V andellas played for the holed-up Noriega. T hat was my idea, by the way .” In th e ca nal belo w them, a pure white French cruise ship slow ly sailed past. Sev eral passengers in colorful clothing strolled leisurely on the green- carpeted deck. “Second Observ ation Post reporting: There are no more ships in front of the tar get.” Stanton’ s walkie-talkie squawked. Stanton gave the order . “Raise the zither .”Several men wearing hard hats appeared on both shores, looking like maintenance wo rkers. W ang stood up, but the colonel pulled him down. “Professor , don’ t worry . They know what to do.” W ang watched as those on the eastern shore rapidly winched back the steel wires attached to the nanofilaments and secured the tightened nanofilaments to the pillar . Then, slowly , the two p illars were stood upright using their mechanica l hinges. As a disguise, the pillars were decorated with some navigational markings and water depth indicators. The workers proceeded leisurely , as though they were simply carrying out their boring jobs. W ang gazed at the space between the pillars. There seem ed to be nothing there, but the d eadly zither was already in place. “T ar get is four k ilometers from the zither ,” the voice in the walk ie-talkie said. Stanton put the walkie-talkie do wn. He continued the conversation with W ang. “ The sec ond time I came to Panama was in 1999, to attend the ceremony for the handover of the canal to Panama. Oddly , by the time we got to the Auth ority’ s building , the Stars and Stripes were already gone. Supposedly the U.S. government had requested that the flag b e lowered a day early to avoid the embarra ssment of lowering the flag in front of a crowd.… Back then, I thought I was witnessing history . But now that seems so insignificant.” “T ar get is three kilometers from the zither .” “Y es, insignifica nt,” W ang mumbled. He wasn’ t listening to Stanton at all. The rest of the world had ceased to exist for him. All of his attention was focused on the spot where Judgment Day wo uld appear . By now the sun that had risen over the Atlantic was falling toward the Pacific. The canal sp arkled w ith golden light. Close by , the deadly zither stood quietly . The two steel pillars were dark and reflected no sunlight, looking even older than the canal that flowed between them. “T ar get is two kilometers from the zither .” Stanton seemed to not have heard the voice from the walkie-talkie. He continued, “Afte r learning that the alien fleet is coming toward the Earth, I’ve been suf fering from amnesia. It’ s so strange. I can’ t recall many things from the past. I don’ t remember the details of the wars I experienced. Like I just said, those wars all seem so insignificant. After learning this truth, everyone becom es a new person spiritually , and sees the world anew . I’vebeen thinking: Suppose two tho usand years ago, or even earlie r , humanity learned that an a lien invasion fleet would arrive a few thousand years later . What w ould human civilization be like now? Professor , can you imagine it?” “Ah, no…” W ang answered perfunctorily , his mind elsewhere. “T ar get is one point five kilometers from the zither .” “Professor , I think you will be the Gaillard of this new era . W e’re waiting for your new Panama Canal to be built. Indeed, the space elevator is a ca nal. Just as the Panama Canal connected two oceans, the sp ace elevator will connect space with the Earth.” W ang knew that the colonel’ s b abbling was meant to help him through this very dif ficult time. He was grateful, but it wasn’ t working. “T ar get is one kilometer from the zither .” Judgment Day app eared. In th e light from the setting sun coming over the hills to the side, it was a dark silhouette against the golden w aves of the canal. The sixty-thousand-ton ship was much lar ger than W ang had imagined. Its appearance was like another peak abruptly inserted among the hills. Even though W ang k new that the canal was capable of accommodating ships as lar ge as seventy thousand tons, witnessing such a lar ge ship in su ch a narrow w aterway was a strange feeling. Given its immensity , the canal below se emed to no longer exist. The ship was a mountain glidin g across solid earth. After he grew used to the sunlight, W ang sa w that Judgment Day ’ s hull was pitch black, and the superstructure was pain ted pur e white. The gi ant antenna was gone. They he ard the roar from the ship’ s engines, accomp anied by the churning sound of waves that had been generated by the round prow slapping against the shores of the canal. As the distance between Judgment Day and the deadly zither closed, W ang’ s heart began to beat faster , and his breath became short. He had a desire to run aw ay , but he felt so weak that he could no longer control his body . All at once, he was overwhelmed by a deep hatred for Shi Qiang. How co uld the bastar d have c ome up with such an idea? Like that UN official s aid, he is a demon! But the feeling passed. He thought that if Da Shi wer e by his side, he would probably feel better . Colonel Stanton had invited S hi Qiang to come, but General Chang refused to give permissionbecause he said that Da Shi w as needed where he was. W ang felt the colonel’ s hand on his back. “Professor , all this will pass.” Judgment Day was bel ow them now , passing through the deadly zither . When it s prow first contacted the plane between the two steel pillars, the space that seemed empty , W ang ’ s scalp tightened. But nothing happened. The imm ense hull of the ship continued to slowly sail past the two steel pillars. W hen ha lf the ship had passed, W ang began to doubt whether the nanofilaments between the steel pillars really existed. But a small sig n soon negated his doubt. He noticed a thin antenna located at the v ery top of the superstructure breaking at its ba se, and the antenna tumbling down. Soon, there was a second sign indicating the presence of the nanofilaments, a sign that almost made W ang break down. Judgment Day ’ s wide deck was e mpty save for one man standing near the stern h osing down the s hip’ s bollards. From his va ntage point, W ang saw everything clearly . The moment that that section of the ship passed between the pillars, the hose broke into two pieces not too far from the man, and water spilled out. The man’ s body stif fened, and the nozzle tumbled from hi s hand. He remained standi ng for a few seconds, then fell. As his body co ntacted the deck, it came apart in two halves. The top half crawled through the expanding pool of blood, but had to use two arms that were bloody stumps. The hands had been cleanly sliced of f. After the stern o f the ship went between the two pillars, Judgment Day continued to sail forward at the same speed, and everything seemed normal. But then W ang heard the sound of the engine shift into a stra nge whine, before turning into chaotic noise. It sounded like a wrench being thrown into the rotor of a lar ge motor no, many , many wrenches. He knew this was the result o f the rotating p arts of the engine having been cut. After a piercing, tearing sound, a hole a ppeared in the side of the stern of Judgment Day , made by a lar ge metallic piece punching through the hull. A broken component flew out of the hole and fell into the water , caus ing a lar ge column of water to shoot up. As it briefly flew past, W ang recognized it as a section of the engine crankshaft. A thick column of smoke poured out of the hole. Judgment Day , which had bee n sailing along the righ t shore, now began to turn, dragging thissmoky tail. Soon it crossed over the canal and smashed into the left shore. As W ang looked, the giant prow deformed as it collided into the slope, slicing open the hill like water , causing waves of earth to spill in all directions. At the same time, Judgment Day began to separate into more than forty slices, each slice half a meter thick. The slices near the top moved f aster than the slices near the bottom, and the ship spread open like a deck of cards. As the forty-some metal slices moved past each other , the piercing noise was like countless giant fingernails scratching against glass. By the time the intolerable noise ended, Judgment Day was spilled on the shor e like a stack of plates c arried by a stumbling waiter , the plates near the t op having t raveled the farthest. The slices looked as soft as cloth, and rapidly d eformed into complica ted shapes impossible to imagine as having once belonged to a ship. Soldiers rushed toward the shore from the slope. W ang was surprised to find so many men hidden nearby . A fleet of helicopters arrived along the canal with their engines roaring ; crossed the canal surface, which was now covered by an ir idescent oil slick; hovered over the wreckage of Judgment Day ; an d began to drop lar ge quantities of fire suppression fo am and powder . Shortly , the fire in the w reckage was under control, and three other helicopters began to drop searchers into the wreckage with cables. Colonel Stanton had already left. W ang picked up the binoculars he’d left on top of his hat. Overc oming his trembling hands, he observed Judgment Day . By this time, the wreckage was mostly covered by fire- extinguishing fo am and powder , but the edges of some of the slices were left exposed. W ang saw the cut surfaces, smooth as mirrors. They reflected the fiery red light of dusk perfectly . He also saw a deep red spot on the mirror surface. He wasn’ t sure if it was blood. Three days later INTERROGA T OR: Do you understand T risolaran civilization? YE WENJIE: N o. W e receive d only very limi ted information.

中国科幻基石丛书 262 33．监听员 三体信息中没有包含对三体人生物形态的任何描述，人类要在四 百多年以后才能真正看到三体人。在阅读信息时，叶文洁只能把三体人 想象成人类的形象。 1379 号监听站已经存在了上千年，像这样的监听站，在三体世界中 有几千个，它们全神贯注地聆听着宇宙间可能存在的智慧文明的信息。 最初监听站中有上百名监听员，但随着技术的进步，现在只有一个 人值守了。监听员是一个卑微的职业，他们虽然身处恒温且能保证生活 供给的监听室中，在乱纪元不必脱水，但他们的生命也就在这小小的 空间中流逝，能够享受到的恒纪元快乐比其他人要少得多。 1379 号监听员透过小小的窗子看着外面的三体世界，这是乱纪元 的黑夜，巨月还没有升起来，大多数人都处于脱水的冬眠中，甚至植物 也本能地脱水了，成了附着于地表没有生命的一束干纤维。星光下， 大地看上去像一大块冰冷的金属。 这是最孤寂的时刻，在静静的午夜，宇宙向它的聆听者展示着广漠 的荒凉。 1379 号监听员最不愿意看的，就是显示器上缓缓移动的那条 曲线，那是监听系统接收到的宇宙电波的波形，无意义的噪声。他感到 这条无限长的线就是宇宙的抽象，一头连着无限的过去，另一头连着无 限的未来，中间只有无规律无生命的随机起伏，一个个高低错落的波峰 就像一粒粒大小不等的沙子，整条线就像是所有沙粒排成行形成的一 维沙漠，荒凉寂寥，长得令人无法忍受。你可以沿着它向前向后走无限 地球往事 三体 263 远，但永远找不到归宿。 但今天，当监听员扫了一眼波形显示后，发现有些异样。即使是专 业人员，也很难仅凭肉眼看出波形是否携带信息，但监听员对宇宙噪声 的波形太熟悉了，眼前移动的波形，似乎多了某种说不出来的东西，这 条起伏的细线像是有了灵魂。他敢肯定，眼前的电波是被智能调制的！ 他冲到另一台主机终端前，察看计算机对目前接收内容识别度的判别， 发现识别度是红色 10！！在这之前，监听系统接收到的宇宙电波，识别 度从未超过蓝色 2，如果达到红色，波段包含智能信息的可能性就大于 百分之九十，如果是红色 10，就意味着接收到的信息包含着自译解系 统！解译计算机在全功率工作着，它发现了信息中的自译解系统并成功 地利用它，很快显示译解完成。监听员打开结果文件，三体人第一次读 到了来自另一个世界的信息： 向收到该信息的世界致以美好的祝愿。 通过以下信息，你们将对地球文明有了一个基本的了解。人类经过漫 长的劳动和创造，建立了灿烂的文明，涌现了丰富多彩的文化，并初步 了解了自然界和人类社会运行发展的规律，我们珍视这一切。 但我们的世界仍有极大缺陷，存在着仇恨、偏见和战争，由于生产 力和生产关系的矛盾，财富的分布严重不均，相当部分的人类成员生活 在贫困和苦难之中。 人类社会正在努力解决自己面临的各种困难和问题，努力为地球 文明创造一个美好的未来。发送该信息的国家所从事的事业就是这种 努力的一部分。我们致力于建立一个理想的社会，使每个人类成员的劳 动和价值都得到充分的尊重，使所有人的物质和精神需要都得到充分 的满足，使地球文明成为一个更加完美的文明。 我们怀着美好的愿望，期待着与宇宙中其他文明社会建立联系，期 待着与你们一起，在广阔的宇宙中创造更加美好的生活。 在令他头晕目眩的激动中，监听员看着波形显示，信息仍源源不断 中国科幻基石丛书 264 地从太空涌进天线，由于自译解系统的存在，计算机已经可以实现实 时翻译，接收到的信息被立刻显示出来。在以后的两个三体时中，监听 员知道了地球世界的存在，知道了那个只有一个太阳、永远处于恒纪元 中的世界，知道了在永远风调雨顺的天堂中诞生的人类文明。 来自太阳系的信息结束了，译解计算机开始无结果地运行，监听系 统所听到的，又是宇宙荒凉的噪声，但监听员可以确定，刚才的一切不 是梦。他也知道，分布在世界各处的几千个监听站，也都收到了这三体 文明期待了亿万年的信息。二百轮文明爬行在漆黑的隧道中，现在终于 在前方看到了一线光亮。 监听员又一遍阅读来自地球的信息，他的思绪在地球那永不封冻 的蓝色海洋和翠绿的森林田野间飞翔，感受着那和煦的阳光和清凉的 微风的抚摸，那是个多么美丽的世界啊，二百多轮文明幻想中的天堂居 然真的存在！ 激动和兴奋很快冷却下来，剩下的只有失落和凄凉。在过去那漫长 的孤寂时光中，监听员不止一次地问过自己：即使有一天真的收到了外 星文明的信息，与自己又有什么关系呢？那个天堂不属于自己，自己这 孤独而卑微的生活不会因此有丝毫改变。 但我至少可以在梦中拥有它……监听员想着，让自己进入了睡眠。 在严酷的环境中，三体人进化出睡眠的开关功能，可以在几秒钟内使自 己立刻入睡。 但他并没有得到自己想要的梦，蓝色的地球确实在梦中出现了，但 在一支庞大的星际舰队的炮火下，地球美丽的大陆开始燃烧，蔚蓝的海 洋沸腾蒸发…… 监听员从噩梦中醒来，看到刚刚升起的巨月把一束冷光投进小窗。 他看着窗外寒冷的大地，开始回顾自己孤独的一生。现在，他已经活了 六十万个三体时，三体人的寿命一般在七十至八十万个三体时，其实大 部分人早在这之前就失去了工作能力，这时他们就会被强制脱水，脱水 后的干纤维躯体被付之一炬，三体社会是不养闲人的。 地球往事 三体 265 现在，监听员突然又想到了另一种可能：说收到外星信息对自己没 有影响是不确切的，在目标确定后，三体世界必然会裁减一部分监听 站，而自己所在的这种落后的站点肯定是在首批裁减之列，那时他将面 临失业。监听员的技能很单一，只是一些程式化的操作和维护，很难找 到别的工作。如果在五千个三体时之内还找不到工作，他也将面临着强 制脱水后被焚烧掉的命运。 逃脱这种命运的唯一途径是与一名异性组合。这时，构成他们身体 的有机物质将融为一体，其中三分之二的物质将成为生化反应的能源， 使剩下的三分之一细胞完成彻底的更新，生成一个全新的躯体；之后这 个躯体将发生分裂，裂解为三至五个新的幼小生命，这就是他们的孩 子，他们将继承父母的部分记忆，成为他们生命的延续，重新开始新的 人生。但以监听员卑微的社会地位，孤独封闭的工作环境，又到了这个 年纪，能有哪个异性看得上自己呢？ 在老之将至的这几年，监听员千万遍问自己：这就是我的一生吗？ 他又千万次回答：是的，这就是你的一生，这一生所拥有的，只有监听室 这小小空间中无尽的孤独。 他不能失去那个遥远的天堂，即使是在梦中。 监听员知道，在宇宙尺度上，对于来自太空的低频电波，因为没有 足够长的测量范围，只能确定发射源的方向，却无法知道其距离；在那 个方向上，可能是远距离的高功率发射源，也可能是近距离的低功率发 射源；那个方向有亿万颗恒星，每一颗都以远近不同的星星汇成的星海 为背景，不知道发射源的距离，根本不可能确定位置坐标。 距离，关键是距离！ 其实，确定发射源距离的方法十分简单：给对方回复一个信息，如 果对方在收到这个回信后短时间内回答，由间隔时间和光速就可以得 知距离。问题是：对方会回答吗？或者在延迟很长时间以后回答，使三体 人无法确定电波信号在路上消耗的时间有多少。但既然这个发射源主 动向宇宙中发出呼唤，那他们接到三体世界的信息后有很大可能会回 中国科幻基石丛书 266 答的。监听员可以肯定，现在三体政府已经发出了指令，向那个遥远的 世界发出信息，引诱他们回答。信息也许已经发出，也许还没有。如果是 后者，那么他就有了使自己这卑微的生命燃烧一次的机会。 同地球的红岸基地一样，三体世界的大部分监听站也在同时向太 空中发射信息，呼唤可能存在的外星文明。三体科学家也早就发现了恒 星对于电波的放大功能，遗憾的是半人马区的三颗太阳在结构上与人 类的太阳有很大差异，存在着很大的外围等离子气层（正是这个气层 使三体世界的太阳在一定的距离上突然变成飞星或由飞星显形） ，这 种气层对电磁波有很强的屏蔽作用，使得到达太阳能量镜面的电波功 率有一个极大的阙值，因而不可能把太阳作为天线发射信息，只能用地 面天线直接向目标发射。否则，人类早已得知三体文明的存在了。 监听员扑到操作屏前，在计算机上编辑了一条简短的信息，并指令 计算机译成与收到的地球信息相同的语言。然后，他将监听站的发射天 线指向地球信息来源的方向，发射按钮呈红色的长方形，这时，监听员 的手指悬在它上面。 三体文明的命运，就系于这纤细的两指之上。 毫不犹豫地，监听员按下了发射键，高功率电波带着那条简短但可 能拯救另一个文明的信息飞向黑暗的太空： 这个世界收到了你们的信息。 我是这个世界的一个和平主义者，我首先收到信息是你们文明的 幸运，警告你们：不要回答！不要回答！不要回答！ ！ ！ 你们的方向上有千万颗恒星，只要不回答，这个世界就无法定位发 射源。 如果回答，发射器将被定位，你们的文明将遭到入侵，你们的世界 将被占领！ 不要回答！不要回答！ ！不要回答！ ！ ！ 我们不清楚三体世界元首的官邸是什么样子，但可以肯定他与外 地球往事 三体 267 界之间有厚厚的隔墙，以便适应这个世界的严酷气候。 《三体》游戏中 的金字塔就是一种猜测，另一种可能是它建在地下。 元首在五个三体时前就得到了收到外星文明信息的报告。两个三 体时前，他又得到报告： 1379 号监听站向信息来源方向发出了警告信 息。 前者没有使他狂喜，后者也没有令他沮丧，对那名发出警告信息的 监听员，他也没有什么愤恨。以上这些情绪，还有其他的所有情绪，像恐 惧、悲伤、幸福、美感等等，都是三体文明所极力避免和消除的，因为它 们会导致个体和社会在精神上的脆弱，不利于在这个世界恶劣的环境 中生存。三体世界所需要的精神，就是冷静和麻木，从过去二百余轮文 明的历史中可以证明，那些以这两种精神为主体的文明是生存能力最 强的。 “你为什么这么做？”元首问站在他面前的 1379 号监听员。 “为了不虚度一生。 ”监听员冷静地回答。 “你发出的警告信息，很可能使三体文明失去一次生存的机会。 ” “但给了地球文明这样的机会。元首，请允许我讲这么一件事：大 约在一万个三体时前的乱纪元中，监听站的巡回供给车把我所在的 1379 号站漏掉了，这就意味着我在之后的一百个三体时中断粮了。我 吃掉了站中所有可以吃的东西，甚至自己的衣服，即使这样，在供给车 再度到来时，我还是快要饿死了。上级因此给了我一生中最长的一次休 假，在我随着供给车回城市的途中，我一直被一个强烈的欲望控制着， 那就是占有车上所有的食物。每看到车上的其他人吃东西，我的心中就 充满了憎恨，真想杀掉那人！我不停地偷车上的食品，把它们藏在衣服 里和座位下，车上的工作人员觉得我这样很有意思，就把食品当礼物送 给我。当我到城市下车时，背着远远超过我自身体重的食物…… “当然，后来我从这种精神变态中恢复了，但那种强烈的占有欲望 给我留下极深的印象。三体文明也是一个处于生存危机中的群体，它对 生存空间的占有欲与我当时对食物的欲望一样强烈而无止境，它根本 中国科幻基石丛书 268 不可能与地球人一起分享那个世界，只能毫不犹豫地毁灭地球文明，完 全占有那个行星系的生存空间……我想得对吗？ ” “对，消灭地球文明还有另外一个理由：他们也是好战的种族，很 危险。当我们与其共存于一个世界时，他们在技术上将学得很快，这样 下去，两个文明都过不好。我们已经确定的政策是：三体舰队占领太阳 系和地球后，不会对地球文明进行太多干涉，地球人完全可以像以前那 样生活，就像三体占领者不存在一样，只有一件事是被永远禁止的：生 育。现在我要问：你想当地球的救世主，对自己的文明却没有一点责任 感？ ” “三体世界已经让我厌倦了。我们的生活和精神中除了为生存而 战就没有其他东西了。 ” “这有什么错吗？ ” “当然没有错，生存是其他一切的前提，但，元首，请看看我们的生 活：一切都是为了文明的生存。为了整个文明的生存，对个体的尊重几 乎不存在，个人不能工作就得死；三体社会处于极端的专制之中，法律 只有两档：有罪和无罪，有罪处死，无罪释放。我最无法忍受的是精神生 活的单一和枯竭，一切可能导致脆弱的精神都是邪恶的。我们没有文学 没有艺术，没有对美的追求和享受，甚至连爱情也不能倾诉……元首， 这样的生活有意义吗？ ” “你向往的那种文明在三体世界也存在过，它们有过民主自由的 社会，也留下了丰富的文化遗产，你能看到的只是极小一部分，大部分 都被封存禁阅了。但在所有三体文明的轮回中，这类文明是最脆弱最短 命的，一次不大的乱纪元灾难就足以使其灭绝。再看你想拯救的地球文 明，那个在永远如春的美丽温室中娇生惯养的社会，如果放到三体世 界，绝对生存不了一百万个三体时。 ” “那花朵虽然娇弱但是绚丽无比，她在天堂闲适中感受着自由和 美。 ” “如果三体文明最后占有那个世界，我们也可以创造那样的生 地球往事 三体 269 活。” “元首，我怀疑。金属般的三体精神已经凝固到我们的每一个细胞 中，您真的认为它还能融化吗？我是个小人物，生活在社会的最底层，没 有人会注意到我，孤独一生，没有财富没有地位没有爱情，也没有希望。 如果我能够拯救一个自己爱上的遥远的美丽世界，那这一辈子至少没 有白活。当然，元首，这也让我有缘见到了您，如果不是这个举动，我这 样的小人物也只能在电视上景仰您，所以请允许我在此表达自己的荣 幸。 ” “毫无疑问你是有罪的，你是三体世界所有轮回的文明中最大的 罪犯，但三体法律现在出现一个例外你自由了。 ” “元首，这怎么行？ ” “对你来说，脱水烧掉真是一种微不足道的惩罚。你老了，也不可 能看到地球文明的最后毁灭，但我至少要让你知道你根本拯救不了她， 我要让你活到她失去一切希望的那一天。好了，走吧。 ” 1379 号监听员走后，元首唤入了负责监听系统的执政官。对他，元 首也避免了恼怒，只是例行公事而已。 “你怎么能让这样的脆弱邪恶分子进入监听系统呢？ ” “元首，监听系统有几十万名工作人员，严格甄别是很难的， 1379 号毕竟在那个监听站工作了大半生都没出错。当然，这个最严重的失误 责任在我。 ” “在三体世界的太空监听系统中，与此相关的责任人还有多少？ ” “我初步查了一下，由上至下各个层次，大约六千人吧。 ” “他们都有罪。 ” “是。 ” “六千人都脱水，在首都中心广场烧掉你，就当引火物吧。 ” “谢谢元首，这让我们的良心多少安定了一些。 ” “这之前，我再问你：那条警告信息能传多远？ ” 中国科幻基石丛书 270 “1379 号是一个小型监听站，发射功率不大，大约能传一千二百万 光时（约一千二百光年）吧。 ” “够远了。你对三体文明下一步的行动，有什么建议吗？ ” “是否向那个外星世界发送经过仔细编制的信息，设法引诱他们 回答？ ” “不，这更有可能弄巧成拙。好在那条警告信息很短，我们只能希 望他们能忽略或误解它的内容……好了，你去吧。 ” 监听执政官走后，元首召见了三体舰队统帅。 “首批舰队最后完成启航准备，还需要多长时间？ ” “元首，舰队的建设还处在最后阶段，具备航行能力至少还需要六 万时。 ” “我将请执政官联席会议审议我的计划：舰队建成后立即启航，就 向着那个方向。 ” “元首，在那样的接收频率上，即使方向的定位也不是太准确。要 知道，舰队只能以百分之一光速航行，而且其动力储备只够进行一次减 速，也不可能沿那个方向进行大范围搜索，如果目标距离不明，整个舰 队最终的结局就是坠入宇宙深渊。 ” “但看看我们星系的三颗太阳吧，其中任何一颗的气层随时都可 能膨胀，吞没我们这最后一颗行星。所以，没有别的选择，这个险必须 冒。 ”,"3 2 T r i s o l a r i s : T h e L i s t e n e r The T risolaran data contained no descriptions of the biological appearance of T risolarans. Since humans wo uld not lay eyes on actual T risolarans until more than four hundred years la ter , Y e could only envision the T risolarans as huma noid as she read the me ssages. She filled in the blanks between the lines with her imagination. * * * Listening Post 1379 had already been in existence for more than a thousand years. T here we re several thousand posts like it on T risolaris, all of them dedicating their ef forts to detecting possible signs of intelligent life in the universe. Initially , each listening post h ad several hundred listeners, but as technology advanced, there was only one person on duty . Being a listener was a humble career . Though they lived in listening posts that were kept at a c onstant temperature, with sup port systems that guaranteed their survival without requirin g them to dehydrate during Chaotic Eras, they also had to live their lives within the narrow confines of these tiny spaces. The amount of joy they got from Stable Eras was far less than others got. The liste ner at Post 1379 looked through the tiny window at th e world of T risolaris outside. This was a Chaotic Era night. The giant moon had not yet risen , and most people rema ined in dehydrated hibernation. Even plants had inst inctively dehydrated an d turned into lifeless bundles of dry fiberlying ag ainst the ground. Under the starlight, the ground looked like a giant sheet of cold metal. This was the loneliest time. In th e deep silence of midnight, the universe revealed itself to its listeners as a vast desolation. What the listener of Post 1379 disliked the most was seeing the waves that slowly crawled across the display , a visual record of the m eaningless noise the listening post picked up from space. He felt this inte rminable wave was an abstract view of the universe: one end connected to the endless past, the other to the endless future, and in the middle only the ups and downs of random chance without life, without pattern, the peaks and valleys at dif ferent heights like uneven grains of sand, the whol e curve like a one-dimensional desert made of all the grains of sand lined up in a row: lonely , desolate, so long that it was into lerable. Y ou could follow it and go forward or backward as long as you liked, but you’d never find the end. On this day , however , the listener saw something odd when he glanced at th e waveform display . Even experts had a hard time telling with the naked eye whether a waveform carried information. But the list ener was so familiar with the noise of the universe that he could tell that th e wave that now mo ved in front of his eyes had something extra. The thin c urve, rising and falling, seemed to possess a soul. He was certain that the radio signal before him had been modulated by intelligence. He rush ed in front of another terminal and checked the com puter ’ s rating of the signal’ s recognizab ility: a Red 10. Before this, no radio signal received by the listening post had ever garnered a recognizability rating above a Blue 2. A Red rating meant the likelihood that the t ransmission contained intelli gent information was greater than 90 percent. A rating of Red 10 meant th e received transmission contained a self-interpreting coding system! The deciphering computer worked at full power . Still cau ght up by the dizzying excitement and confusion, the listener stared at the wa veform display . Information continued to strea m from the universe into the antenna. Because of the self-interpreting code, the computer was able to perform real-time translation, and the message began to show up immediately . The liste ner opened the resulting document, and, for the first time, a T risolaran read a message from another world.W ith the best of intentions, we look forward to establishing contact with other civilized societies in the unive rse. W e look forward to working together with you to build a better life in this vast universe. * * * During t he next two T risolaran hours, the listener learned of the existence of Earth, learned of the world th at had only one sun and remained always in a Stable Era, learned of the human civilization that had been born in a paradise where the climate was eternally mild. The transmission from the solar system ended. The deciphering computer now ran uselessly . The post was once again only hearing the noise of the universe. But the listener was certain that what he had just experienced was not a dream. H e knew as well that the several thousand listening p osts spread across T risolaris had also received this message, which T risolaran civilization had awaited for eons. T wo hundred cycles of civilization had been cra wling t hrough a dark t unnel, and there was finally a glimmer of light before them. The listener read over the message from the Earth again. His thoughts drifted over the blue ocean that never froze and the green forests and fields, enjoying the warm sunlight a nd the caress of a cool breeze. What a beautiful world! The paradise we imagined r eally exists! The thri ll and excitement coole d, and all that remained was a sense of loss and desolat ion. During the long loneliness of the past, the listener had asked hi mself more than once: Even if one day a message fr om an extra- T risolaran civilization wer e to arrive, what would that have to do with me? His own lonely and humble life would not change one iota because of it. But I can at lea st possess it in my dr eam.… And the listener drifted of f to sl eep. In their harsh environment, the T risolarans had evolve d the ability to switch sleep on and of f. A T risolaran could put himself to sleep in seconds. But he did not get the dream that he wanted. The blue Earth did appear in his dream, bu t under the bom bardment of an enormous interstellar fleet, the beautiful continents of Earth were burning, the deep blue oceans were boiling and evaporating.…The listener woke up from his nightmare and saw the giant moon, just risen, ca sting a thin ray of cold light through the small window . He looked at the frozen ground outside the window and reviewed his lonely life. By now , he had lived six hundred thousand T risolaran hours. The life expectancy of T risolarans range d between seven hundred to eight hundred thousand T risolaran hours. Mo st people, of course, would have lost the ability to work productively l ong before then. They would have been forcibly dehydrated, and the resulting dry fibers cast to the flames. T risolaris did not keep the idle around. But now the listener saw another possibility . It was inaccurat e to say that the receipt of the extra-T risolaran message had no influence on his life. After confirmati on, T risolaris would surely reduce the number of listening posts. And posts like this one, be hind the times, would be among the first to be cut. Then he would be un employed. A listener ’ s skills were very specialized, consisting only of some routine operations and maintenance. It would be very dif ficult to find another job. If he couldn’ t find another job within five thousand T risolaran hours, he would be forcibly dehydrated and then burnt. The onl y way to escape this fate was to mate with a member of the opposite sex. When that happened, the or ganic material making up their bodies w ould m eld into one. T w o-thirds of the material would then become fuel to power the biochemical reaction that would completely renew the cells in the remaining one-thir d and create a new body . Then this body would d ivide in to three to five tiny new lives: their children. They would inherit s ome of the memories of their parents, continue their lives, and begin the cycle of life anew . But given the listener ’ s low social position, lonely a nd enclosed workspace , and advanced age, what member of the opposite sex would be interested in him? In th e last few years, the listener had asked himself millions of times: Is this all ther e is t o my life? And millions of times he had answered himself: Y es, this is all ther e is. All that you have in this life is the endless loneliness in the tiny space of this listening post. He couldn’ t lose that paradise, even if it was only in a dream. The listener knew that at the sc ale of the universe, due to the lack of a suf ficiently long measurement b aseline, it was impossible to determine the distance o f a sou rce of low-frequency r adio transmission from space, onlythe direction. The source could be high-powered but far aw ay , or low- powered but close by . In that direction were billions of stars, each shining against a sea of other stars at dif ferent distances. W ithout knowing how far away the source was, it was impossible to ascertain its exact coordinates. Distance, the key was distance. Indeed, there was an easy w ay to ascertain the distance of the transmission sou rce. Just respond to the message, and if the other party replies quickly to the response, t he T risolarans could determine the distance based on the round-trip time an d the speed of light. Or maybe they would take a really long time to reply and cause the T risolarans to b e unable to determine how long the message was en route. But the question was: W ould the other party reply? Since this source had actively sent out a call into the universe, it was very likely that they would reply after getting a response from T risolaris. And the listener was sure that the T risolaran government had already given the order to send a message to that dist ant worl d to lure them to respond. Maybe the message had already been sen t, but maybe not. If the latter was true, then the listener had a singular chance to make his own humble life glow . The liste ner dashed in front of the operations screen and composed a short, s imple message on the computer . He directed the computer to translate the message into the same language as the message received from the Earth. Then, he pointed the listening post’ s antenna in the direction the message from Earth had come from. The T ransmit button was a red rectangle. The listener ’ s fingers hovered above it. The fate of T risolaran civilization was now tied to these slender fingers. W ithout hesitation, the listener pressed the button. A high-powered radio wave carried that short m essage, a message that could s ave another civilization, into the darkness of space. Do not answer! Do not answer!! Do not answer!!! * * * W e don ’ t know what the of ficial residence of the princeps of T risolaris looked like, but we can be sur e that thick walls separated him from theoutside so as to protect him against the extreme weather . The pyramid from the Thr ee Body gam e w as one guess about what it could look like. That they built the residence deep under ground is another . Five T risolaran hours earlier , t he princeps received the report of the extra-T risolaran communication. T wo T risolaran hours earlier , he received another report: Listening Post 1379 had sent out a warning message in the direction of the transmission. The firs t report did not cause hi m to leap up in ecstasy , and the second report did not c ause him to sink into depression. He wasn’ t even angry or resentful. All of these emotionsand other emotions, such as fear , sorrow , happiness, and appreciation of beautywere things that the T risolaran civilization stro ve to avoid a nd eliminate. Such emotions caused the individual and society to be weak spiritually and did not help w ith survival in th e harsh env ironment of this world. The mental states that T risolarans needed w ere calmness and numbness. The history of the past two hundred- some cycles of civilization proved that civilizations that relied o n these two states as their spiritual core were the most capable of survival. “Why did you do this?” the princeps asked the listener from Post 1379. “So that my life isn’ t wasted,” the listener answered calmly . “The wa rning you sent out ma y have cost T risolaran civilization the chance at survival.” “But it gave Earth civilization such a chance. Princeps, T r isolaran civilization’ s desire to possess living space is like the desire of a man who has been starving for a long time for food, and it is similarly boundless. W e cannot s hare the Earth with the people of that world. W e could only destroy Earth civilizatio n and completely take over that solar system.… Am I right?” “Y es. B ut there is another reason for destroying Earth civi lization. They’re also a w arlike race. V ery dangerous. If we try to coexist with them on the same pla net, they will s hortly learn our technology . Continuing in that stat e would allow neither c ivilization to thrive. Let me as k you: Y ou wish to be the savior of the Earth, but do you not feel an y sense of responsibility for your own race?” “I am tired of T risolaris. W e have nothing in our lives and spiri t except the fight for survival.” “What’ s wrong with that?”“There’ s nothin g wrong, of course. Existence is the premise for everything else. But, Princeps, please examine our lives: Everything is devoted to survival. T o permit the survival of the civilization as a whole, there is almost no respect for th e individual. Someone who can no longer work is put to death. T risolaran society exists under a state of extreme authoritarianism. The law has only two outcomes: The guilty are put to death, and the not guilty are released. For me, the most intolerable aspects are the spiritual monotony an d desiccation. Anything that can lead to spiritual weakness is declared evil. W e have no literature, no art, no pursuit of beauty and e njoyment. W e cannot even speak of love.… Princeps, is there meaning to such a life?” “The kind of civ ilization you yearn for once existed on T risola ris, too. They had free, democratic societies, and they left behind rich cultural legacies. Y ou know barely any thing about them. Most details have been sealed away and forbidden from view . But in all the cycles of T risolaran civilization, this type of civilization was the weakest and most short-lived. A m odest Chaotic Era disaster w as enough to extinguish them. Look again at the Earth civilization that yo u wish to save. A society born and bred in the e ternal spring of a beautiful hothouse would not be able to survive even a million T risolaran hours if it were transplanted here.” “That fl ower may be delicate, but it possesses peerless splendor . She enjoys freedom and beauty in the ease of paradise.” “If T risolaran civilization ultim ately possesses that world, we can also create such lives for ourselves.” “Princeps, I’m doubtful. The metallic T risolaran spirit has infiltrated each of our cells and solidified. Y ou really believe it can melt again? I’m an ordinary man living at the bottom of society . No one would pay any attention to me. My life is spent alone, without wealth, wit hout status, without love, and without hope. If I can save a distant, beautiful world that I have fallen in love with, then my life has not been wasted. Of course, Princeps, this also gave me a chance to see you. If I had not done this, a man like me could only ever hope to admire you on TV . So permit me to express myself as honored.” “Y ou’re guilty beyond doubt. Y ou’re the greatest criminal in all the cycles of T risolaran civilization. But now we make an exception in T risolaran law: Y ou’re free to go.”“Why?” “For you, dehydration follow ed by burning is not even remotely adequate as punishment. Y ou’re old, and you will not live to see the final destruction of Earth civilization. But I will at least make sure that you know that you cannot save her . I want to let you live until the day she loses all hope. “All right. Y ou may leave.” * * * After the listener from Post 1379 left, the princeps called in the consul responsible for the monitoring system. The princeps also av oided being angry at him. H e dealt with it as a routine matter . “How could you allow such a weak and evil man into the monitoring system?” “Princeps, the monitoring system employs hundreds of thousands. T o screen them all strictly is very dif ficult. After all, the man managed to perform his duties at Listening P ost 1379 without error for mos t of his life. Of course, this most serious mistake is my responsibility .” “How many others bear some responsibility for this failure in the T risolaran Space Monitoring System?” “My preliminary investigation shows about six thousand, accounting for all levels.” “They’re all guilty .” “Y es.” “Dehydrate all six thousand and burn them together in the square in the middle of the capital. As for you, you can be the kindling.” “Thank you, Princeps. This will at least calm our consciences a little.” “Before carrying out this punish ment, let me ask you: How far can that warning message travel?” “Listening Post 1379 is a small facility without high trans mission power . The maximum range may be twelve million light-hours, about twelve hundred light-years.” “That’ s far enough. Do you ha ve any suggestions for what T risolaran civilization should do next?” “How about transmitting a caref ully composed message to that world to lure them to respond?”“No. That might make matters worse. At least the warning message is very short. W e can only hope that they ignore it, or misunderstand its contents … All right. Y ou may leave.” After the consul left, the princ eps summoned the commande r of the T risolaran Fleet. “How long would it take to complete the preparations for the first wave of the fleet?” “Princeps, the fleet is still in the last phase of construction. At le ast sixty thousand more hours are needed before the ships are spaceworthy .” “I w ill soon pr esent my plan for approval by the Joint Se ssion of Consuls. After construction is complete, the fleet should set sail in that direction at once.” “Princeps, given the frequency of the transmission, even the direction of the sour ce cannot be ascertained with great accuracy . The fleet is only capable of cruising at one-hundredth the speed of light. Also, it only has enough power in reserve to perf orm one deceleration, making it impossible to conduct a wide-area search in that direction. If the distance to the tar get is unclear , the fleet will ultimately fall into the abyss of space.” “But look at the three suns around us. At any moment, the plasm a outer layer of one of them may begin to expand and swallow its last planet, our world. W e have no other choice. W e must make this gamble.”"
地球往事 三体 271 34．智 子 八万五千三体时（约 8.6个地球年）后。 元首下令召开三体世界全体执政官紧急会议，这很不寻常，一定有 什么重大的事件发生。 两万三体时前，三体舰队启航了，它们只知道目标的大致方向，却 不知道它的距离。也许，目标处于千万光时之外，甚至在银河系的另一 端，面对着前方茫茫的星海，这是一次希望渺茫的远征。 执政官会议在巨摆纪念碑下举行。 （汪淼在阅读这一段信息时， 不 由联想到《三体》游戏中的联合国大会，事实上，巨摆纪念碑是游戏中 少数在三体世界中真实存在的事物之一。 ） 元首选定这个会址，令大多数与会者迷惑不解。乱纪元还没有结 束，天边刚刚升起了一轮很小的太阳，随时都可能落下，天气异常寒冷， 以至于与会者不得不穿上全封闭的电热服。巨大的金属摆锤气势磅礴 地摆动着，冲击着寒冷的空气，天边的小太阳把它的影子长长地投射到 大地上，像一个顶天立地的巨人在行走。众目睽睽之下，元首走上巨摆 的基座，扳动了一个红色的开关，转身对执政官们说： “我刚刚关闭了巨摆的动力电源，它将在空气阻力下慢慢地停下 来。 ” “元首，为什么这样？”一位执政官问。 “我们都清楚巨摆的历史涵义，它是用来对上帝进行催眠的。现在 我们知道，上帝醒着对三体文明更有利，它开始保佑我们了。 ” 众人沉默了，思索着元首这话的含义。在巨摆摆动了三次之后，有 中国科幻基石丛书 272 人问： “地球文明回电了？ ” 元首点点头： “是的，半个三体时前我得到的报告，是回答那条警 告信息的。 ” “这么快？ ！现在距警告信息发出仅八万多时，这就是说，这就是说 ……” “这就是说，地球文明距我们仅四万光时。 ” “那不就是距离我们最近的那颗恒星吗？ ！ ” “是的，所以我说：上帝在保佑三体文明。 ” 狂喜在会场上蔓延开来，但又不能充分表露，像被压抑的火山。元 首知道，让这种脆弱的情绪爆发出来是有害的，于是，他立刻对“火山” 泼了盆冷水： “我已经命令三体舰队航向这颗恒星，但事情并不如你们想象的 那样乐观，照目前的情况看，舰队是在航向自己的坟墓。 ” 元首这话使执政官们立刻冷静下来。 “有人明白我的意思吗？”元首问。 “我明白。 ”科学执政官说， “我们都仔细研究过第一批收到的地 球信息，其中最值得注意的是他们的文明史。请看以下事实：人类从狩 猎时代到农业时代，用了十几万地球年时间；从农业时代到工业时代用 了几千地球年；而由工业时代到原子时代，只用了二百地球年；之后，仅 用了几十个地球年，他们就进入了信息时代。这个文明，具有可怕的加 速进化能力！而在三体世界，已经存在过的包括我们在内的二百个文明 中，没有一个经历过这种加速发展，所有的三体文明的科学和技术的进 步都是匀速甚至减速的。我们世界的各个技术时代，都需要基本相同的 漫长的发展时间。 ” 元首接着说： “现实是，在四百五十万时后，当三体舰队到达地球 所在的行星系时，那个文明的技术水平已在加速发展中远超过我们！三 体舰队经过那么漫长的航行，中间还要穿越两条星际尘埃带，很可能只 有一半的飞船到达太阳系，其余的将损失在漫长的航程中。到那时，三 地球往事 三体 273 体舰队在地球文明面前将不堪一击我们不是去远征，是去送死！ ” “如果真是这样，元首，还有更可怕的……”军事执政官说。 “是的，这很容易想到。三体文明的位置已经暴露，为了消除未来 的威胁，地球的星际舰队将反攻我们的星系。很可能，在膨胀的太阳把 这颗行星吞没之前，三体文明已经被地球人消灭了。 ” 光明灿烂的前景突然变得如此黯淡，使会场沉默了好久。 元首说： “我们下一步要做的，就是遏制地球文明的科学发展。早 在收到第一批信息时，我们就开始制定这方面的计划。现在，实现这些 计划出现了一个很有利的条件：我们这次收到的回答信息，是由地球文 明的一个背叛者发出的，那么我们有理由猜测，地球文明的内部存在着 相当多的异己力量，我们要充分利用这种力量。 ” “元首，谈何容易，我们与地球的联系细若游丝，八万多时才能完 成一次应答。 ” “也不尽然，同我们一样，地球世界得知外星文明的存在对整个社 会来说是一个巨大的冲击，将对文明内部产生深远影响。我们有理由预 测，地球文明内部的异己力量将汇集和增长。 ” “那他们能做什么呢？进行破坏吗？ ” “在长达四万时的时间跨度上，任何传统的战争和恐怖活动的战 略意义都不大，都可以得到恢复。在这样长的时间跨度上，要想有效遏 制一个文明的发展，解除其武装，办法只有一个，杀死它们的科学。下 面，请科学执政官简单介绍一下我们已经制定的三个计划。 ” “第一个计划代号‘染色’ 。”科学执政官说， “利用科学和技术产 生的副作用，使公众对科学产生恐惧和厌恶，比如我们世界中技术发展 导致的环境问题，想必在地球上也存在，染色计划将充分利用这些因 素。第二个计划代号‘神迹’ 。即对地球人进行超自然力量的展示，这个 计划力图通过一系列的‘神迹’ ，建造一个科学逻辑无法解释的虚假宇 宙。当这种假象持续一定时间后，将有可能使三体文明在那个世界成为 宗教信徒的崇拜对象，在地球的思想界，非科学的思维方式就会压倒科 中国科幻基石丛书 274 学思维，进而导致整个科学思想体系的崩溃。 ” “如何产生神迹呢？ ” “神迹之所以成为神迹，关键在于它是地球人绝对无法识破的。这 可能需要我们向地球异己力量输入一些高于他们现有水平的技术。 ” “这太冒险了，最后谁会用到这些技术？简直是玩火！ ” “当然，输入什么层次的技术来产生神迹，还有待于我们进一步研 究……” “请科学执政官停一下！ ”军事执政官站起来说， “元首，我想表明 自己的看法：这两个计划对杀死人类的科学，几乎起不到什么作用。 ” “但做总比不做强。 ”科学执政官抢在元首回答前争辩道。 “也仅此而已。 ”军事执政官不屑地说。 “我同意你的看法， ‘染色’和‘神迹’两个计划，只能对地球科学 发展产生一些干扰。 ”元首对军事执政官说，然后转向所有与会者， “我 们需要一个决定性的行动，彻底窒息地球的科学，使其锁死在现有水 平。在这里，我们需要抓住重点：科学技术的全面发展取决于基础科学 的发展，而基础科学的基础又在于对物质深层结构的探索，如果这个领 域没有进展，科学技术整体上就不可能产生重大突破。其实，这并非只 是针对地球文明，也是针对三体文明要征服的所有目标，早在首次收到 外星信息之前，我们就在做着这方面的努力，近期的步伐大大加快了。 各位请看，那是什么？ ” 元首指指天空，执政官们向那个方向抬头仰望，看到太空中的一个 圆环，在阳光中发出金属的光泽。 “那不是用于建造第二支太空舰队的船坞吗？ ” “不是，那是一台正在建造的巨型粒子加速器。建造第二支太空舰 队的计划取消了，其资源全部用于智子工程。 ” “智子工程？ ！ ” “是的，在场的人至少有一半不知道这个计划，我现在请科学执政 官把它介绍给大家。 ” 地球往事 三体 275 “我知道这个计划， 但没想到已经进行到这个程度。 ” 工业执政官 说。 文教执政官： “我也知道，但感觉那像个神话。 ” “智子工程，简而言之就是把一个质子改造成一台超级智能计算 机。 ”科学执政官说。 “作为一个广为流传的科学幻想， 这大家都听说过。 ” 农业执政官 说，“但要成为现实，还是太突然了些。我知道，物理学家们已经能够操 控微观世界十一维结构中的九维，但我们还是无法想象，他们能把一把 小镊子伸进质子，在里面搭建大规模集成电路吗？ ” “当然不行，对微观集成电路的蚀刻，只能在宏观中进行，而且只 能在宏观的二维平面上进行。所以，我们需要将一个质子进行二维展 开。” “把九维结构展开成二维？面积有多大？ ” “很大，您会看到的。 ”科学执政官微笑着说。 时光飞逝，六万个三体时又过去了。在太空中的巨型加速器完全建 成后的两万个三体时，对质子的二维展开将要在三体行星的同步轨道 上进行。 这是一个恒纪元风和日丽的日子，天空十分纯净。同八万个三体时 前舰队启航的时候一样，三体世界的人们都在仰望着太空，看着那巨大 的圆环。元首和全体执政官再次来到了巨摆纪念碑下，巨摆早已静止， 摆锤如一块稳定的磐石凝固在高大的支架间，看上去很难相信它曾经 运动过。 科学执政官发出了二维展开的启动命令。太空中，圆环周围有三个 立方体，那是为加速器提供能量的聚变发电站，现在，它们那形状像长 翅的散热片渐渐发出暗红色的光。科学执政官向元首报告展开正在进 行，人们紧张地仰望着太空中的加速器，什么都没有发生。 十分之一个三体时后，科学执政官捂着耳机听了一会儿，说： “元 中国科幻基石丛书 276 首，很遗憾，展开失败了，多减了一个维度，目标质子被减成一维。 ” “一维？一条线？ ” “是的，一条无限细的线，从理论上计算，它的长度有一点五千光 时。 ” “哼！ ”军事执政官说， “花费了一支太空舰队的资源，就得到这么 个结果？ ” “这是科学实验，总有个调试的过程，这才是第一次展开实验嘛。 ” 人们带着失望散了，但事情并没有完。本来认为被一维展开的质子 将永远运行在行星的同步轨道上，但由于太阳暴产生的阻力使其减 速，一部分一维丝还是落入了大气层。六个三体时后，来到户外的人们 发现周围有奇怪的闪光，那些闪光呈细丝状，转瞬即逝，出没不定。他们 很快从新闻中得知，这是被展开成一维的质子在引力的作用下飘落到 地面上来了。虽然这些一维丝是无限细的，但它的核力场还是能够反射 可见光，还是能够被看到。这是人们第一次看到不是由原子构成的物 质，它们本身只是一个质子的一小部分。 “这些东西真讨厌。 ”元首不断地用手拂脸，此时他正同科学执政 官一起站在政府大厦前宽阔的台阶上， “我总是感到脸上痒。 ” “元首，这只是您的心理作用。所有一维丝的质量之和也就相当于 一个质子，所以它们对宏观世界几乎不产生任何作用，当然也没有任何 害处，就像不存在一样。 ” 但空中落下的一维丝越来越密，在阳光下，地面附近的空间中充满 了细小的闪光，太阳和星辰看上去都围着一圈银色的绒边。外出的人们 身上缠满了一维丝，走动时拖着一片细小闪光。他们回到室内后，一维 丝在灯光下闪亮，只要他们一活动，细丝的反光就在他们周围描绘出被 他们扰动的空气的形状。虽然一维丝只能在光线下看到，不产生任何触 觉，但这也够令人心烦意乱的了。 一维丝的暴雨整整下了二十多个三体时才停止，这并非因为细丝 都落到地面上，它们的质量虽然令人难以想象的微小，但还是有的，所 地球往事 三体 277 以在重力下的加速度与普通物体一样，但一进入大气层，就立刻完全受 气流控制，永远也不会落下。但在一维展开后，质子内部的强互作用力 大大减弱，使得一维丝的强度不大，渐渐断裂成小段，反射的光肉眼看 不见了，人们就感觉它们消失了。一维丝的尘埃在三体世界的空间中是 永远漂浮着的。 五十个三体时后，质子的二维展开第二次进行。这一次，地面上的 人们很快看到了异兆，当聚变发电站的散热片发出红光后，在加速器的 位置上，突然出现了几个巨大的物体，都呈很规则的几何形状，有球体、 四面体、立方体和锥体等，它们的表面色彩很复杂，细看发现原来是根 本没有色彩，几何体的表面都是全反射的镜面，人们看到的只是被映照 的行星表面扭曲的图像。 “这次成功吗？”元首问， “这就是被展开成二 维的质子？ ” 科学执政官回答： “元首，这次仍不成功，我得到加速器控制中心 的报告，这次少减了一个纬度，目标质子被展开成三维。 ” 巨大的镜面几何体以很快的速度继续涌现，形状也更加多样化，有 环状和立体十字形，甚至还出现了一个类似于莫比乌斯带的扭环。所有 几何体从加速器的位置飘移开去。约半个三体时后，这些几何体布满了 大半个天空，像是一个巨人孩子在苍穹中撒了一盒积木。几何体反射的 阳光使地面的亮度增加了一倍，且闪烁不定，巨摆的影子在这投到地面 的天光中时隐时现，左右摇摆。接着，所有的几何体开始变形，渐渐失去 了规则的形状，像受热融化似的。这种变形愈演愈烈，变化的形状越来 越纷乱复杂，现在天空中的东西不再使人联想到积木，更像是一个巨人 被肢解后的肢体和内脏。由于形状的不规则，它们散射到地面上的阳光 均匀柔和了一些，但其本身表面的色彩却更加怪异和变幻莫测。 在布满天空的这些杂乱的三维体中，有一些引起了地面观察者们 的特别注意，首先是因为这些三维体极其相似，再细看时，人们辨认出 了它们所表达的东西，一阵巨大的恐怖感席卷整个三体世界。 中国科幻基石丛书 278 那都是眼睛！ （我们不知道三体人眼睛的形状，但有一点可以肯 定：任何智慧生物对眼睛的图像都是十分敏感的。 ） 元首是少有的真正保持着镇静的人， 他问科学执政官： “一个微观 粒子，内部的结构能复杂到什么程度？ ” “那要看从几维视角来观察了。从一维视角看微观粒子，就是常人 的感觉，一个点而已；从二维和三维的视角看，粒子开始呈现出内部结 构；四维视角的基本粒子已经是一个宏大的世界了。 ” 元首说： “宏大这种词用在质子这样的微观物上，我总觉得不可思 议。 ” 科学执政官没有理会元首，自顾自地说下去： “在更高维度上，粒 子内部的复杂程度和结构数量急剧上升，我在下面的类比不准确，只是 个形象的描述而已：七维视角的基本粒子，其复杂程度可能已经与三维 空间中的三体星系相当；八维视角下，粒子是一个与银河系一样宏大浩 渺的存在；当视角达到九维后，一个基本粒子内部结构的数量和复杂程 度，已经相当于整个宇宙。至于更高的维度，我们的物理学家还无法探 测，其复杂度我还想象不出来。 ” 元首指指太空中那些巨大的眼睛： “眼前的事情是不是表明， 被展 开的质子所包含的微观宇宙中，存在智慧生命？ ” “生命这个定义，用在高维度微观宇宙中怕不合适，更准确些，我 们只能说那个宇宙中存在智能或智慧。这样的可能科学家们早已预测 到了，那样复杂宏大的一个世界，如果没有演化出智慧这样的东西反倒 是不正常了。 ” “它们为什么变化出眼睛来看着我们？”元首仰望天空。那些太空 中的眼睛是很精致的雕塑，栩栩如生，它们都看着下面的行星，目光似 乎很诡异。 “也许只是想显示自己的存在吧。 ” “那些东西都会落到地面上来吗？ ” “不会的，请元首放心。即使落下来，与上次一维展开的细丝一样， 地球往事 三体 279 这些巨大的物体全部质量之和也就相当于一个质子而已，不会对我们 的世界产生任何影响。人们要做的，只是使自己的心理适应这种奇观而 已。 ” 但这次，科学执政官错了。 现在，人们可以觉察到，在布满天空的所有三维体中， “眼睛”们 的移动速度明显地比别的几何体快，而且它们都在向着同一点汇聚。很 快，两个眼睛相遇了，合为一体，合成后的形状仍是眼睛；只是体积增大 了。更多的“眼睛”加入合成体，后者的体积也在迅速增大。最后，所有 的“眼睛”合为一体，这颗“眼睛”是如此巨大，仿佛代表着整个宇宙在 盯着三体世界。它的眸子清澈明亮，中心映着一轮太阳，在广阔的眼睑 上，缤纷的色彩如洪水般滚滚而过。时间不长， “巨眼”表面的细节开始 变淡，渐渐消失了， “巨眼”变成了一只没有眸子的盲眼；然后，它的形 状开始改变，最后完全失去了眼睛的形状，变成一个完美的圆。当这个 巨圆开始缓缓转动时，人们发现它并不是平面，而是一个抛物面，像从 一个巨球上切下的一部分。 军事执政官盯着空中那个缓缓转动的巨物，突然悟出了什么，喊 道： “元首，快，还有其他人，快进地下掩蔽室！ ”他指着上方， “它是 ……” “一面反射镜， ”元首冷静地说， “命令太空防御部队立刻摧毁它， 我们就在这里看，哪儿也不去。 ” 反射镜聚焦的阳光这时已经投射到三体行星上，最初光斑的面积 很大，焦点的热量还不具杀伤力。这个光斑在大陆上移动着，寻找着目 标。反射镜显然发现了首都这个最大的城市，光斑向这里移来，很快将 首都罩在它的范围内。巨摆纪念碑下的人们只看到太空中出现一团巨 大的光亮，这光强得掩去了空中其他的一切。与此同时，人们感到了一 阵酷热袭来。笼罩首都的大光斑在迅速收缩，这是反射镜在进一步聚焦 阳光，太空中的光团亮度持续增强，使人们不能抬头，光斑内的人们则 感到热度在急剧增加。就在酷热已不可忍受之时，光斑的边界扫过了巨 中国科幻基石丛书 280 摆纪念碑，一切都骤然暗了下来。这里的人们花了好一会儿才使眼睛适 应了正常的光亮。他们抬头首先看到的是一根顶天立地的光柱，呈倒锥 形，太空中的反射镜就是光锥的底部，光锥的头部正刺中首都的中心， 使那里的一切都在短时间内变成白炽状态，滚滚的烟柱从那里腾空而 起，被光锥的不均匀热量引发的龙卷风则形成了另外几根接天的尘柱， 围绕着光锥扭动舞蹈着…… 几团耀眼的火球在反射镜的不同部分出现了。它们的颜色与反射 镜发出的光芒不同，是蓝色的，这是三体世界太空防御部队发射的核弹 在目标上爆炸。由于爆炸是在大气层外进行的，听不到声音。当这几团 火球熄灭时，反射镜上出现了几个大洞，然后整个镜面开始撕裂，最后 破裂成十几块。与此同时，死亡光锥消失了，世界重新回到正常的光亮 中，人们一时间觉得一切像月夜般昏暗。那些已失去了智能的碎块继续 变形，很快与太空中其他的几何体混在一起不分彼此了。 “下次展开实验会怎么样？”元首带着嘲讽的神情对科学执政官 说，“会不会把一个质子展开成四维？ ” “元首，即使这样也问题不大，四维展开后的质子体积要小很多， 如果太空防御部队做好准备，对其在三维空间的投影进行攻击，同样可 以摧毁它。 ” “你在欺骗元首！ ”军事执政官愤怒地对科学执政官说， “你闭口 不提真正的危险！如果，质子被零维展开呢？ ” “零维？”元首饶有兴趣地问， “那就是一个有大小的点了。 ” “是的，奇点！一个质子与它相比都是无限大，这个质子的所有质 量将包含在这个奇点中，它的密度将无限大！元首，您当然能想象出这 是什么东西。 ” “黑洞？ ” “是的。 ” “元首，是这样”科学执政官连忙解释道， “我们选择质子而 不是中子进行二维展开，目的就是为了避免这种危险。万一零维展开真 地球往事 三体 281 的出现，质子带有的电荷也会转移到展开后形成的黑洞中，我们就能用 电磁力捕捉和控制住它。 ” “万一你们根本找不到它或控制不住呢？”军事执政官质问道， “它就可能降落到地面上来，在途中吸进遇到的一切物质迅速增加质 量，然后沉到我们行星的地心中，最后把整个三体世界都吸进去！ ” “这事情不会发生，我保证！你干吗总跟我过不去？我说过，科学实 验嘛……” “够了！ ”元首说， “下次的成功率有多大？ ” “几乎是百分之百！元首，请相信我，通过这两次失败我们已经掌 握了微观至宏观低维展开的规律。 ” “好吧，为了三体文明的生存，这个险必须冒。 ” “谢谢元首！ ” “但，如果下次还是失败，你，还有参与智子工程的所有科学家，都 有罪了。 ” “是的，当然，都有罪。 ”如果三体人能出汗的话，科学执政官一定 抹了一把冷汗。 对同步轨道上三维展开的质子的清理要比一维展开的质子容易得 多，用小型飞船就能把那一团团质子物质拖离行星近地空间，避免它们 进入大气层。那些像山脉一样的物质几乎没有质量，仿佛是巨大的银色 幻影，一个婴儿就能轻松地拖动它们。 事后，元首问科学执政官： “在这次实验中，我们是不是毁灭了微 观宇宙中的一个文明？ ” “至少是一个智慧体吧，而且，元首，我们毁灭的是整个微宇宙。那 个宇宙在高维度上是很宏大的，可能存在的智慧或文明显然不止一个， 只是它们没有机会向宏观世界表现自己而已。当然，在微观尺度的高维 空间，智慧和文明的形态是我们绝对无法想象的，它们完全是另一种东 西。还要说明：这种事可不是第一次发生了。 ” “哦？ ” 中国科幻基石丛书 282 “在漫长的科学发展史上，物理学家们用加速器撞击过多少质子？ 又撞击过多少中子和电子？可能不下一亿次吧。每一次撞击，对那个微 宇宙中的智慧或文明都可能是毁灭性的。其实，即使在大自然中，微宇 宙的毁灭也是每时每刻都在发生的，比如质子和中子的衰变，还有，进 入大气层的一束高能宇宙射钱就可能毁灭成千上万个微宇宙……您不 会为此多愁善感起来吧？ ” “你很幽默。我要马上通知宣传执政官，让他把这个科学事实向全 世界反复渲染，让三体人民明白，文明的毁灭，其实是一件在宇宙中每 时每刻都在发生的再普通不过的事。 ” “这有什么意义呢？是让人民能够坦然面对三体文明可能的毁灭 吗？ ” “不，是让他们坦然面对地球文明的毁灭。你也知道，在我们对地 球文明的基本政策公布后，激发起一些极其危险的和平主义情绪。我们 现在才发现，三体世界中像 1379 号监听员这样的人其实是很多的，必 须控制和消除这种脆弱的情绪。 ” “元首，这种情绪主要是由最近来自地球的新信息引起的。您的预 测实现了，地球上的异己力量果然在发展，他们建立了一个完全由自己 控制的发射基地，开始源源不断地向我们发送大量地球文明的信息。我 得承认，地球文明在三体世界是很有杀伤力的，对我们的人民来说，那 是来自天堂的圣乐。地球人的人文思想会使很多三体人走上精神歧途， 三体文明在地球已经成为一种宗教，而地球文明在三体世界也有这个 可能。 ” “你指出了一个巨大的危险，应该严格限制来自地球的信息流入 民间，特别是文化信息。 ” 质子二维展开的第三次实验在三十个三体时后进行，这次是在夜 间。从地面上看不到太空中的加速器圆环，只有旁边聚变发电站散热片 的红光标示出它的位置。加速器启动后不久，科学执政官就宣布展开成 地球往事 三体 283 功。 人们仰望夜空，开始什么都没看到，但很快，他们发现了一个神奇 的迹象：星空分成了两部分，这两部分中星群的图案是对不上的，仿佛 两张星空图片叠在一起，小的那张放在大的上面，银河在两者的边界处 被截断。小部分的星空是圆形的，正在正常的星空背景上迅速扩大。 “那里面的星座是南半球的！ ”文教执政官指着正在扩大的圆形星 空说。 当人们正在穷尽自己的想象力，试图理解在行星另一面才能看到 的星空是如何叠印到北半球的夜空上时，一个更惊人的景象出现了：在 那片扩大中的南半球星空移动的边缘，出现了一个巨大球体的一部分， 那个球体呈褐色，正在像一个速度很慢的显示屏上的图像一样被扫描 出来，那是一个大家都很熟悉的球体，上面清晰地呈现着熟悉的大陆形 状。当球体的显示完成后，它已占据了三分之一的天空，其表面的细节 可以看得更清楚了：褐色的陆地上布满了山脉的褶皱，一片片云层好像 是紧贴着大陆的残雪……这时才有人说出了一个事实： “那是我们的 行星！ ” 是的，太空中出现了另一个三体世界。 紧接着，天色亮了起来，在太空中的第二三体行星旁边，扩大的南 半球星空的边界又扫描出了一轮太阳。这显然是现在正照耀着南半球 的那个太阳，但似乎只有它的一半大小。 现在，终于有人悟出了事情的真相： “那是一面镜子！ ” 这面在三体世界上方出现的巨镜，就是那粒正在被展开成二维平 面的质子，这是一个没有厚度的真正意义上的几何平面。 当二维展开完成时，苍穹已完全被南半球的星空所覆盖，天顶正中 就是三体行星和太阳的镜像。紧接着，周围地平线一圈的星空开始变 形，群星的图像被拉长扭曲，像融化后流动一般。这种变形正由周边向 上发展。 “元首，质子平面正在我们星球的引力下弯曲。 ”科学执政官说，他 中国科幻基石丛书 284 接着指指星空中刚刚出现的许多光晕，就像有人用晃动的手电照着洞 窟的顶。 “那是从地面发出的电磁辐射，对平面的引力弯曲进行调节， 以使得质子平面最后把我们的星球完全包裹起来，之后电磁辐射仍将 持续发射，像许多根辐条一样维持住这个大球面的稳定，这样三体行星 就成了一个固定二维质子的工作平台，在质子平面上集成电路的蚀刻 就可以开始了。 ” 质子的二维平面对三体行星的包裹是一个漫长的过程，当星空的 变形逼近天顶的三体行星映像时，群星从上至下依次消失了，已弯曲到 行星另一面的质子平面挡住了星空，这时仍有阳光照进已弯曲成曲面 的平面质子内。可以看到三体世界的映像在太空中的宇宙哈哈镜里已 变得面目全非。当最后一缕阳光消失后，一切都隐入天边的黑暗中。这 是三体世界有史以来最黑的夜。在行星的引力和人工电磁辐射的平衡 下，质子平面形成了一个半径为同步轨道的大球壳，将行星完全包在球 心。 严寒降临了。全反射的质子平面将所有阳光反射回太空，三体世界 的气温急骤下降，最后降到了曾导致多轮文明毁灭的三颗飞星同现时 的程度。三体世界绝大多数公民脱水贮存，黑暗笼罩的大地上一片死 寂。天空中，只有维持质子巨膜的电磁辐射激发的微弱光晕在晃动，偶 尔还可以看到同步轨道上的几点灯光，那是在巨膜上进行集成电路蚀 刻的飞船。 微观组成电路的原理与普通集成电路完全不同，因为其基材不是 由原子构成的，它本身就是一个质子。电路的 PN结是对质子平面局部 的强互作用力进行扭结而形成， 导线也是传导核力介子的。 由于电路平 面极大，所以电路的宏观尺寸也很大，线路都有发丝粗细，凑近后用肉 眼清晰可辨。如果飞近质子平面，就能看到一个由精细复杂的集成电路 构成的广阔平原，电路的总面积是其包裹于其中的三体行星陆地面积 的几十倍。 质子电路蚀刻是一个庞大的工程，上千艘飞船工作了一万五千个 地球往事 三体 285 三体时才最后完成，软件的调试又用了五千个三体时，终于到了智子第 一次试运行的时刻。 在处于地下深处的智子控制中心的大屏幕上，当冗长的系统自检程 序结束后，接着显示系统的加载过程，最后，空白的蓝屏上出现了一 行大字： “微智慧 2.10”载入完成，智子一号等待指令。 科学执政官说： “现在，智子诞生了，我们赋予了一个质子智慧，这 是我们能够制造的最小的人工智能体了。 ” “可在我们现在看来，它是最大的人工智能体了。 ”元首说。 “元首，我们将增加这个质子的维度，它很快会变小的。 ”说完，科 学执政官在控制终端上输入一句询问： 智子一号，空间维度控制功能是否正常？ 正常，智子一号随时可以启动空间维度控制功能。 将维度收缩至三维。 这个命令发出后，包裹三体世界的二维质子巨膜迅速收缩，仿佛宇 宙中的一只巨手扯开了这个世界的蒙布，几乎在一瞬间，阳光普照大 地。质子由二维收缩至三维，变成了同步轨道上的一个巨球，看上去有 巨月大小，它正处于星球黑夜的一面，但镜面球面反射的阳光使黑夜变 成白昼。现在，外部世界仍然处于极度严寒中，控制室中的人们只能从 屏幕上目睹这一切。 维度收缩成功，智子一号等待指令。 将维度收缩至四维。 太空中，巨球迅速收缩，最后看上去只有飞星大小，在星球的这一 面黑夜重新降临。 “元首，我们现在看到的这个球体，不是真正的智子，只是其在三 维空间的投影。它是一个四维的巨人，我们的世界是一张三维的薄纸， 它站在这张纸上，我们只能看到它的脚底与纸相接触的部分。 ” 维度收缩成功，智子一号等待指令。 中国科幻基石丛书 286 将维度收缩至六维。 太空中的小球消失了。 “六维的质子有多大？”元首问。 “半径约五十单位吧。 ”科学执政官回答。 维度收缩成功。智子一号等待指令。 智子一号，你能看到我们吗？ 能，我能看到控制室，看到其中的每个人，还能看到每个人的内脏， 甚至还能看到你们内脏的内脏。 “它在说什么？”元首惊奇地问。 “智子从六维空间看三维空间，就像我们看二维平面上的一张画， 当然能看到我们的内部。 ” 智子一号，进入控制室。 “它能穿透地层吗？”元首问。 “元首，不是穿透，而是从高维进入，它可以进入我们世界中任何 封闭的空间。这也是三维中的我们和二维平面的关系，我们能轻易从上 方进入平面上的一个圆，而平面上的二维生物永远不可能，除非它打破 那个圆。 ” 科学执政官的话音刚落，一个镜面球体便出现在控制室的正中，悬 浮在半空中。元首走过去，看着全反射球面上自己变形的映像。 “这竟 是一个质子？ ！ ”他带着惊奇和感叹说。 “元首，这只是质子的六维实体在三维空间的投影而已。 ” 元首伸出手去，看看科学执政官并没有阻止，就接触了智子的表 面。在他的手这轻轻一触之下，智子被推移了一段距离。 “好像很光滑。它只有一个质子的质量，可我的手上竟有一点儿阻 力感。 ”元首不解地说。 “空气阻力作用于球体的原因。 ” “能让它缩回十一维，变成普通质子大小吗？”元首问。他的话音未 落，科学执政官惊恐地对智子喊道： 地球往事 三体 287 “注意，这不是指令！ ” 智子一号明白。 “元首，如果缩回十一维，我们就永远失去它了。当智子缩减到普 通微观粒子的大小时，它内部的传感器和 I/O接口将小于所有电磁波 的波长，这就意味着它无法感知宏观世界，也无法接收我们的指令。 ” “可我们最终是要让它恢复为一个微观粒子的。 ” “是的，但那要等到智子二号、三号和四号建成。一个以上的智子， 能够通过某些量子效应，构成一个感知宏观世界的系统。举个例子：假 设一个原子核内部有两个质子，它们相互之间会遵循一定的运动规则， 比如自旋，可能两个质子的自旋方向必须是相反的。当这两个质子被从 原子核中拆开，不管它们相互之间分离到多大距离，这个规则依然有 效；改变其中一个质子的自旋方向，另一个的自旋方向也必然立刻做出 相应的改变。当这两个质子都被建造成智子的话，它们之间就会以这种 效应为基础，构成一个相互感应的整体，多个智子则可以构成一个感应 阵列，这个阵列的尺度可以达到任意大小，可以接收所有频段的电磁 波，也就可以感知宏观世界了。当然，构成智子阵列的量子效应是极其 复杂的，我这种说明只是个比喻而已。 ” 其后三个质子的二维展开都是一次成功，每个智子的建造时间也 只有一号的一半。智子二号、三号和四号建成后，四个智子构成的量子 感应阵列也顺利建立。 元首和全体执政官再次来到了巨摆纪念碑下。在它们上方，悬浮着 四个已经缩至六维的智子，在每个晶莹的镜面球体中，都各自映出了一 轮正在升起的太阳，不由让人想起那些曾出现在太空中的三维体眼睛。 智子阵列，连续维度收缩至十一维。 指令发出后，四个镜面球体消失了。科学执政官说： “元首，智子一 号和二号将飞向地球，凭借着存贮在微观电路中庞大的知识库，智子对 空间的性质了如指掌，它们可以从真空中汲取能量，在极短的时间内变 中国科幻基石丛书 288 成高能粒子，以接近光速的速度航行。这看起来违反能量守恒定律，智 子是从真空结构中‘借’用能量，但归还遥遥无期，要等到质子衰变之 时，而那时离宇宙末日也不远了。 “两个智子到达地球之后， 第一个任务就是定位人类用于物理学 研究的高能加速器，然后潜伏于其中。在地球文明的科学水平上，对物 质深层结构研究所采用的基本方法，就是用经过加速的高能粒子撞击 选定的靶标粒子，当靶标粒子被撞碎后，对结果进行分析，以图找出反 映物质深层结构的信息。在实际的实验中，是用含有靶标粒子的物质作 为撞击目标，物质的内部几乎全是空的，如果一个原子有一座剧院那么 大，原子核则只是悬浮在剧院中的一个核桃。所以，成功的撞击是十分 罕见的，往往在大量的高能粒子长时间袭击靶标材料后才发生一次， 这种试验就像是从夏天的一场大暴雨中，找出颜色稍有不同的一个雨 点。 “这就给了智子一个机会，使它可以代替靶标粒子去接受撞击。由 于它具有很高的智能，通过量子感应阵列，它们能在极短的时间内精确 判断轰击粒子的轨迹，然后移动到适当的位置。所以，对智子撞击的成 功率，是对普通靶标粒子的上亿倍。当智子被撞击后，它就会有意给出 错误和混乱的结果，即使偶尔有对预定靶标粒子正确的撞击发生，地球 物理学家们也不可能将正确的结果从一大堆错误结果中分辨出来。 ” “这样，智子不是也被消耗了吗？”军事执政官问。 “不会的，质子已经是组成物质的基本结构，与一般的宏观物质是 有本质区别的，它能够被击碎，但不可能被消灭。事实上，当一个智子被 击碎成几部分后，就产生了几个智子，而且它们之间仍存在着牢固的量 子联系。就像你切断一根磁铁，却得到了两根磁铁一样。虽然每个碎片 智子的功能会大大低于原来的整体智子，但在修复软件的指挥下，各个 碎片能迅速靠拢，重新组合成一个与撞击前一模一样的整体智子。这个 过程是在撞击发生后，碎片智子在高能加速器气泡室或乳胶感光片上 显示出错误结果后完成的，只需百万分之一秒。 ” 地球往事 三体 289 又有人问： “是否存在这种可能： 地球人用某种方法将智子识别出 来，然后用一个强电磁场将其捕获，并禁锢起来？质子是带正电荷的。 ” “这更不可能了。要识别出智子，就需要人类在物质深层结构研究 上的突破，但高能加速器都变成了一堆废铁，这种研究又如何进行呢？ 猎人的眼睛已经先被他要射的猎物抓瞎了。 ” “地球人还有一个笨办法， ”工业执政官说， “他们可以建造大量 的加速器，超过我们建造智子的速度，那么，地球上总有某台加速器中 没有智子潜伏，会得到正确的结果。 ” “这是智子计划中最有趣的一点！ ”这个问题使科学执政官兴奋起 来， “工业执政官先生，您不必担心建造大量的智子会使三体世界的经 济崩溃。我们不必这么做，也许还会再建造几个智子，但不会更多，事实 上，有这两个就足够了，因为每个智子在行为上是多线程的。 ” “多线程？ ” “这是古老的串行计算机的一个术语，那时计算机的中央处理器 每一时刻只能运行单一的程序，但由于其速度很快，加上中断的调度， 在我们处于低速层面的观察者看来，计算机是在同时运行多个程序。你 知道，智子能以接近光速的速度运动，地球世界相对于光速而言是一个 很小的地方，如果智子以这个速度在地球上不同的加速器间巡回，那么 在地球人看来，它就像同时存在于每台加速器中，能够几乎同时在所有 加速器中制造错误的撞击结果。 “我们计算过，每个智子可以控制多达一万台次高能加速器，而地球 人建造一台这样的加速器就需要四五年的时间，从经济和资源的角度 看也不可能大量建造。当然，他们可以拉大加速器间的距离，比如说在 他们星系的各个行星上建造，这确实能破坏智子的多线程操作，但在这 样长的时间内，三体世界再造出十个或更多的智子也不困难。越来越多 的智子将在那个行星系中游荡，它们合在一起也没有细菌的亿万分之 一那么大，但却使地球上的物理学家们永远无法窥见物质深处的秘密， 地球人对微观维度的控制，将被限制在五维以下，别说是四百五十万 中国科幻基石丛书 290 时，就是四百五十万亿时，地球文明的科学技术也不会有本质的突破， 它们将永远处于原始时代。地球的科学已被彻底锁死，这个锁是如此牢 固，凭人类自身的力量是永远无法挣脱出来的。 ” “真是太妙了！ 请原谅我以前对智子工程的失敬。 ” 军事执政官由 衷地说。 “事实上，地球目前只有三台达到了可能取得突破性研究成果所 需能级的加速器，智子一号和二号到达地球后将几乎处于闲置状态。为 了充分利用它们的工作能力，除对三台加速器进行干扰外，我们还为智 子安排了其他的工作，它们将成为实施神迹计划的主要技术手段。 ” “智子能够制造神迹？ ” “对地球人而言，是的。大家都知道，高能粒子可以使胶片感光，这 也是地球原始的加速器显示单个粒子的手段之一，智子在高能态上每 穿过一次胶片，就在上面产生一个感光点，它们来回穿过，就可以将这 些点连成一排字母或数字，甚至图形，像绣花一样。这个过程速度极快， 远快过地球人的相机拍照时胶片的感光速度。另外，地球人的视网膜与 三体人类似，这样高能智子也能用同样的方式在他们的视网膜上打出 字母、数字或图形……如果说以上这些小神迹能使地球人迷惑和恐惧 的话，那下一个巨型神迹足以把那些虫子科学家吓死：智子能使他们眼 中的宇宙背景辐射发生整体闪烁。 ” “这对我们的科学家而言也很恐惧，怎样做到呢？ ” “很简单，我们已经编制了使智子自行二维展开的软件，展开完成 后，用那个巨大的平面包住地球，这个软件还可以使展开后的平面是透 明的，但在宇宙背景辐射的波段上，其透明度可以进行调节……当然， 智子进行各种维度的展开时，可以显示更宏伟的‘神迹’ ，相应的软件 也在开发中。这些‘神迹’将制造一种足以将人类科学思想引上歧途的 氛围，这样，我们可以用神迹计划对地球世界中物理学以外的科学形成 强有力的遏制。 ” “最后一个问题：为什么不把已有的四个智子全部发往地球呢？ ” 地球往事 三体 291 “量子感应是超距的，即使四个智子分处宇宙的两端，感应照样可 以在瞬间传递，它们构成的量子阵列依然存在。把三号和四号智子留在 这里，它们就可以实时接收位于地球的一号和二号智子发回的信息，这 样就实现了三体世界对地球的实时监视。同时，智子阵列也使三体世界 能够与地球文明中的异己分子进行实时通讯。 ” “这里有一个重要的战略步骤， ”元首插话说， “我们将通过智子 阵列，把三体世界对地球文明的真实意图告诉地球人。 ” “这就是说，我们将告诉他们，三体舰队将通过长期禁止地球人生 育，使这个物种从地球上消失？ ” “是的，这样做有两个可能的结果：其一是使地球人抛弃一切幻想 决一死战，其二是他们的社会在绝望和恐惧之中堕落、崩溃。通过对 已经收到的地球文明信息进行仔细研究，我们认为后一种可能性更 大。” 不知什么时候，初升的太阳又消失在地平线下，日出变成了日落， 三体世界的又一个乱纪元开始了。 就在叶文洁阅读三体世界的信息时，作战中心正在召开另一次重 要会议，对被夺取的信息进行初步研究。会前，常伟思将军说： “请同志 们注意，我们的会议现在可能已经在智子的监视之下了。以后，任何秘 密都将不复存在。 ” 他说这句话时，周围还是熟悉的一切，拉下的窗帘上摇曳着夏天的 树影：但在所有与会者眼中，这个世界已经不同于以往了，他们感觉到 了一双无所不在的眼睛盯着自己，在这双眼睛下，这个世界已经无处躲 藏。这感觉将缠绕他们一生，连他们的子孙后代也无法逃脱。人类要经 过许多年，才能在精神上适应这种处境。 就在常伟思说完这句话的三秒钟后，三体世界与地球叛军之外的 人类进行了第一次交流，这以后，他们就中断了与地球三体叛军降临派 的通讯。在所有与会者的有生之年，三体世界再也没有发来任何信息。 中国科幻基石丛书 292 这时，作战中心所有人的眼睛都看到了那个信息，就像汪淼看到倒 计时一样，信息只闪现了不到两秒钟就消失了。但所有人都准确地读出 了它的内容，它只有五个字 你们是虫子！,"3 3 T r i s o l a r i s : S o p h o n Eighty-five thousand T risolaran hours (about 8.6 Earth years) later The prin ceps had ordered an em er gency meeting of all T risolaran consuls. This was very unusual. Something important must have happened. T wenty thousand T risolaran hours ago, the T risolaran Fleet had launched. The ships knew the a pproximate direction of their tar get but not its d istance. It w as possible that the tar get was millions of light- hours away , or even at the other end of the galaxy . Faced with the endless sea of stars, the expedition had little hope. The mee ting of consuls occurre d under the Pendulum Monument. [As W ang M iao read about this epis ode, he couldn’ t help but recall the session at the UN Building in the Thr ee Body game. In reality , the Pendulum Monument was one of the few objects in the game that really did exist on T risolaris.] The princeps’ s choice of meetin g site confused most of the attendees. The Chaotic Era wasn’ t over y et, and a small sun had just ris en over the horizon, though it could also set at any moment. The temperature was cold, and all the atten dees were forced to wear fully enclosed elec tric-heating suits. The massive metal pendulum swung magnificently , pounding the frigid air . The sm all sun cast a long shadow against the ground, as if a giant whose h ead touc hed the sky wer e striding there. Under the watc hful eyes of the crowd, the princeps ascended onto the base of the pendulum and flipped a red switch.He turned to the consuls and said, “I have just shut of f power to the pendulum. It will gradually stop under the influence of air resistance.” “Princeps, why?” a consul asked. “W e all understand the historical significance of the pendulum. It’ s intended to hypnotize God. But now we know it’ s better fo r T risolaran civilization to have God awake, because God is now blessing us.” Everyone was silent, pondering the meaning of the princeps’ s words. After th ree more swings from the pendulum, someone asked, “Has the Earth responded?” The prin ceps no dded. “Y es. Half an hour ago I received the r eport. It was a response to the warning that was sent.” “So soon! Only eighty thousand hours have passed since then, which means … which means…” “Which means that the Earth i s only forty thousand light-hours from us.” “Isn’ t that the closest star from here?” “Y es. That is why I said God is blessing T risolaran civilization.” The attendees grew ecstatic, but they couldn’ t express the feeling, so the crowd seemed like a pent-up volcano. The princeps knew that allowing such weak emotions to explode would be dangerous. So he poured cold water on their sentiments. “I ha ve already ordered the T risolaran Fleet to turn toward this star . But things are not q uite as optimistic as you think. Given what we know , right now the fleet is sailing toward certain death.” The consuls calmed down. “Does anyone understand my conclusion?” “I do,” said the science consul. “W e’ve all studied the first m essages from Earth carefully . The sectio n most worthy of attention is their history . Let’ s ob serve th e facts: Humans took more than a hundred thousand Earth years to progres s from the Hunte r -Gatherer Age to the Agricultural Age. T o get from the Agricultural Age to the Industrial Age took a fe w thousand Earth ye ars. But to go from the Industrial Age to the Atomic Ag e took only two hundred Earth years. Ther eafter , in only a few Earth decades, they entered the Information Age. This civilization possesses the terrifying ability to accelerate their progress.“On T risolaris, of the more than two hundred civilizations, including our own, none has ever experienced such accelerating development. The progress of science and technology in all T risolaran civilizations has been at a constant or decelerating pace. In our world, each technology age requires approximately the same amount of time for steady , slow development.” The prin ceps nodded. “The fact is that four million and five hundred thousand hours from now , when the T risolaran Fleet has reached the Earth, that civi lization’ s technology le vel will have long surpassed ours, due to their accelerating development. The journey of the T risolaran Fleet is long and ardu ous, and the fleet must pass through two interstellar du st belts. It’ s very likely that only half of the ships will reach the Earth’ s so lar system, while the rest pe rish along the w ay . And then, the T risolaran Fleet will be at the mercy of a much more po werful Earth civilization. Thi s is not an expedition, but a funeral procession!” “But if this is true, Princeps, then there are even more frig htening consequences…” the military consul said. “Y es. It’ s easy t o imagine. The location of T risolaris has been e xposed. T o e liminate future threats, an interstellar fleet from Earth w ill launch a counterattack against us. It’ s very possible that long before an expanded sun swallows this planet, T risolaran civilization will have already been extinguished by humans.” The brig ht futur e had suddenly turned impossibly grim. The a ttendees fell silent. The prin ceps sa id, “What we m ust do next is contain the progress of science on Earth. Luckily , as soon as we received the first messages from Earth, we began to develop plan s to do so. As of now , we’ve discovered a favorable condit ion for realizing these plans: The response we j ust received was sent by an E arth traitor . Thus, we have reason to believe th at there are many al ienated forces within Earth civilization, and we must exploit such forces to the fullest.” “Princeps, that is not at all easy . W e have but a thin th read of communication with the Earth. It takes more than eighty thousand hours to complete an exchange.” “But remember that, like us, the knowledge that there are extrate rrestrial civilizations wil l shock all of Earth society and leave profound marks. W ehave rea son to believe that the alienated forces within Earth civilization will coalesce and grow .” “What can they do? Sabotage?” “Given a time g ap of forty tho usand hours, the strategic value of any traditional tactic s of war or terror is insignificant, and they can r ecover from them. T o ef fectively contain a civilization’ s development and disarm it across such a long span of time, there is only one way: kill its science.” The science consul said, “The p lan focuses on emphasizing the negative environmental ef fects of scientific development and showing signs of supernatural power to the population of Earth. In addition to highlighting the negative ef fects of progress, we’ll also attempt to use a series of ‘miracles’ to construct an illuso ry universe that cannot be explained by the logic of science. After these illu sions have been maintained for some time, it’ s possible that T risolaran civ ilization may become a tar get of religious worship there. Then, unscientifi c ways of thinking will dominate scientific thinking among human intellectuals, and lead to the collapse of the entire scientific system of thought.” “How do we create miracles?” “The ke y to miracles is that th ey cannot be seen as tricks. This may require that we transfer certain technologies far above current human technology level to the alienated forces on Earth.” “That’ s too risky! Who know s who will ultimately control such technologies? That’ s playing with fire.” “Of course, which specific technologies should be transferred to produce miracles requires further study .…” “Please hold on for a moment, S cience Consul,” said the military consul as he stood up. “Princeps, I am of the opinion that this plan wi ll be almost useless in terms of stopping human science.” “But it’ s better than nothing,” the science consul ar gued. “Barely ,” the military consul said contemptuously . “I agree with your view ,” the princeps said. “This plan w ill only interfere slightly with human scientific development. W e need a decisive act that will completely suf focate science on Earth and freeze it at its current level. Let’ s focus on the key here: Overall te chnological development depends on the advancement of basic science, and the foundation of basic science lies in the exploration of the deep structure ofmatter . If there’ s no progress in this field, there can be no major breakthrough in science and tec hnology as a whole. Of course , this is not specific to civilization on Earth. It is applicable to all tar gets that T risolaran civilization inten ds to conquer . W e had begun work in this area even before receiving the first extra-T risolaran communication. But we’ ve recently stepped up the ef fort. “Now , everyone, look up. What’ s that?” The princeps pointed at the sky . The consuls lifted their heads to gaze in that direction. They saw a ring in space giving of f a metallic glow in the sunlight. “Is that the dock for building the second space fleet?” “No. That’ s a lar ge particle ac celerator still under construction. The plans fo r building a second spa ce fleet have been scrapped. All resources are now devoted to Project Sophon.” “Project Sophon?” “Y es. W e’ve kept this plan secr et from most of you present. I now ask the science consul to give an introduction.” “I knew about this plan, but didn’ t know it had progressed so f ar .” The speaker was the industry consul. The cult ure and education consul said, “I knew about this plan as well, but thought it was like a fairy tale.” The scie nce consul said, “Project Sophon, to put it simply , aims to transform a proton into a superintelligent computer .”42 “This is a scie nce fantasy that most of us have heard abo ut,” the agricultural cons ul said. “But ca n it be realized? I know that ph ysicists can already manipulate nine of the e leven dimensions of the micro-scale world, but we still can’ t imagine how th ey could stick a pair of tiny tweezers into a proton to build lar ge-scale integrated circuits.” “Of course that’ s impossible. The etching of micro integrated circuits can only occur at the macro scale, and only on a macroscopic two- dimensional plane. Thus, we must unfold a proton into two dimensions.” “Unfold a nine-dimensional structure into two dimensions? How big would the area be?” “V ery big, as you will see.” The science consul smiled. * * *Another sixty thousand T risolaran hours went by . T wenty thousand T risolaran hours after the completion of the huge particle accelerator in space, the unfolding of the proton into two dimensions was about to begin in a synchronous orbit around T risolaris. It was a beautiful and mild Sta ble Era day . The sky was particularly clear . Li ke the day when the fl eet had set sail eighty thousand T risolaran hours ago, the entire population of T risolaris looked up into the sky , gazing at th at g iant ring. The princeps and all the consuls again cam e and stood under the Pendulum Monument. The pendulum had long stopped, and the weight hung still like a solid rock between the tall pillars. Looking at it, it was hard to believe that it had once moved. The science consul gave the o rder to unfold into two dimens ions. In space, three cubes drifted aro und the ringthe fusion generators that powered the accelerator . Their w inglike heat sinks gradually began to glow with a dim reddish light. The cr owd anxiously stared at the acc elerator , but nothing seemed to happen. A tenth of a T ris olaran hour later , the science consul held his ear piece to his ear and list ened intently . Then he said, “Princeps, unfortunately , the unfolding failed . W e reduced the dimensions by one too many , and the proton became one-dimensional.” “One-dimensional? A line?” “Y es. An infinitely thin line. T heoretically , it should be about fifteen hundred light-hours long.” “W e spent the resources inten ded for another space fleet,” said the military consul, “just to obtain a result like this?” “In scien tific experiments, there has to be a process during which kinks are worked out. After all, this w as the very first time the unfolding has been tried.” The crow d dispe rsed in disappointment, but the experiment wasn’ t over . Originally , it was thought that the one-dimensional proton would stay in synchronous orb it around T risolaris forever , but due to friction from solar winds, p ieces of the string fell back into the atmosphere. Six T risolaran hours later , everyone outside no ticed the strange lights in the air , gossamer threads that flickered in and out of existence. They soon learned from the news tha t this was the one-dimensional proton drifting to the ground under the influence of gravity . Even though the string was infinit ely thin, itproduced a field that could still reflect visible light. It was the first time people had ever seen matter not made out of atomsthe silky strands were merely small portions of a proton. “These things are so annoying.” The princeps brushed his hand against his face over and over . He and th e science consul were standing on the wide steps in front of Government Center . “My face always feels itchy .” “Princeps, the feeling is purely psychological. All the strings added together have the mass of a single proton, so it’ s impossible for them to have any ef fect on the macrosco pic world. They can’ t do any harm. It’ s as if they don’ t exist.” But the threads that fell from th e sky grew more numerous and denser . Closer to ground, tiny sparkling lights filled the air . The sun and the stars all appeared inside silvery halos. The strings clung to those who went outside, and as they walked, they dragged the lights behind them. When people returned indoors , the lines glim mered under the lamps. As so on as they moved, the reflection from the strings revealed the patterns in the air currents they disturbed. Although the one-dimensional string could only be seen under light and couldn’ t be felt, people became upset. The torrent of o ne-dimensional strings continued for more than twenty T risolaran hours before finally ending, though not because the strings had all fallen to the ground. Althoug h their mass was unimaginably minuscule, they still had some, and so their acceleration under gravity was the same as normal matter . However , once in side the atmosphere, they were completely dominated by the air currents and would never fall to the ground. After being unfolded into one dimen sion, the strong nuclear force within the proton became far more attenuated, weakening the string. Gradually , it broke into tiny pieces, and the light they reflected was no longer visible. People thought they had disappeared, but pieces of the one-dimensional string would drift in the air of T risolaris forever . * * * Fifty T ri solaran hours later , the second attempt to unfold a proton into two dimensions began. Soon, the crowd on the ground saw something odd. After th e heat sinks of the fus ion generators began to glow red, several colossal objects appeared near th e accelerator . All of them were in the formof regul ar geometric solids: spheres, tetrahedrons, cubes, cones, and so on. Their surfaces had complex col oration, but close examination showed that they were, in f act, colorless. The surfaces of the geometric solids were completely reflective, and what the people saw were just distorted, reflected images of the surface of T risolaris. “Have w e succeeded?” the princeps asked. “Is that the proton unfolded into two dimensions?” The science consul replied, “Princeps, it’ s still a failure. I just received the report from the accelerator control center . The unfolding left one too many dimensions in, and the proton was unfolded into three dimensions.” The gian t, reflective geometric solids continued to pop into existence in great numbers, and their forms b ecame more various. There were tori, solid crosses, and even something that looked like a Mbius str ip. All the geometric solids drifted away from the location of the accelerator . About half an hour late r , the solids fille d more than half the sky , as though a giant child ha d empti ed a box of building blocks in the firmamen t. The light reflected from the mirror surfaces doubled the brilliance of the light hitting the ground, but the intensity continuously shifted. The shadow of the giant pendulum flickered in and out, and swayed from side to side. Then, al l the geometric solids began to deform. They gradually lost their regular shapes, as though they were melting in heat. The deformation accelerated and the resulting lumps became more and more complex. Now the objects in the sky no longer reminded people of building blocks, but of a giant’ s dismembered limbs and disemboweled viscera. Because their shapes were no longer so regular , the light they reflected to the grou nd became softer , b ut their own surface coloration turned even more strange and unpredictable. Out of the mess of three-dimensional objects, a few in particular drew special a ttention from observers on the ground. At first, it was only because the objects in question were very similar to each other . But upon closer examination, people recognized them, and a wave of terror swept T risolaris. They we r e all eyes! [Of course, we don’ t know what T risolaran eyes look like, but w e can be certain that any intelligent life would be very sensitive to representations of eyes.] The prin ceps was one of the few who kept calm. He asked the science consul, “ How complicated can the internal structure of a subatomic particlebe?” “It depends on the number of dimensions of your observation perspective. From a one-dimensional perspective, it’ s only a pointthat’ s how ordinary people think of the particles. From a two - or three- dimensional perspective, the particle begins to show internal structure. From a four -dim ensional perspe ctive, a fundamental particle is an immense world.” The princeps said, “T o use a word like ‘immense’ to describe a subatomic particle such as a proton seems incredible to me.” The scie nce con sul ignored the p rinceps and continued, “As we move to higher dimensions, the compl exity and number of structures within a particle increase dramatically . The comparisons I’m about to make will not be precise, but should give you an idea of the scale. A particle seen from a seven-dimensional perspective has a complexity comparable to our T risolaran stellar system in three dimensions. From an eight-dimensional perspective, a particle is a vast presence like the Milky W ay . When the perspective has been raised to nine dimensions, a fundament al particle’ s internal structures and complexity are equal to the whole univ erse. As for even hig her dimensions, our physicists haven’ t been able to explore them, so we cannot yet imagine the degree of complexity .” The princeps pointed to the giant eyes in space. “Do these show that the microcosmos contained within the unfolded proton harbors intelligent life?” “Our definition of ‘life’ is probably not appropriate for th e high- dimensional mic rocosmos. More accurately , we can only say that universe contains intelligence or wisdom. Scientists have long predicted this possibility . It would have been odd for such a complex and va st world to not have evolved something akin to intelligence.” “Why h ave they transformed into eyes to look at us?” The princeps looked u p at the eyes in space , beautiful, lifelike sculptures, all of them gazing upon the planet below strangely . “Maybe they just want to demonstrate their presence.” “Can they fall down here?” “Not at all. Y ou may rest easy , Princeps. Even if they were to fall, the mass of all these huge structures added together is only that of a proton. Just like the one-dimensional string from last time, they won’ t have any ef fect on our world. People just have to get used to the strange sight.”But this time, the science consul was wrong. People n oticed the eyes moved faster than the other solids filling the sky , and they were gathering into one spot. Soon, two eyes met and mer ged into one bigger e ye. More and m ore eyes joined this big eye, and its volume grew . Fi nally , al l the eyes melde d into one. It was so lar ge that it seemed to represent the gaze of the universe upon T risolaris. The iris was clear and bright, a nd at the center was the image of a sun. Over the broad surface of the eyeb all, vari ous colors cascaded in a flood. Soon, the details over the giant eye faded a nd gradually disappeared, until it became a pup il-less blind eye. Then it beg an to deform u ntil it finally lost the shape of an eye and became a perfect circle. When the circle began to slowly rotate, people realized that it was not flat, but parabolic, like a slice cut fr om a giant sphere. As the military consul stared at the slowly spinning colossal object in space, he suddenly understood a nd shouted, “Princeps and others, please go into the under ground bunker right away .” He pointed upward. “That is” “A para bolic mirror ,” the princeps said calmly . “Direct the space defense forces to destroy it. W e will stay right here.” The parabolic mirror focused the sun’ s beams onto the surface of T risolaris. Initia lly , the spot of light was very lar ge, and the heat at the focal point wa sn’ t yet lethal. This spo t moved across the ground, sear ching for its tar get. The mirror discovered th e capital, the lar gest city of T risolaris, and the light spot began to move toward it. Soon, the beam was over the city . Those standing under the Pendulum Monument only saw a great brightness in space. It overwhelmed everything else, accompanied by a wave of extreme heat. Then th e light spot over the capital shrank as the parabolic mirror began to focus the light more tightly . The brightness from space grew stronger until no on e could lift up his head, and those standing within the spot felt the temperature rise rapidly . Just as the heat became unbearable, the edge of the ligh t spot swept past the Pendulum Monument and everything dimmed. It took a while before the crowd’ s sigh t readjusted to normal light. When th ey looked up, the first sight that greeted them was a pillar of light bet ween the sky and earth, shaped like an inverted cone. T he mirror in space formed the base of the cone, and the tip stabbed into the heart of the capital, turning everything ther e incandescent at once. W aves of smokebegan to rise. T o rnadoes caused by the uneven heat of the light c one formed several other pillars made of dust that connected to the sky , twisting and dancing around the light cone.… Several brilliant fireballs appeared in dif ferent parts of the mirr or , their blue col or distin ct from the ligh t reflected from the mirror . The se were the exploding nuclear warheads launched by the T risolaran space defense corps. Because the explosions were happening outside the atmosphere, there was no so und. By the tim e the fireballs disappeared, several lar ge holes ap peared in the mirror , and then the entire surface of the mirror began to tear and crack, until it had broken into more than a dozen pieces. The deadly light cone disappea red and the world returned to a normal level of illumination. For a moment, the sky was as dim as a moonlit night. Those broken pieces of the mirr or , now devoid of intelligence, c ontinued to deform a nd soon could not be distinguished from the other geom etric solids in space. “What will happen with the next experiment?” The princeps’ s expression was derisive as he spoke to the science consul. “W ill you unfold a proton into four dimensions?” “Princeps, even if that were to occur , it’ s nothing to worry a bout. A proton u nfolded into four dimensions will be much smaller . If the space defense corps is prepared to attack its projection in three-dimensional space, it can be destroyed just the same.” “Y ou’re deceiving the princeps!” said a furious military consul. “Y ou have not mentio ned the real danger . What if the proton is unfolded into zero dimensions?” “Zero dimensions?” The princeps was interested. “W ouldn’ t that be a point with no size?” “Y es, a singular ity! Even a prot on would be infinitely big compared to it. The entire mass of the proton will be contained in this singularity , and its density will be infinite. Princeps, I’m sure you can imagine what that would be.” “A black hole?” “Y es.” “Princeps, let me explain,” the s cience consul broke in. “The reason we picked a proton instead of a neutron to unfold into two dim ensions is precisely to avoid this kind of risk. If we really were to unfold into zerodimensions, the char ge of a proton would also be carried over into the unfolded black hole. W e can then capture and control it using electromagnetism.” “What i f you can’ t find it or co ntrol it?” the military consul as ked. “It can then land on the ground, su ck in everything it encounters, a nd increase its mass . Then it will sink into the core of this planet and eventually suck down all of T risolaris.” “That will never happen. I gua rantee it! Why are you always making things dif ficult for me? Like I said, this is a scientific experiment” “That’ s enough! ” the princeps said. “What is the probability of success next time?” “Almost one hundred percent! Princeps, please believe in me. Through these tw o failures, we have already mastered the principles governing unfolding subatomic structures into low-dimensional macro space.” “All rig ht. T o ensure the survi val of T risolaran civilization, we must take this risk.” “Thank you!” “But if you fail again, you an d all the scientists working on Project Sophon will be guilty .” “Y es, of course, all guilty .” If T risolarans could perspire, the science consul must have been soaked in cold sweat. It w as much ea sier to clean up the three-dimensional remnant s of the unfolded proton in synchronous orbit than it was to clean u p the one- dimensional stri ng. Small spaceships were able to drag the pieces of proton matter away from T risolaris and prevent them from entering the atmosphere. Those objects, som e as lar ge as mountains, had almost no mass. T hey were like immense silver illusions; even a baby could have moved them easily . Afterwards, the princeps asked the science consul, “Did we destroy a civilization in the microcosmos in this experiment?” “It was at least an intelligent b ody . Also, Princeps, we destroyed the entire microcosmos. That miniature universe is immense in higher dimensions, and it probably contained more than one inte lligence or civilization that never had a chance to express themselves in macro space. Of c ourse, in hi gher dimensiona l space at such micro scales, the form that intelligence or civilization may take is beyond our imagination. They’resomething else entirely . And such destruction has probably occurred many times before.” “Oh?” “In the long hist ory of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many ne utrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizat ions and intelligences in a microcosmos. In fact, eve n in nature, the destruction of universes must be happening at every secondfor example, through the decay of neutrons. Also, a high-ener gy cosmic ray entering the atmo sphere may destroy thousands of such miniature universes.… Y ou’re n ot feeling sentimental because of this, are you?” “Y ou amuse me. I will immediately notify the propaganda consul and direct him to r epeatedly publicize this scientific fact to the world. The people of T risolaris must unders tand that the destruction of civil izations is a common occurrence that happens every second of every hour .” “Why? Do you wish to encourage the people to face the possible destruction of T risolaran civilization with equanimity?” “No. It’ s to enco urage them to face the destruction of Earth civ ilization with equ animity . Y ou know very well that after we publicized our policy toward the Earth civilization, t here was a wave of extremely dangerous pacifism. W e have only now discovered that there are many like the listener of Post 1379. W e must control and eliminate these weak sentiments.” “Princeps, this is mainly the resu lt of recent messages received from the Earth. Y our prediction has com e true: The alienated forces on Earth really are grow ing. They have built a new transmission site completely under their control, and have begun to send us lar ge amounts of information about Earth civilizatio n. I must admit that their civilization has grea t appeal on T risolaris. For our people, it sounds like sacred music from Heaven. The humanism of Earth will lead many T risolarans onto the wrong path. Just as T risolaran civilization has already become a religion on Earth, Earth civilization has this potential on T risolaris.” “Y ou’ve pointed out a great danger . W e must strictly control the flow of information from the Earth to the populace, especially cultural information.”* * * The thir d attempt to unfold a proton into two dimensions began thirty T risolaran hours later . This time, it was at night. From the ground, it was impossible to see the ring of th e accelerator in space. Only th e red glow from the heat sinks of the fusi on reactors around it marked its location. Shortly after the accelerator was started, the science consul announced success. People gazed up at the night sky . Initially , there was nothing to see. But soon, th ey saw a miraculous sight: The heavens separated into two pieces. Between the two, the pattern o f the stars did not match, as though two photographs of the sky had been stacked together , with the smaller one overlaid on top of the big one. T he Milky W ay broke at the border between the two. The smaller portion of the star -studded firmament was circular , and it rapidly expanded against the normal night sky . “That co nstellation in there belongs to the southern hemisphere!” the culture and education consul said, pointing at the expanding, circular patch of the sky . As p eople exercised their imaginations to understand how stars that could be seen only from the other side of the planet were now superimposed over the northern hemisphere’ s view , an even more astonishing sight appeared: At the edge of the expanding patch of the night sk y from the southern hemisphere, a part of a giant globe appeared. The globe was brownish, and it was being revealed a stripe at a time, as though on a display w ith a very slow refresh rate. Everyone recognized the globe: On it were the clear outlines of familiar continents. By the time the entire globe came int o view , it already occup ied one-third of the sky . More details on the globe could be made out: the wrinkles of mountain ranges covering the brownish continents, the scattered cloud cover like patches of snow over the continents … Someone finally blurted out, “That’ s our planet!” Y es, another T risolaris had appeared in the sky . Next, th e sky brightened. Next to the second T risolaris in space, the expanding circle of the night sky from the southern hemisphere revealed another sun. This was clearly the same sun that currently was shining over the southern hemisphere, but it appeared at only half the size.Finally , someone figured it out. “It’ s a mirror .” The immense mirror that appear ed over T risolaris was the proto n being unfolded, a geometric plane without any meaningful depth. By the time th e unfolding was complete, the entire sky had been replaced by the reflection of t he night sky of the southern hemisphere. Directly overhead, the sky was dominated by the reflection of T risolaris and the sun. And then the sky began to deform just above the horizon all around, and the reflections of the stars stretched and twisted as though they were m elting. The deformation began at the edges of the mirror , but climbed up toward the center . “Princeps, the proton plane is b eing bent by our planet’ s gravity ,” the science consul said. He pointed to the numerous spots of light in the starry sky . They looked as though people were waving flashlights up at the domed vault. “Those are electromagnet ic beams being sent up from the ground to adjust th e curva ture of the plan e under gravity . The goal is to eventually wrap the unfolded proton completely around T risolaris. Afterwards, the electromagnetic beams will cont inue to hold up and stabilize this enormous sphere, like so many spokes. Thus, T risolaris will be the wo rkbench to secure th e two-dimensional prot on, and the work to etch electronic circuits on the surface of the proton plane can begin.” The process of wrapping the two-dimensional proton plane around T risolaris took a long time. By the time the deformation of th e reflection reached the image of T risolaris at the plane’ s zenith, the stars had all disappeared bec ause the proton plane, now curved around the other side of the p lanet, blocked them comple tely . Some sunlight continued to leak inside the c urved proton plane, and the image of T risolaris in this fun-h ouse mirror in sp ace was dis torted beyond recognition. But, finally , after th e last ray of sunlight was blocked, everything sank into the darkest night in the history of T risolaris. As gravity and the electromagnetic beams balanced each other , the proton plane formed a gigantic shell in synchronous orbit around T risolaris. Bitter cold followed. The completely reflective proton plane deflected all sunlight back into space. The temperature on T risolar is dropped precipitously , reaching levels co mparable to the appearance of three flying stars, wh ich had ruined many cy cles of civilization in the past. Most of the population of T risolaris dehydra ted and were stored. A deathly silence fellover mu ch of the darkness-enclo sed surface. In the sky , only the faint light spots fr om the beams that h eld up the proton membrane flickered. Occasionally , a few other tiny , sharp lights could be seen in synchronous orbit: the spaceships etching circuits into the gigantic membrane. The pr inciples governing m icro-scale integrated circuits were completely dif f erent from those of conventional circuits, as the base material wasn’ t made of atoms, but matter from a single proton. The “p-n junctions” of the circuits were formed by twisting the strong nuclear forces locally on the surface of the proton plane, and the conducting lines were made of mesons that could tran smit the nuclear force. Because the surface area for the circuit was extremely lar ge, the circuits were also very lar ge. The circ uit lines were as thick as hairs, and an observer close enough could see them with the naked eye. Flying close to the proton membra ne, it could be s een as a vast plane made of complex, elaborate integrated circuits. The total are a covered by the circ uits was dozens of times the area of the continents on T risolaris. Etching the proton circuits was a huge engineering feat, and th ousands of space ships worked for more than fifteen thousand T risolaran hours to complete it. The software debu gging process took another five thousand T risolaran hours. But finally , it was time to test the sophon for the first time. The big screen at the sophon co ntrol center deep under ground showed the progress of the long self-test sequence. Next came the loading of the operating system . Finally , the blank blue screen showed a line of lar ge-font text: Micr o-Intelligence 2.10 loaded. Sophon One r eady to a ccept commands. The scie nce con sul said, “A sop hon has been born. W e have endowed a proton w ith wis dom. This is the smallest artificial intelligence that we can make.” “But rig ht now , it appears as th e lar gest artificial intelligence,” said the princeps. “As soon as w e increase the dimensionality of this proton , it will become very small.” The science consul entered a query at the terminal: > Sophon One, are the spatial dimensionality controls operational?Af firmative. Sophon One is capable of in itiating spatial dimensionality adjustment s at any moment. > Adjust dimensionality to three. After this command was issued, the two-dimensional proton membrane that had wrapped itself around T risolaris began to shrink rapidl y , as though a giant’ s hand was pulling awa y a curtain over the world. In a moment, sunlight bathed the ground. Th e proton folded from two dime nsions into three and became a gar gantuan sphere in synchronous orbit, ab out the size of the giant moon. The sophon w as over the dark side of the planet, but the sunlight reflected from its mirror surface turned the night in to day . The surface of T risolaris was still extremely cold, so the crowd inside the control center could only observe these changes through a screen. Dimensionality adjustment successful. Sophon One is ready to accept commands. > Adjust dimensionality to four . In space, the gar gantuan sphere shrank until it eventually looked to be the size of a flying star . Night again descended over this side of the planet. “Princeps, the sphere we see now is not the complete sophon. It’ s only the proj ection of the sophon’ s b ody into three-dimensional space. It is, in fact, a giant in four -space, and our world is like a thin, three-dimensional sheet of paper . T he giant stands on this sheet of paper , and we can only see the trace where its feet touch the paper .” Dimensionality adjustment successful. Sophon One is ready to accept commands. > Adjust dimensionality to six. The sphere in the sky disappeared. “How big is a six-dimensional proton?” the princeps asked. “About fifty centimeters in radius,” the science consul replied. Dimensionality adjustment successful. Sophon One is ready to accept commands. > Sophon One, can you see us?Y es. I can see the control center , everyone inside, and the or gans inside everyone, even the or gans inside your or gans. “What is it saying?” The princeps was stunned. “A s ophon observing three-spac e from six-space is akin to us lo oking at a picture on a two-dimensional plane. Of course it can see inside us.” > Sophon One, enter the control center . “Can it go through the ground?” the princeps asked. “It’ s not exactly going ‘throug h.’ Rather , it’ s entering from a higher dimension. It can enter any enclosed space within our world. This is again similar t o the relationship between us, existing in three-space, and a two- dimensional plane. W e can easily enter any circle drawn on the plane by coming in from above. But no two-dimensional creature on the plane can do such a thing without breaking the circle.” Just as the science consul finished, a mirror -surfaced sphere appeared in the midd le of the control center , floating in air . The princeps w alked over and gazed at his own distorted reflection. “This is a proton?” He was amazed. “This is the six -dimensional body of the proton projected into three- space.” The princeps extended a hand. When he saw that the science consul did not obje ct, he touched the surfac e of the sophon. A very light touch pushed the sophon a considerable distance. “It’ s ver y smoot h. Even though it has only the mass of a proton, I could feel some resistance against my hand.” The princeps was puzzled. “That’ s due to air resistance against the surface of the sphere.” “Can you increase its dimensionality to eleven, and make it as small as a regular proton?” As s oon as the princeps said t his, the science consul shouted to the sophon, his voice tinged with fear , “Attention! This is not a command!” Sophon One understands.“Princeps, if we increased the dimensionality to eleven, we would lose it forever . When the sophon shrinks to the size of a regular subatomic particle, the internal sensors and I/O ports will be smaller than the wavelength of any electromagnetic radiation. That means it would not be able to sense the macro world, and would not be able to receive our commands.” “But we must eventually make it shrink back to a subatomic particle.” “Y es, but that must await the completion of Sophon T wo, Sophon Three, and Sophon Four . Multiple soph ons may be able to form a syst em to sense the m acro world through quantu m ef fects. For example, suppose a nucleus has two protons. The two of them will interact and follow certain patterns of m otion. T ake spin: Maybe the direction of spin of the two protons must be oppo site from each other . W hen these two protons are take n out of the nucleus, no matter how far apar t they are, this pattern will remain in ef fect. When b oth prot ons are made in to sophons, they will, based on this ef fect, create a mutual-sensing system. More sophons can then form a mutual- sensing formation. This formation’ s scale can be adjusted to an y size, and can thus receive electromagnet ic waves to sense the macro world at any frequency . Of course, the actual quantum ef fects necessary to c reate such a sophon formation are very complicated. My explanation is only an analogy .” * * * The unfolding of the next three protons into two dimensions su cceeded on the f irst try . The construction of each sophon also took only half as long as Sophon One. After the constru ction of Sophon T wo, Sophon Three, and Sophon Four , the quantum sensing formation was also created successfully . The princeps and all the cons uls once again came to the Pendulum Monument. Above them hovered four sophons shrunk to six-space. In the crystalline mirrored surface of each was an image of the rising sun, recalling the three-dimensional eyes that had once appeared in space. > Sophon formation, adjust dimensionality to eleven. After the command was issued, the four mirrored spheres disappeared. The science consul said, “Prince ps, now Sophon One and Soph on T wo willbe la unched toward the Earth. Using the lar ge knowledge base stored in the micro ci rcuits, t he sophons understand the nature of space. They can draw ener gy from the vacuum and b ecome high-ener gy particles in a moment, and nav igate thr ough space at n early the speed of light. This might appear to violate the law of conservation of ener gy , but in fact the sophons are only ‘borrowing’ ener gy from the structure of vacuum. However , the time for returning such ener gy is far in th e future, when the proton deca ys. By then, the end of the universe will not be far . “After the two sophons arrive on Earth, their first mission is to locate the high-ener gy particle acceler ators used by humans for physics research and hide within them. At the lev el of science development on the Earth, the basic me thod fo r exploring the d eep structure of matter is to use accelerated high-ener gy par ticles to collide with tar get particles. After the tar get particles have been smashed, they analyze the results to try to find information reflecting the deep structure of matter . In actual experiments, they use the substance containing the tar get particles as the bull’ s-eye for the accelerated bullets. “But the inside of the substan ce being struck is almost all vacuum. Suppose an atom is the size o f a theater; the nucleus is like a walnut hovering in the center of the theater . Thus, successful collisio ns are very rare. Oft en lar ge quantities of hi gh-ener gy particles must be directed against the t ar get substance for a sustained period of time before a colli sion occurs. This kind of ex periment is akin to looking for a raindrop of a slightly dif ferent color in a summer thunderstorm. “This gives the sophons an opening. A sophon can take the place of a tar get pa rticle a nd accept the co llision. Because they’re highly intelligent, they can precisely determine through the quantum sensing formation the paths that the accelerated particles will follow within a very short period of time an d move to the appropriate location. Thus, the likelih ood that a sophon will be s truck will be billions of times greater than the a ctual tar get particle. After a sophon is struck, it can deliberately give out wrong and chaotic r esults. Thus, even if the actual tar get particle is occasionally struck, Earth physicists will not be able to tell the correct result from the numerous erroneous results.” “W ouldn’ t this destroy the sophon as well?” asked the military consul.“No. When a sophon is smas hed into several pieces, several new sophons are born. And they cont inue to have secure quantum en tanglements between them, just like how , if you break a magnet in half, you would get two mag nets. Even though each partial sophon’ s capabilities will be much lower th an the original, whole sophon, under the direction of the self- healing software , the pieces will move together and reassemble into the original sophon. This process only requires a microsecond and will occur after the collision in the accelerator , and after the pieces of the sophon have left the wrong results in the bubble chamber or on sensitive film.” Someone asked, “W ould it be possible for Earth scientists to find a way to detect sophons and then use a strong magnetic field to imprison them? Protons have positive char ge.” “That’ s impossible. T o detect sophons requires humans to make breakthroughs in the study of the deep structure of matter . But their high- ener gy a ccelerators will all have been turned into heaps of junk. How can they make progress in such rese arch? The hunter ’ s eyes have a lready been blinded by the prey he intends to catch.” “Humans may still resort to a b rute-force method,” the industr y consul said. “They can build a lar ge nu mber of accelerators, faster than the rate at which we can build sophons. Then, at least some accelerators on Earth will not be infiltrated by sophons and can yield the correct results.” “This is one of the most intere sting aspects of Project Sophon!” The science consul was visibly ex cited by the question. “Mister Industry Consul, do not w orry that creating lar ge numbers of sophons will cause the collapse of the T risolaran economy . W e will not need to resort to that. W e might build a fe w more, but no t too many . Indeed, just these two are more than enough, because each sophon is capable of multitasking.” “Multitasking?” “This is a bit of jar gon related t o ancient serial computers. Back then, a computer ’ s cent ral processing unit could only carry out a single instruction at a time. But, because it was so fast, and aided by interrupt scheduling, from our low-speed perspective , the computer was carrying out multiple programs at the same time. As you know , the sophons move at close to the speed o f light. The surface of the Earth is a tiny space for sophons. If sophons patrol around the accelerators on Earth at this speed, then, from the perspective of humans, it is as if they simultaneously exist in all theaccelerators and can almost sim ultaneously create erroneous r esults in all the accelerators. “By our calculations, each sophon is capable of controlling more than ten thousand high-ener gy accelerators. It takes about four to five years for humans to build each of these accelerators, and it seems unlikely that they can be mass produced based on their economy and available re sources. Of course, they can increase the distance between the accelerators, for example, by building accelerato rs on the dif ferent planets in their planetary system. That would indeed d estroy the multitasking operation of the sophons. But in the time it would take to do that, it would not be dif ficult for T risolaris to build ten or more sophons. “More and more sophons will wander in that planetary system. Added all together , they still won’ t add up to the mass of even one-billionth of a bacterium. But they will cause the physicists on Earth to never be able to glimpse the secrets hidden dee p in the structure of matter . Humans will never be able to access the micro dimensions, and the ability for them to manipulate matt er will be limite d to below five dimensions. Fr om now on, whether it’ s four point five million hours or four hundred and fifty trillion hours, Earth civilization’ s technology will never achieve this fundamental breakthrough. T hey will remain forever in the primitive stage. The science of Earth has been completely lo cked down, and the lock is so secure that humans will never be able to escape from it by their own strength.” “That’ s wonderful! Please for giv e my lack of respect for Project Sophon in the past.” The military consul’ s tone was sincere. “In fact, there are currently only three accelerators with suf ficient power to produ ce results that can lead to possible breakthroughs. After Sophon One and Sophon T wo arrive on Earth, they will have a lot of extra capacity . In o rder to fully utilize the sophons, we will assign them oth er tasks in addition to interfering with the three accelerators. For example, they will be the main means to carry out the Miracle Plan.” “Sophons can create miracles?” “For humans, yes. Everyone knows that high-ener gy particles can expose f ilm. Th is is one of the ways that primitive accelerato rs on Earth once showed individual particles. When a sophon passes throug h the film at high ener gy , it l eaves behind a tiny exposed spot. If a sophon passes back and fort h through the film ma ny times, it can connect the dots to formletters o r numbers or even pictures, like embroidery . The proc ess is very fast, and far quicker than the s peed at which humans expose film when taking a picture. Also, the human retina is similar to the T risolaran one. Thus, a high-ene r gy sophon can also use the same technique to s how letters, numbers, or images on their retina.… And if these little miracles can confuse and terrify humans, then the next gr eat mir acle will be suf ficient to frighten their scientistsno better than bugsto death: Sophons can cause background cosmic radiation to flash in their eyes.” “This would be very frightening for our scientists as well. How would this be accomplished?” “V ery si mple. W e have already w ritten the software to allow a sophon to unfold itself into two dimensions. After the unfolding is comple te, the huge plane ca n wrap itself around the Earth. This software can also adjust the membrane so that it’ s transpare nt, but the degree of transpare ncy can be tuned in the frequencies of the cosmic microwave background.… Of course, as sophons fold and unfold into dif ferent dimensions, they can display even more amazing ‘miracles.’ The software for accomplishing these is still be ing developed, but these ‘miracles’ will create a mood suf ficient to divert human scientific thought onto the wrong path . This way , we can use the Miracle Plan to ef fectively restrain scientific endeavors outside of physics on Earth.” “One last question: Why not send all four of the completed sophons to Earth?” “Quantum entanglement can work at a distance. Even if four sophons were pla ced at opposite ends of the universe, they could still sense each other instantaneo usly , and the quantum formation between them would still exist. Keeping Sophon Three a nd Sophon Four here will ena ble them to receive the information sent back by Sophon One and Sophon T wo instantaneously . This gives us a way to monitor the Earth in real time. Also, the s ophon formation allows T ri solaris to communicate in real time with the alienated forces within Earth civilization.” Unnoticed, the sun that had just risen disappeared below the horizon and turned into a sunset. Another Chaotic Era had arrived on T risolaris. * * *While Y e W enjie was reading the messages from T risolaris, the Battle Command Cente r was hosting another important meeting to perform further analysis of the captured data. Before the meeting, General Chang said, “Comrades, please be aware that our meeting is probably already being monitored by sophons. From now on, there will be no more secrets.” When he said this, the surroundings were still familiar . The shadows of summer trees swayed against t he drawn curtains, but in the eyes of the attendees, the world was no longer the same. They felt the gaze of omnipresent eyes. Under these eyes, there was nowhere to hide in the world. This feeling would follow them all their lives, and their descendants would n ot be able to escape it. It would take many , many y ears before humans finally made the mental adjustment to this situation. Three seconds after General Chang finished his remark, T risolaris communicated w ith humanity outside the ET O for the first time. After this, they terminated all communications with the Adventists. For the remainder of the lives of all attendees, T risolaris never sent another message. Everyone in the Battle Comman d Center saw the message in their eyes, just like W ang Miao’ s countdown. The message flashed into existence for only two seconds and then disa ppeared, but everyone got it. It was only a single sentence: Y ou’r e bugs!"
地球往事 三体 293 35．虫 子 “看完那些，你一定想到了三年前因球状闪电研究发现的宏原子， 那可是你最辉煌的时代。 ” 汪淼对丁仪说， 他们此时正在丁仪家宽敞空 旷的客厅中，两人都靠在那张台球桌旁边。 “是啊，我一直在建立宏原子的理论，现在受到了启发：宏原子很 可能就是普通原子在低维度的展开。这种展开是由某种我们不知道的 自然力完成的，展开可能发生在宇宙大爆炸后不久，也可能现在仍然时 时刻刻都在进行。也许，这个宇宙所有的原子在漫长的时间里最后都会 展开到低维，我们宇宙的最终结局是变成低维度原子构成的宏宇宙，这 也可以看作一个熵的增长过程吧……当时以为，宏原子的发现能给物 理学带来突破，现在看来根本不是那么回事。 ”丁仪说，起身到书房去 翻找什么。 “为什么呢？既然我们可以捕获宏原子，难道不能绕开高能加速 器，直接从宏原子中研究物质的深层结构吗？ ” “当初是这么想的， ” 丁仪从书房中走出来， 手里拿着一个精致的 银边相框， “现在看来很可笑。 ” 他弯腰从脏乱的地板上拾起一个烟头， “还是看这个过滤嘴吧。 我们说过它的二维面积展开来有客厅这么大， 但要是真的展开了，你能从那个平面上研究出过滤嘴曾经的三维结构 吗？当然不可能，那些三维结构的信息在展开时已经消失了，像打碎了 的杯子不可能还原，原子在自然状态下的低维度展开是不可逆的过程。三 体科学家的高明之处，在于他们对粒子低维展开的同时保留了高级结 构的信息，使整个过程成为可逆。而我们要研究物质深层结构，还只 中国科幻基石丛书 294 能从十一维微观维度开始，也就是说，离不开加速器。打个比方：加速器 是我们的算盘和计算尺，只有通过它们，我们才可能发明出电子计算机 来。 ” 丁仪让汪淼看那个相框中的照片。照片上，一名年轻美丽的少校女 军官站在一群孩子们中间，她目光清澈，动人地微笑着。她和孩子们站 在一片修剪得很好的绿草坪上，上面有几只白色的小动物。在他们的后 面，有一幢很高大的厂房一样的建筑，墙上画着色彩鲜艳的卡通动物， 还有气球、鲜花什么的。 “在杨冬之前认识的？你的生活够丰富的。 ”汪淼看着照片说。 “她叫林云，对球状闪电研究和宏原子的发现做出过关键性的贡 献，可以说， 没有她， 就没有这个发现。 ” “我没有听说过她啊。 ” “是啊，因为一些你同样没听说的事情……不过我一直觉得这对 她不公平。 ” “她现在在哪儿？ ” “在……在一个地方，或一些地方……唉，她要是现在能出现有多 好。 ” 对丁仪奇怪的回答，汪淼没有在意，他对照片上的那个女性也不感 兴趣，他把相框还给丁仪，一摆手说： “无所谓，一切都无所谓了。 ” “是啊，一切都无所谓了。 ”丁仪把相框在台球桌上端正地摆好，看 着他，伸手去够桌角的一瓶酒…… 当史强推门进来时，两人已经喝得有八分醉了，他们看到大史后都 很兴奋。汪淼站起来搂住来者的双肩， “啊，大史，史警官……”丁仪则 晃晃悠悠地找了个杯子放到台球桌上，给他倒酒， “你那个邪招还不如 不出。那个信息，我们看不看，四百多年后的结果都一样。 ” 大史在台球桌前坐下来， 两眼贼溜溜地看看两人： “事情真像你们 说的那样，什么都完了？ ” “当然，什么都完了。 ” 地球往事 三体 295 “加速器不能用，物质结构不能研究，就什么都完了？ ” “那你说呢？ ” “技术不还是在进步嘛，汪院士他们还搞出了纳米材料……” “想象一个古代的王国，他们的技术也在进步，能为士兵造出更好 的刀啊剑啊长矛啊，甚至还有可能造出像机关枪那样连发的弓箭呢，但 ……” 大史若有所思地点点头， “但如果他们不知道物质是由原子、分子 组成的，就永远造不出导弹和卫星，科学水平限制着呢。 ” 丁仪拍拍大史的肩， “我早就看出来史警官是个聪明人，就是看着 ……” 汪淼接着说： “物质深层结构的研究是其他一切科学基础的基础， 如果这个没有进展，什么都是用你的说法：扯淡。 ” 丁仪指指汪淼： “汪院士这辈子还不会闲着，能继续改进刀啊剑啊 长矛啊。我他妈的以后干什么？天知道！ ”说着他把一个空酒瓶扔到桌 上，捡起台球丢过去砸。 “这是好事！ ”汪淼举起酒杯说， “我们这辈子反正能打发完，今 后，颓废和堕落有理由了！我们是虫子！即将灭绝的虫子，哈哈……” “说得好！ ”丁仪也举起酒杯， “为虫子干杯！真没想到世界末日是 这么的爽，虫子万岁，智子万岁！末日万岁！ ” 大史摇摇头，把面前他那杯酒一口干了，又摇摇头， “熊样儿。 ” “那你要咋的？”丁仪用醉眼盯着大史说， “你能让我们振作起 来？” 大史站了起来： “走。 ” “去哪儿？ ” “找振作啊。 ” “得了史兄，坐下，喝。 ” 大史扯着两人的胳膊把他们拽起来： “走，不行就把酒拿上。 ” 下楼后，三人上了大史的车。当车开动时，汪淼大着舌头问去哪儿， 中国科幻基石丛书 296 大史回答： “我老家，不远。 ” 车开出了城市，沿京石高速向西疾驶，刚刚进入河北境内就下了高 速公路。大史停下了车，把车里的两人拖出来。丁仪和汪淼一下车，午后 灿烂的阳光就令他们眯起了眼，覆盖着麦田的华北大平原在他们面前 铺展开。 “你带我们来这儿干什么？”汪淼问。 “看虫子。 ” 大史点上一根斯坦顿上校送的雪茄说， 同时用雪茄指 指面前的麦田。 汪淼和丁仪这才发现，田野被厚厚的一层蝗虫覆盖了，每根麦秆上 都爬满了好几只，地面上，更多的蝗虫在蠕动着，看去像是一种黏稠的 液体。 “这地方也有蝗灾了？”汪淼赶走田埂一小片地上的蝗虫，坐了下 来。 “像沙尘暴一样，十年前就有了，不过今年最厉害。 ” “那又怎么样？大史，什么都无所谓了。 ”丁仪带着未消的醉意说。 “我只想请二位想一个问题：是地球人与三体人的技术水平差距 大呢，还是蝗虫与咱们人的技术水平差距大？ ” 这个问题像一瓢冷水泼在两名醉汉科学家头上，他们盯着面前成 堆的蝗虫，表情渐渐凝重起来，两人很快就明白了大史的意思。 看看吧，这就是虫子，它们的技术与我们的差距，远大于我们与三 体文明的差距。人类竭尽全力消灭它们，用尽各种毒剂，用飞机喷洒，引 进和培养它们的天敌，搜寻并毁掉它们的卵，用基因改造使它们绝育； 用火烧它们，用水淹它们，每个家庭都有对付它们的灭害灵，每个办公 桌下都有像苍蝇拍这种击杀它们的武器……这场漫长的战争伴随着整 个人类文明，现在仍然胜负未定，虫子并没有被灭绝，它们照样傲行于 天地之间，它们的数量也并不比人类出现前少。把人类看作虫子的三体 人似乎忘记了一个事实：虫子从来就没有被真正战胜过。 地球往事 三体 297 太阳被一小片黑云遮住了，在大地上投下一团移动的阴影。这不是 普通的云，是刚刚到来的一大群蝗虫，它们很快开始在附近的田野上降 落，三个人沐浴在生命的暴雨之中，感受着地球生命的尊严。丁仪和汪 淼把手中拎着的两瓶酒徐徐洒到脚下的华北平原上，这是敬虫子的。 “大史，谢谢你。 ”汪淼向大史伸出手去。 “我也谢谢你。 ”丁仪握住了大史的另一只手。 “我们快回去吧，有好多工作要做呢。 ”汪淼说。,"3 4 B u g s By t he t ime Shi Qiang entered the door of Ding Y i’ s home, W an g Miao and Ding Y i were already very drunk. The two were ex cited to see Shi Qiang. W ang stood up and hug ged the newcomer ’ s shoulders. “Ah, Da Shi, Of ficer Shi…” Ding, who couldn’ t even stand straight, found a glass and put it on the pool tab le. He poured some liq uor into it, and said, “Y our out-of-the-box thinking was not helpful. Whet her we look at those messages or not, the result four hundred years from now will be the same.” Da S hi sat down in front of the pool table, glancing at the tw o with a crafty gaze. “Is it really like you say? Everything’ s over?” “Of course. It’ s all over ,” Ding said. “Y ou ca n’ t use the accelerators and can’ t study the structure of matter . That means it’ s all over?” Da Shi asked. “Um … what do you think?” “T echnology is still making progress. Academician W ang and his people just created the nanomaterial” “Imagine an ancient kingdom , if you will. Their technology is advancing. They can invent better swords, knives, spears, et cetera. Maybe they can even invent auto-repeating crossbows that can shoot many arrows like a machine gun” Da Shi nodded, understanding. “But if they don’ t know that matter is made from molecules and ato ms, they will never create m issiles andsatellites. They’re limited by their level of science.” Ding pa tted Da Shi on the shoulder . “I always knew that our Of ficer Shi was smart. It’ s just that you” W ang took over . “The study of the deep structure of matter is the foundation of the foundations of all other sciences. If there’ s no progress here, everything elseI’ll put it your wayis bullshit.” Ding po inted at W ang. “Academ ician W ang will be busy for the rest of his life, and continue to improve our swords and knives and spears. What the f uck am I goin g to do? Who the hell know s?” He threw an empty bottle onto the table and picked up a billiard ball to smash it. “This is a good thing!” W ang lifted his glass. “W e will be abl e to live out the rest of our lives one way or another . After this, dec adence and depravity can be justified! W e’r e bugs! Bugs that are about to go extinct! Haha…” “Exactly!” Ding also lifted his g lass. “They think so little of us that they don’ t even bother to disguise their plans for us, telling the Adventists everything. It’ s like how you don ’ t need to hide the bottle of bug spray from the little critters . Let’ s toast the bugs! I never thought the end of the world would fe el so good. Long live b ugs! Long live sophons! Long live the end of the world!” Da S hi shook hi s head and drai ned the glass. He shook his head again. “Bunch of pussies.” “What d o you want?” Ding stared at Da Shi drunkenly . “Y ou th ink you can cheer us up?” Da Shi stood up. “Let’ s go.” “Where?” “T o find something to cheer you up.” “Whatever , buddy . Sit back down. Drink.” Da Shi took the two by their arms and dragged them up. “L et’ s go. Bring the liquor if you have to.” Downstairs, the three got into Da Shi’ s car . As the car starte d, W ang asked in slurred speech where they were going. Da Shi said, “My hometown. Not too far .” The car left th e city and sped west along the Beijing-Shiji azhuang Highway . It exited the highway as soon as they were inside Hebei Province. Da Shi stopped the car and dragged his two passengers out.As s oon as Ding and W ang got out of the car , the bright afternoon sun made th em squi nt. The wheat f ields of the North China Plain spread out before them. “What did you bring us here for?” W ang asked. “T o look at bugs.” Da Shi lit one of the cigars Colonel Stanton had given him and pointed at the wheat fields with it. W ang an d Ding now noticed that the fields were covered by a layer of locusts. Every wheat stalk had a few crawling over it. On the ground, more locusts wriggled, like some thick liquid. “They’re plague d by locusts he re?” W ang brushed away some locusts from a small area near the edge of the field and sat down. “Like th e dust storms, they sta rted ten years ago. But this year is the worst.” “So wha t? Nothing matters now , Da Shi.” Ding spoke, his voice still drunk. “I just want to ask the two of you one question: Is the technological gap between humans and T risolarans greater than the one between locusts and humans?” The question hit the two scientists like a bucket of cold water . As they stared at the clumps of locusts before them, their expressions grew solemn. They got Shi Qiang’ s point. * * * Look at them, the bugs. Humans have used everything in their power to extinguish them : every kind o f poison, aerial sprays, introducing and cultivating their natural predators, searching for and destroying their eggs, using genetic modification to sterilize them, burning with fire, drowning with water . Every family has bug spray , every desk has a flyswatter under it … this long war has been going on for the entire history of human civilization. But the outcome is still in doubt. The bugs have not been eliminated. They still proudly live between the heavens and the earth, and their numbers have not diminished from the time before the appearance of the humans. The T risolarans who deemed the humans bugs seemed to have for gotten one fact: The bugs have never been truly defeated.A small black cloud covered the sun and cast a moving shadow against the g round. This was not a common cloud, but a swarm of locu sts that had just arrived. As the swarm land ed in the fields nearby , the three men stood in th e middle of a living shower , feeling the dignity of life on Earth. Ding Y i and W ang Miao poured the two bottles of wine they had w ith them on the ground beneath their feet, a toast for the bugs. “Da Shi, thank you.” W ang held out his hand. “I thank you as well.” Ding gripped Da Shi’ s other hand. “Let’ s get back,” W ang said. “There’ s so much to do.”"
中国科幻基石丛书 298 36．尾声遗址 谁也不相信叶文洁能够凭着自己的体力再次登上雷达峰，但她最 后还是做到了，一路上没有让别人搀扶，只是在山腰间已经废弃的岗亭 中休息了两次。她在毫不怜惜地消耗着自己已不可再生的生命力。 得知三体文明的真相后，叶文洁沉默了，很少说话，她只提了一个 要求：想回红岸基地遗址看看。 当一行人登上山时，雷达峰的峰顶刚刚探出云层，在阴霾的雾气中 行走了一天，现在一下子看到了在西天灿烂照耀着的太阳和湛蓝的晴 空，真像登入另一个世界。 从峰顶上极目望去，云海在阳光下一片银白，那起伏的形状，仿佛 是云下的大兴安岭某种形而上的抽象再现。 人们想象中的废墟并不存在，基地被拆除得十分彻底，峰顶只剩下 一片荒草，地基和道路都被掩于其下，看上去只是一片荒野，红岸的一 切仿佛从未发生过。 但叶文洁很快发现了一处遗迹，她走到一块高大的岩石边，拨开了 上面丛生的藤蔓，露出了斑驳的铁锈，其他人这才发现“岩石”原来是 一个巨大的金属基座。 “这是天线的基座。 ” 叶文洁说。 地球文明被外星世界听到的第一 声呼唤，就是通过这个基座上的天线发向太阳，再由太阳放大后向整个 宇宙转发的。 人们在基座旁发现了一块小小的石碑，它几乎被野草完全埋没。上 书： 地球往事 三体 299 红岸基地原址 （1968～1987） 中国科学院 1989.03.21 碑是那么小，与其说是为了纪念，更像是为了忘却。 叶文洁走到悬崖边，她曾在这里亲手结束了两个军人的生命。她并 没有像其他同行的人那样眺望云海，而是把目光集中到一个方向，在那 一片云层下面，有一个叫齐家屯的小村庄…… 叶文洁的心脏艰难地跳动着，像一根即将断裂的琴弦，黑雾开始在 她的眼前出现，她用尽生命的最后能量坚持着，在一切都没入永恒的黑 暗之前，她想再看一次红岸基地的日落。 在西方的天际，正在云海中下沉的夕阳仿佛被融化了，太阳的血在 云海和天空中弥散开来，映现出一大片壮丽的血红。 “这是人类的落日……”叶文洁轻轻地说。,"3 5 T h e R u i n s No o ne believed that Y e W enjie could climb Radar Peak by her self, but she did it anyway . She didn’ t allow anyone to help her along the way , only resting a couple of times in the abandoned sentry posts. She consumed her own vitality , the vitality that could not be renewed, without pity . After lea rning the truth of T riso laran civilization, Y e had become silent. She rare ly spoke, but did make one request: She wanted to visit the ruins of Red Coast Base. When the group of visitors ascended Radar Peak, its tip had just emer ged from the cloud cover . After walking a whole day in the foggy haze, seeing the bright sun in the west and the clear blue sk y was like climbing into a new world. From the top of the peak, the clouds appeared as a silver -white sea, and the r ise and fall of the waves seemed like abstractions of the Greater Khingan Mountains below . The ruin s that the visitors had imagined did not exist. The base h ad been dismantled thoro ughly , and only a patch of tall grass was left at the top. The foundations and the roads were buried below , and the whole place appeared to be a desolate wilderness. Red Coast seemed to have never happened. But Y e soon discovered someth ing. She walked next to a tall r ock and pulled a way the vines covering it, revealing the mottled, rusty surface below . Only now did the visitors understand that the rock was actually a lar ge metallic base.“This w as the base for the antenna,” Y e said. The first cry fro m Earth heard by an extraterrestrial world was sent from the antenna that had been here to the sun, and then, amplified, broadcast to the whole universe. They discovered a small stone tablet next to the base, almost completely lost in the grass. S ITE OF R ED C OAST B ASE (19681987) C HINESE A CADEMY OF S CIENCES 1989.03.21 The tabl et was so tiny . It didn’ t seem so much a memorial as an attempt to for get. Y e walked to th e lip of the clif f. Here, she had once ended the lives of two soldiers with her own hands. She did not look over the sea of clouds as the othe rs were doing, but focu sed her gaze in one direction. Below the clouds, there was a small village called Qijiatun. Y e’ s heart beat with ef fort, lik e a string on some musical ins trument about to break. Black fog appea red before her eyes. She used the last bit of her strength to stay upright. Before everything sank into darkness, she wanted to see sunset at Red Coast Base one more time. Over the western horizon, the sun that was slowly sinking into the sea of clouds seemed to melt. The ruddy sun dissolved into the clouds and spread over the sky , illuminating a lar ge patch in magnificent, bloody red. “My sunset,” Y e whispered. “And sunset for humanity .”"
"《狂傲仙魔途》是一本 YY 种马小说。 说具体点，《狂傲仙魔途》是一本奇长无比、金手指逆天、后宫直逼三位数、书中角色凡 是性别为女都会倾心主角的打怪流修真爽文。 本年度最火爆的种马小说，没有之一！ 这本书的男主洛冰河，不走龙傲天流，不走废柴流，却仍旧风靡终点文学网万千读者，影 响了无数后来 YY 小说的跟风模仿。 他走的是暗黑系路线。 而在黑化之前，他走的是苦情系路线。 下面，就让本书的资深读者沈垣省略无数杀必死内容，把数千万字的鸿篇巨作为大家简洁 地概括一下。 洛冰河生下来就为父母所弃，以白布包裹，置于木盆之中，顺水而下。 数九寒天，被江中渔人捞起才没活活冻死幼年夭亡。因为他漂流在洛川上，又是满河薄冰 的时节，就被取了这个名字。 幼年在街头流浪，吃不饱，穿不暖，童年灰暗。一名大户人家的洗衣妇瞧这孩子可怜，又 膝下无子，便收养了他，当作自己亲儿拉扯长大。母子贫苦，在豪门寄人篱下受尽欺辱。 从小极不健康的成长环境，为洛冰河黑化后锱铢必较、睚眦必报、心里杀千刀、嘴上笑说 好的扭曲性格埋下了祸根。 为了一碗半冷不热的肉粥，他撑过府上公子哥儿们的殴打，最后却还是迟了一步，没能在 养母临终之前让她尝上一口。 在机缘巧合之下，洛冰河被当世四大修仙门派之一的苍穹山派选中，拜入 “ 修雅剑 ” 沈清秋 一脉。 他还以为从此终于能步入正轨，却不料沈清秋金玉其外，败絮其中，人品低劣。他嫉妒洛 冰河举世无双的绝佳天资，内心畏惧这个每日修为都能突飞猛进的弟子，总是百般嘲讽， 千般作践，连带同门也一起对他看轻。 求学几年，忍辱负重，又是一部心酸血泪史。 洛冰河艰难坎坷地长到十七岁，终于迎来了修真界三年一度的盛典仙盟大会。在这场仙盟 大会中，洛冰河被沈清秋暗算，坠入了魔界和人界交界处的裂缝  无间深渊。 是的，这才是故事的开始！ 洛冰河非但没有死，反而在无间深渊里找到了属于他的绝世奇剑 “ 心魔 ” 。也从而获悉自己 的身世。 原来，洛冰河乃是魔界圣君与人界女子结合的后代，身上同时流着上古堕天之魔一脉和人 族的鲜血。其生父天琅君被镇压于高山之下，永世不得翻身。生母则是修真名门正派的弟 子，可能当年因与魔族私通被逐出师门，诞下洛冰河后死于产后大出血。临终前，她把亲 儿从生产的孤船上放下，这才留给了洛冰河一线生机。 洛冰河用心魔剑解开了自己身上魔族血脉的封印，在黑暗的深渊之下潜心修炼，悟出了不 世神功，重回苍穹山派。 从这里开始，洛冰河一步一步朝黑化之路义无返顾地前进。 昔日仇敌，无一不惨死他手，受尽折磨。洛冰河用他越来越擅长的伪装与心术之道，两面 三刀，阳奉阴违，一步一步，骗取信任，夺取权力，扶摇直上，掀起腥风血雨的滔天海 浪。随着剧情的发展，洛冰河的黑化也越来越严重。他回归魔界继承了圣君之位，仍不满 足，开始了对人界各大修真门派的血洗和剿杀，将反对他的一切声音斩草除根！ 最终，一代仙魔传奇洛冰河，一统三界万里河山，坐拥后宫无数，子子孙孙无穷尽也！ “ 傻逼作者傻逼文！ ” 这是沈垣咽气之前，最后能骂的一句话。 想他一个规规矩矩花钱买 V 看正版的大好青年，临终之前坚持看完的居然是这样一本种马 程度令人发指咋舌的骗钱注水文，他能不骂吗？ 《狂傲仙魔途》，作者：向天打飞机。 光看这个 ID ，就有一股淫邪之气扑面而来。小学生文笔，雷点遍地。沈垣都不好意思称 作者构造的那个乱七八糟、狗屁不通的框架为修真设定。 你见过整天骑马坐车的修真？你见过辟谷了都要吃饭睡觉的修真？你见过作者连筑基和元 婴有时候都能搞混的修真？ 每一个人，在主角面前，都像被他的王八之气吞掉了智商。尤其是洛冰河的师父，那个沈 清秋，简直是弱智中的战斗机，人渣中的李天一！他存在的意义，就是为了作死，然后作 死不成，被主角弄死。 那么沈垣到底为什么要看这样一本书，还看到了最后？ 不要误会，沈垣可不是犯贱。这个原因，也是最让他蛋疼的： 这篇文伏笔无数，大坑遍地，一个又一个的谜团，层层迷雾扑朔迷离。结果到了最后  一个都没有解开！ 简直当空一口凌霄血。 为什么奇珍异草灵丹妙药和绝世美女一样满地跑不要钱？为什么反派连作死和便当的台词 和姿势都千篇一律？ 那好几个惊鸿一瞥的妹子说好要收入后宫的结果人呢 …… 好吧这个姑且略过  那好几桩 惨案的凶手到底是谁？那一大堆名号响当当说得牛逼无比的角色到底是用来干嘛的，为什 么到最后都没见到拉着溜出来瞧瞧？！ 向天哥，飞机哥，菊苣，咱能打个商量，填！坑！好！么！ 沈垣觉得他简直能给气活过来。 无尽的黑暗中，一个机械的声音在他耳边回响。 【激活码： “ 傻逼作者傻逼文 ” 。自动触发系统。】 “ 阁下哪位？ ” 说话腔调跟谷歌翻译似的。 沈垣望了望四周，他像是漂浮在一个虚拟空间里，伸手不见五指，那个声音无处不在： 【欢迎贵方进入系统。本系统本着 “noBB” 的开发理念，希望为您提供最佳体验。衷心希 望体验过程中，贵方能得偿所愿，将一篇傻逼文按照您的意愿，改造成高端、大气、上档 次的经典之作。祝您愉快。】 眩晕之中，有个男子的声音在他耳边轻问： “…… 师弟？师弟你可听得见我说话？ ” 沈垣一个激灵，定了心神，强撑开上下打架的眼皮，眼前景象仿佛千花万叶飞旋，好一会 儿才重重叠叠合到了一处，渐渐清明起来。 他躺在一张床上。 往上看，是白纱曼曼，四角挂着精巧香囊的床顶。 往下看，自己一袭白衣，古香古色，一柄纸扇斜倚枕边。 往左看，一名身着玄端的俊雅青年坐于床侧，正关切地望过来； 沈垣闭上眼睛，蓦地伸手摸了那柄折扇，刷的展扇而开，簌簌摇动，扇去一头滚滚而下的 冷汗。 那青年目光中喜色闪动，温声问道： “ 师弟可算醒了，身体可还有不适的地方？ ” 沈垣矜持地道： “ 不妨事。 ” 信息量略有些大，他稀里糊涂想坐起身来。那青年见状，忙伸手扶他的背，让他靠在床 头。 终点的穿越重生文看多了，沈垣早下定决心，如果有朝一日一觉醒来发现躺的地方不对劲 ，在搞不清楚情况之前，绝对不要乐呵呵傻笑着说出 “ 这是在拍电视剧吗？道具好逼真， 你们剧组真给力！ ” 这种疑似弱智寻求安全感的话。他只管装作刚刚醒来、神情恍惚： “ 我 …… 这是在哪儿？ ” 那青年一愣，道： “ 你睡糊涂了？这里是你的清静峰啊。 ” 沈垣心里一惊，继续作欲晕状： “ 我 …… 为何会昏睡这么久？ ” 那青年道： “ 我还没问你呢。好端端的怎么发了一场高热？我知道，仙盟大会为期将近， 你教导徒儿，求成心切。可以如今我们苍穹山的根基和名望，纵使这次不遣一人参会，也 未必有人敢质疑，又何必在意那些虚名。 ” 沈垣越听越不对劲。这话怎么听起来那么耳熟？ 不对，这设定怎么听起来那么耳熟？ 接下来，那男子语重心长的一句，终于坐实了他的怀疑。 “ 清秋师弟，你在听师兄说话吗？ ” 这时， “ 叮 ” 的一声，梦境中那个谷歌翻译般机械的声音又响了起来。 【系统激活成功！绑定角色，洛冰河之师，苍穹山派清静峰峰主， ‘ 沈清秋 ’ 。武器，修雅 剑。原始 B 格： 100 。】 “ 靠靠靠你什么玩意儿？怎么像是直接在我脑子里说话？这样抄袭《狂傲仙魔途》的设定 向天打飞机他知道吗？！ ” 沈垣当然没说出来，可那个声音很快做出了回应。 【贵方触动系统执行指令，已与账号 ‘ 沈清秋 ’ 绑定。】 【随着剧情的展开，将有多项指数逐渐开启，请保证每一项指数不可低于 0 。否则系统将 自动给予惩罚。】 打住。够了。沈垣确定了。中奖了，他重生了！ 重生到一本自己刚读完还嫌弃过的暗黑系种马小说，而且自带一个什么鬼系统。作为新世 纪终点文学网一名 VIP 老读者，常年经历各路读档重来或夺舍重生 YY 文的洗礼，沈清秋 本来可以愉快地迅速接受这个事实的。但好死不死，他借的壳子是男主那位人渣反派师尊 沈清秋。这就 …… 呃，情况有点复杂了。 旁边这位看上去很好说话的仁兄，就是苍穹山派的现任掌门，沈清秋他师兄 “ 玄肃剑 ” 岳清 源。卧槽。 沈垣专门针对岳清源卧槽了一下，是有重大原因的  原作中，岳清源可是被他的好师弟 沈清秋害死的好吗！ 死的不要太惨啊。 万箭穿身尸骨无存！ 而此刻，这张被害人的脸正对着他这个 “ 凶手 ” 嘘寒问暖，压力好大。 不过现在看，剧情显然没有进展到那一步。岳清源还好端端的，说明这时沈清秋还没被扒 下伪君子的皮，也没身败名裂。 岳清源就是个老好人，没啥可怕的。虽然苦逼了点，但沈垣看书时还挺喜欢这个角色。他 稍稍放心的同时，一行文字诡异地浮上脑海。 【…… 黑黝黝的房间里，从房梁上垂下来一根铁索。铁索的末端吊着一个圆环。圆环扣着 一个人的腰。如果那还能算是 ‘ 人 ’ 的话。这个 ‘ 人 ’ 蓬头垢面，犹如疯子。最可怕的是，他 的四肢全都被切断了。肩膀和大腿，只有四个光秃秃的肉球。碰一碰，他就会发出喑哑的 ‘ 啊啊 ’ 声。他的舌头也被人生生拔去，所以说不出完整的词句。】 ↑ 《狂傲仙魔途》精选段落之沈清秋结局。 沈垣，啊不，沈清秋低头扶额。 他哪里还有那个资格感慨别人死得惨，死得最惨的就是他好么！ 万万不可铸成大错！ 要在错误发生之前就掐灭苗头 √ 从现在开始起狂抱男主大腿 √ 要做一个殷殷切切温柔教导的良师益友，对他嘘寒问暖无微不至 √ 刚冒出这个念头，沈清秋脑海里突兀地炸起一长串警报音，仿佛一百辆警车载着一百头神 兽尖鸣着呼啸而过，吵得他浑身一震，痛苦地捂住了脑袋。 岳清源担忧道： “ 师弟，你还头疼？ ” 沈清秋咬牙不答。系统尖锐地提醒：【警告。贵方刚才的意图十分危险。属于违规行为， 请不要尝试，否则系统会自动给予惩罚。】 “ 违规在哪里？ ” 【贵方现在处于初始等级， OOC 功能冻结。需要完成初级阶段任务之后才能够解冻。在 解冻之前，做出任何违反原 ‘ 沈清秋 ’ 角色设定的举动，都会扣掉一定的 B 格。】 作为一个半宅人士，沈清秋以前偶尔会看一些同人本子，你懂的，他当然知道 OOC 什么 意思。 的全文缩写，字面意思，指角色崩坏，不符合原作人物性格。 “…… 就是说，在那什么功能解冻之前，我的行为举止，都不能超出 ‘ 沈清秋 ’ 会做的范 畴？ ” 【正确理解。】 这都直接让他重生顶替沈清秋的壳子上了，还在乎什么 OOC 这种细节啊？ 沈清秋又问道： “ 你刚才说，什么什么 …… 指数不能低于 0, 如果低于 0 的话会怎么样？ ” 【贵方将被自动遣送回原来的世界。】 原来的世界？可是在原来的世界，沈垣的肉身已经死了啊。 也就是说，如果那什么 B 格被扣光，等待着他的，就是：死亡。 那我对男主不理不睬，不作为，总可以了吧？ 他抬起头来，扫了一圈，并没在侍奉一旁的弟子里看到符合洛冰河形象的人。他佯装漫不 经心道： “ 洛冰河在哪儿？ ” 岳清源顿了一顿，目光怪异地看着他。 沈清秋不动声色，却窃喜不已。难道时间不对头，男主还没拜师入苍穹山门下？ 岳清源说： “ 师弟你不要生气了。 ” 沈清秋心中油然而生一股不祥的预感。 岳清源叹道： “ 我知道你不喜欢他。可那孩子已经足够努力，也并没有犯什么大错，你就 别再则罚他了吧。 ” 沈清秋听得嘴唇发干，舔了舔，道： “…… 你直说吧，他在哪儿？ ” 岳清源默然片刻，说： “ 你吊着打完他之后，不是一向都关到柴房去的吗？ ” 沈清秋两眼一黑。","adopted mother even a single taste before she died. By complete coincidence, he was selected by one of the cultivation world’s four great sects, Cang Qiong Mountain Sect, and apprenticed under the “Xiu Ya sword” Shen Qingqiu. He’d thought that he could finally start down the proper path, but he hadn’t expected that Shen Qingqiu was fair without but foul within, trash of the lowest caliber. He was jealous of Luo Binghe’s unparalleled and exceptional talent, and secretly feared this disciple whose cultivation improved by leaps and bounds every day, always finding all sorts of ways to taunt and demean him, even enlisting fellow disciples to belittle him. Throughout the years of studying, he endured the humiliation; it was another heart-wrenching story filled with blood and tears. Under much difficulty, Luo Binghe managed to turn seventeen, when he finally encountered the ceremony the cultivation world held once every four yearsthe Immortal Alliance Conference. Here at the conference, Luo Binghe fell victim to Shen Qingqiu’s scheming, and fell into a crack in the boundary between the Demon and Human Realmsthe Endless Abyss. That’s right, only now did the story truly begin! Not only did Luo Binghe survive, within the Endless Abyss, he even found his personal sword, the peerless mystical “Xin Mo,” and there, learned about his origins. As it turned out, Luo Binghe had been born to the Demon Realm’s Saintly Ruler and a Human Realm woman; within his veins flowed both the blood of ancient, heaven-fallen demons, as well as that of the human race. His birth father, Tianlang-Jun, had been sealed beneath a great mountain, trapped for all eternity. His birth mother was a disciple from a righteous cultivation sect; that year, suspected of having secret ties to demons, she was expelled, and died from postpartum hemorrhage after giving birth to Luo Binghe. Prior to her death, she let her son off the lone ship she’d birthed him on, and only in this way, left Luo Binghe a chance of survival. Luo Binghe used Xin Mo to release his body’s seal on his demonic blood, and within the dark abyss, cultivated single-mindedly and enlightened himself on otherworldly techniques, before heading back to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. From here on, Luo Binghe steadily headed down the path of blackening, never looking back. Every single one of his old enemies suffered great torment and diedhorrible deaths by his hand. With his steadily improving acting and scheming skills, Luo Binghe won the trust of many people, feigning compliance while secretly plotting against them. He seized power and rose in position, beginning a reign of terror. As the story unfolded, Luo Binghe blackened further and further. He returned to the Demon Realm and inherited the position of Saintly Ruler, but still unsatisfied, began to massacre each one of the the human realm’s great righteous sects, bathing them in blood, eradicating all voices of opposition. In the end, Luo Binghe became a generation-spanning legend among immortals and demons, who talked about his unification of the three realms, the uncountable size of his harem, and his boundless number of descendants! “Dumb fuck author dumb fuck novel!” With his dying breath, Shen Yuan spat this final curse. Who could have imagined that an upstanding young man like him, who’d properly purchased VIP currency and read the official version, that what he’d persisted to finish even on his deathbed was a novel so stallion it left him speechless with rage, a money-swindling, overly-padded mess; how could he not curse? Proud Immortal Demon Way , author: Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky 7 . Just looking at this handle would assault you with a dirty feeling. Grade- school-level writing, with landmines everywhere 8 . Shen Yuan couldn’t even bear to call that incoherent mess of a setting the author created, a cultivation setting. Have you seen a cultivation world where people used horses and carriages all day? Have you seen a cultivation world where after achieving inedia, people still needed to eat and sleep? Have you seen a cultivation world where the author occasionally mixed up even the Foundation Establishment and Nascent Soul stages? Every single person, when in front of the protagonist, would act like his aura of “awesomeness” 9 had devoured their intelligence. Especially Luo Binghe’s master, that Shen Qingqiu, basically an idiot 10 among idiots, scum 11 among scum! His only purpose was to dig his own grave, and when he didn’t manage to finish, get killed by the protagonist. Then why did Shen Yuan read this book, and even read to the very end? Don’t misunderstand, Shen Yuan didn’t enjoy degrading himself. The reason was also what caused him the most frustration. This novel had an incredible amount of foreshadowing, plot lines everywhere, mystery after mystery, layer upon layer of red herrings. And at thevery endnot a single one paid off! It was enough to make him to puke a fountain of blood. Why were priceless herbs, spirit elixirs, and peerless beauties everywhere, like they didn’t cost a cent? Why were the villains’ speeches and poses as they dug their graves and got offed 12 all exactly the same? The many girls we barely caught a glance of, who’d agreed to enter the harem, what happened to them… alright let’s skip that for the momentThe many atrocities, who were the culprits? The giant list of characters hyped up as being awesome without equal, exactly what was their purpose; why was nothing of them shown, even at the very end? Towards-the-Sky-bro, Airplane-bro, “Great Master,” 13 can we have a discussion, fill! In! Plot holes! Okay! Shen Yuan felt like he could come back to life from sheer rage. In the endless darkness, a mechanical voice sounded by his ear. Activation code: “dumb fuck author dumb fuck novel.” System automatically triggered. “Who is this?” The tone was similar to Google Translate. Shen Yuan looked around: it seemed like he was floating in a virtual space, so dark he couldn’t see his hand before him, the voice coming from all directions. Welcome to the System. This System operates in line with the design concept ‘YOU CAN YOU UP, NO CAN NO BB’ 14 ; we hope to provide you with the best possible experience. It is our sincere wish that during your experience, you can fulfill your desire, and according to your wishes, transform a stupid work into a high-quality, magnificent, first-rate classic. We hope you enjoy. In the midst of the vertigo, a man’s voice asked lightly beside his ear, “Shidi? Shidi, can you hear me?” Shen Yuan shuddered and settled his mind, forcibly peeling open his eyes, the scene before him appearing as a massive, whirling flurry; it took a while for everything to finally coalesce, and slowly become clear. He lay on a bed. Looking up: a white, gauzy canopy, with finely-crafted perfume pouches hanging from the four corners. Looking down: he wore a white robe, its styling ancient. Next to the pillow lay a paper fan. Looking to his left: a handsome and elegant young man dressed inxuanduan 15 sat by his bedside, looking at him with concern. Shen Yuan closed his eyes, then sharply reached for that folding fan, opening it with a snap; he lightly waved it, fanning away the cold sweat pouring down his face. The man’s eyes lit up with joy, and he warmly asked, “Shidi finally woke up; is there any discomfort?” Shen Yuan reservedly said, “Nothing too bad.” The information overload was a bit much; he dazedly tried to sit up. Seeing this, the man quickly reached out to support his back, letting him lean against the headboard. Having read many of Zhongdian’s transmigration novels, Shen Yuan had long resolved that, if one day he woke up to find himself lying in a strange place, before he understood what was happening, he definitely wouldn’t giggle carefreely and say, “Are you filming a movie? The props look so real; your crew’s really giving their all!” the words of a person slow-wittedly trying to find their footing. He concentrated only on acting like he’d just woken up, expression absent-minded. “I… where is this?” The man startled and said, “Did you sleep yourself into a daze? This is your Qing Jing Peak.” Internally, Shen Yuan was shocked, but continued to act muddled. “Why… why was I asleep for so long?” The man said, “That’s what I wanted to ask you. You were in perfect health, how did you suddenly come down with a high fever? I know that with the Immortal Alliance Conference approaching, you’ve been training your disciples, and are anxious for results. But with Cang Qiong Mountain Sect’s foundations and renown today, even if someone didn’t attend this time, no one would dare question us; why concern yourself with those empty words.” The more Shen Yuan listened, the more something felt off. Why did these lines sound so familiar? No, why did this set-up sound so familiar? Next, a single earnest sentence from that man confirmed all his suspicions. “Qingqiu-shidi, are you listening to shixiong?” At this moment, something dinged, and the mechanical, Google-Translate- like voice from the dreamscape sounded again. The System was successfully activated! Role bound: Luo Binghe’s master, Cang Qiong Mountain Sect’s Qing Jing Peak Peak Lord, ‘Shen Qingqiu.’ Weapon: the sword Xiu Ya. Starting B-points 16 : one hundred.“Fuck fuck fuck what bullshit is this? How come you’re speaking directly into my brain? Does Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky know you’re plagiarizing Proud Immortal Demon Way ’s set-up like this?” Of course, Shen Yuan didn’t say this out loud, but that voice quickly responded. You have touched the System’s command execution, and have been bound to the account ‘Shen Qingqiu.’ As the plot progresses, many different types of points will gradually become available, please ensure that none of these points fall below 0. Otherwise the System will automatically dole out punishment. Stop. Enough. Shen Yuan was sure now. He’d hit the jackpot; he’d transmigrated! Transmigrated into something he’d just finished, and it was a pitch-black stallion novel he’d hated, even coming with some kind of shitty system. As a 21st century veteran VIP reader of Zhongdian Literature, he’d read through various types of do-over and transmigration male power fantasy novels year in and year out, so originally, Shen Yuan could have happily and easily accepted this fact. But of all people, the shell he borrowed just happened to be the male lead’s scum villain shizun Shen Qingqiu’s. This… uh, made the situation rather complicated. The good-natured-looking elder-brotherly type next to him was Cang Qiong Mountain Sect’s current Sect Leader, Shen Qingqiu’s shixiong, the “Xuan Su sword” Yue Qingyuan. Fuck. There was a very important reason Shen Yuan had specially gone “fuck” at Yue Qingyuanin the original work, Yue Qingyuan’s death had been caused by his good shidi Shen Qingqiu, okay! And what a horrific death it was. Tens of thousands of arrows had pierced him, until not even bones remained! And at this moment, this victim was facing his own “murderer,” showering him with concern; the pressure was immense. But looking again now, the story hadn’t unfolded to that point yet. Yue Qingyuan was still in perfect health, meaning at this time Shen Qingqiu had yet to reveal himself as a hypocrite, and his reputation was still not ruined. Yue Qingyuan was a bleeding heart 17 , nothing to be afraid of. Though this character ended up suffering quite a bit, during his read, Shen Yuan had been rather fond of him. He relaxed a little, when a string of words floated eerily to the forefront of his mind.Within the dark, gloomy room, a metal chain hung from a beam. At the end of the chain dangled a ring. The ring was fastened around a person’s waist. If that could still be considered a “person.” This “person’s” appearance was filthy and disheveled, like that of a madman. The most frightening thing was, all four of his limbs had been severed. His shoulders and thighs were only four bare knobs of flesh. When touched, he would let out a hoarse, “ahhh” sound. His tongue had been torn out too, rendering him unable to form complete words.  Proud Immortal Demon Way , a featured paragraph on Shen Qingqiu’s fate. Shen Yuan, ah no, Shen Qingqiu rested his forehead on his hand. He wasn’t in any position to lament how horrific other people’s deaths were; the most horrific death was his, okay! Must avoid any serious errors! Snuff out any sign of a mistake √ From now on, cling madly to the male lead’s thighs 18 √ Be a good teacher and helpful friend who is earnest and gentle in teaching; meticulously shower him with concern √ He’d just had these thoughts, when Shen Qingqiu’s mind suddenly erupted with a long string of alarms, as if one hundred police cars carrying one hundred shrieking divine beasts were zooming past, so cacophonous he shuddered, clutching his head in pain. Yue Qingyuan said worriedly, “Shidi, does your head still hurt?” Teeth clenched, Shen Qingqiu didn’t answer. The system shrilly alerted, Warning. Your plan just now was incredibly dangerous, and qualified as an act of violation; please do not attempt, or the system will automatically dole out punishment. “How was that a violation?” Currently, you are at the beginner rank, and the OOC feature is frozen. You will need to complete beginner-rank quests to unfreeze. Before unfreezing, doing anything that violates the original ‘Shen Qingqiu’ character’s settings will result in a fixed number of B-points being deducted. As a semi-otaku, Shen Qingqiu had occasionally seen several fanwork- related terms, you understand; of course he knew what OOC meant: the abbreviation for ‘out of character,’ defined as breaking character, acting in a way that was inconsistent with the original character’s personality. “In other words, before that whatever-feature gets unfrozen, my manner and actions can’t differ from what ‘Shen Qingqiu’ would do?”Correct. It’d already let him transmigrate into Shen Qingqiu’s shell, replacing him, but still cared about a detail like OOC? Shen Qingqiu asked again, “You just said, something like… that the points can’t fall below 0, if they do, what happens?” You will automatically be deported back to the original world. Original world? But in the original world, Shen Yuan’s body was already dead. In other words, if he lost all his B-or-whatever points, what awaited him was: death. Then if I just ignore the male lead and avoid doing anything, things should be fine, right? He raised his head and swept his gaze around, but didn’t see anyone that matched Luo Binghe’s appearance among the disciples waiting on him by his side. Acting unconcerned, he said, “Where is Luo Binghe?” Yue Qingyuan halted, and gave him a strange look. Shen Qingqiu remained straight-faced, but was secretly filled with glee. Could it be that time wasn’t ripe, and the male lead had yet to apprentice and enter Cang Qiong Mountain Sect? Yue Qingyuan said, “Shidi, don’t be angry.” An ominous premonition stirred in Shen Qingqiu’s heart. Yue Qingyuan sighed and said, “I know you don’t like him. But that child’s already worked hard enough, and he hasn’t made any large mistakes. Don’t punish him anymore, alright.” Hearing this, Shen Qingqiu’s lips went dry; he licked them and said, “Out with it, where is he?” Yue Qingyuan was silent for a moment, then said, “Whenever you finish stringing him up and beating him, haven’t you always shut him in the woodshed?” Shen Qingqiu’s vision went dark."
上辈子的沈垣家境殷实，多少算个小小富二代，上头有两个哥哥，将来肯定要继承家业的 ，下面有一个妹妹，是拿来疼爱的。一家人感情都很不错。 他早就知道，就算自己一辈子混吃等死，也不缺他那一口饭吃。也许因为从小成长环境宽 松舒适、缺乏竞争压力，他一向觉得，只要竞争总人数大于 10 ，十名以内都是好成绩。 因此，他从来不明白沈清秋这种人渣反派作死时究竟是怎样的心理。 原作的沈清秋其人，修为是有的，资历也是有的，装模做样的涵养，也是有的。地位名声 无一不缺，被天下第一大派养着不愁钱花，为啥就活得一点仙风道骨也没有，像旧社会深 宅大院里没事找事的幽怨姨太太，整天跟主角一介草根过不去，成天脑袋里盘算的尽是打 骂主角，以及吩咐别人打骂主角。 就算洛冰河他是天资过人，悟性绝佳，挂逼一个 …… 但也不至于嫉妒成这个样子啊？ 不过也不能怪他，要怪就怪作者。书中尿性类此的反派犹如过江之鲫，比比皆是，只不过 他算是格外着墨多、格外没品的一个。 能怎么办呢？这本书最大的 BOSS 就是主角他自己。萤火之光，怎敢与日月争辉？ 他被修真界尊为 “ 修雅剑 ” ，自然相貌气质不会算太差。 比方现在，沈清秋左看右看，就算是对着那面糊得跟稀饭似的黄铜镜，也还大致满意。 此人面貌端正，眉目乌黑，细梁薄唇，生得一派书卷之气。加之身修腿长，多少可算个美 男子。虽然真实年龄不祥，可这是本修真小说，沈清秋有金丹中期的修为，是以完美保持 着青年的外表。比他看书时脑补的好看不知多少倍。 虽然没法儿跟洛冰河比。 一想到洛冰河，沈清秋立刻脑仁儿疼得厉害。 他想去看看现在被关在柴房的洛冰河，可刚迈出一步，脑海里又响起那刺耳的警告提示 音。 【警告！ OOC 警告！ ‘ 沈清秋 ’ 不会主动探望洛冰河。】 沈清秋悻悻道： “ 好吧。那我派人叫他来总可以吧。 ” 他想了想，唤了一声： “ 明帆！ ” 门外立刻转进来一名约莫十六岁的少年，高高瘦瘦，应道： “ 徒儿在此。师傅有什么吩 咐？ ” 沈清秋不由得多看两眼，见他长得还算体面，就是有点儿尖嘴猴腮，心中啧啧慨叹：果然 是一脸炮灰相。 这，就是原作沈清秋的大弟子、洛冰河的师兄明帆。 这，就是传说中最低级的炮灰！ 不消说，什么深夜把洛冰河关在舍外、故意给错误的入门秘籍，这些事，都少不了他的参 与和谋划。沈清秋什么时候心血来潮想折腾洛冰河，最得力的助手和最积极的响应者也一 定是他。 鉴于此人原作中的结局比他好不了多少，沈清秋看这孩子的神情不由得就带上了几分同病 相怜： “ 去把冰河带过来。 ” 明帆心里直犯嘀咕：师父以往叫洛冰河，都是叫 “ 那小畜生 ” 、 “ 孽障 ” 、 “ 这厮 ” 、 “ 竖子 ” ， 连名字也没正经叫过几回，怎么忽然就叫得这么亲密。 可师父的指示，他自然不敢多问，立刻小跑到柴房，踢了门两脚： “ 出来！师尊叫你！ ” 沈清秋在房中踱步，脑内则研究系统研究得如火如荼。 【B 格，也就是装 B 的格调。 B 格越高，就代表越高端，大气上档次。】 那么，应该如何提升 B 格呢？ 【1 ，改变弱智剧情，提升反派与配角的智商； 2 ，避开雷点； 3 ，保证主角爽度； 4 ，补完 未被揭秘的剧情。】 沈清秋一一细细分析。 就是说，他不仅要给惹了一屁股仇家的原装货沈清秋收拾烂摊子，还要挽救别的角色不要 制造烂摊子； 他自己的老命都不知道保不保得住，却还要保证主角的挂和风头还有妹子不能少； 那些未解之谜的天坑作者非但没填，还得他自己扛个铲子吭哧吭哧地填平。 呵呵。 向天打飞机菊苣说了，《狂傲仙魔途》这本书的目标很明确，所写的每一个字，都是为了 一个目的，那就是爽。 尤其是黑化之后的挂逼男主装作无辜，扮猪吃老虎，反虐贱人的桥段，简直爽翻天。所以 它红得发紫，越写越长，比裹脚布还长。 沈清秋表示，单是要大概记清剧情这一项任务，他就压力很大了。雷点更是遍地都是，他 可不能保证都能避开！ 沈清秋： “ 什么样的剧情才叫不弱智？ ” 【没有具体标准，依读者主观感受而定。】 “ 那到底要积累到多少分值的时候，初级阶段任务才会发布？ ” 【依具体情况而定。达到要求时，会自动发布系统通知。】 具体问题具体分析可真是个万金油。沈清秋冷笑一声，听门扉声响，回头，就看见一个少 年慢慢走进门来。 虽然身形不稳，却依旧勉力站得笔直，恭声叫道： “ 师尊。 ” 沈清秋刚凝在嘴边的三分笑登时一僵。 要死啊！把这张今后将会迷倒上到八十老妪下至襁褓女婴、堪称玛丽苏性转的男主角脸打 成这样，妥妥的死定了！ 可是，就算是一张受尽折磨、伤痕累累的脸，主角，仍旧不愧是主角！ 洛冰河那双眼睛，依然明若晨星，好一个鲜嫩嫩的小帅哥胚子； 那坚毅而谦顺的神情，昭显了他高洁不屈的情操； 那笔直的腰杆和身形，是他宁折不弯的傲骨！ 刹那间，沈清秋心底泉涌而出大段大段的排比句，和各种修辞手法混杂着争先恐后生成无 数溢美之词，险些脱口而出！ 还好沈清秋悬崖勒马，心叫好险好险，这主角光环硬件太给力了，差点把持不住！ 眼看洛冰河一拐一瘸迈进门来，挣扎着想要下跪。沈清秋嘴角抽了抽，心说老夫可受不起 您这一拜，您今天拜我一下，指不定日后我膝盖骨就被你剜了，立刻阻止道： “ 不必了。 ” 他手一挥，掷出一只小瓶： “ 这是药。 ” 末了，又用讽刺的口气说道： “ 莫要让旁人看了， 还以为我清静峰虐待弟子。 ” 沈清秋进入角色非常之快，他大着胆子做出送药这一举动，却选择了比较恶劣的态度，还 算是符合沈清秋本人做坏事又怕被人发现的伪君子本色。 果然，系统没有发出 OOC 提示，沈清秋松了口气。 洛冰河本以为师尊叫他来是要接着继续 “ 教导 ” 他，万万没想到居然是赐药，先是一愣，随 后毕恭毕敬双手接过小瓶，诚心感谢道： “ 谢师尊赐药。 ” 洛冰河的脸这时尤见稚气，笑容真挚和煦，如同初升的暖阳。沈清秋盯着看了片刻，转过 脸去。 这男主前期未黑化的性格，绝对是根正苗红好少年，给点阳光就灿烂，你投他一分他回报 你十分的那种，说是小绵羊都不为过。 洛冰河又高兴地接道： “ 弟子日后定当加倍努力，不让师尊失望。 ” 呃，不是，你要是加倍努力了，估计你原来那个师尊才真的会失望 …… 若是沈清秋没看过《狂傲仙魔途》，此情此景，他必然会心酸不已，为洛冰河鞠一把同情 泪。 然而，他可是从头到尾上帝视角领教过了洛冰河黑化后丰富多彩的心理活动。据他总结， 洛冰河现在有多可怜，日后把脚踩在人家脑袋上时，就笑得有多狰狞肆意。面上温润如谦 谦君子，心里想的都是如何抽筋拔骨剥皮曝晒。 【洛冰河微笑道： “ 弟子以往所受之辱，今日特来百倍奉还。伤我手足者，我必断其四肢 ，挫骨扬灰。 ” 】 ↑ 《狂傲仙魔途》精选段落之二 后来他真的把沈清秋削成人棍了。 沈清秋坐入紫檀椅中，挑了一种并不过分亲近的语气，道： “ 冰河，入门心法练得如何？ ” 那一声 “ 冰河 ” 得他自己都一背鸡皮疙瘩。洛冰河也明显背脊抖了抖，不过，他还是露出 了一个略带羞涩的笑容： “ 弟子愚笨，仍是 …… 不得要领。 ” 那是。拿着一本假心法，不走火入魔都亏得他是皮糙肉厚的男主，能得要领才怪了。沈清 秋心内咆哮：少年你跟我混！让为师给你正确的心法啊！ 那如妖似魔的警报声狂响不止。沈清秋对系统道： “ 我就是想想。我当然知道这是违规！ ” 接着，他随意道： “ 为师今日则罚你，也是出于心急，毕竟时不我待。想来你入我门下已 不短，今年多大岁数了？ ” 洛冰河乖巧地道： “ 弟子虚岁十四。 ” 哦。十四啊。 也就是说，这个时候的沈清秋洛冰河师徒，已经经历了山门罚跪事件、清静峰同门群殴事 件、 “ 顶撞 ” 师尊被吊打事件、打破法器被罚苦力事件 …… 等等光荣往绩 [ 手动拜拜 ] 。 沈清秋扶额冲他摆了摆手： “…… 我想静静。 ”,"CHAPTER 2: ABUSED MALE LEAD In his previous life, Shen Yuan had been well-off growing up, and could qualify as a modestly wealthy second-gen 19 . He had two older brothers, set to inherit the family business, and a little sister he doted on. The entire family had been very close. From early on he’d known, that even if he idled the rest of his life away, he’d never want for food. Perhaps it was due to this carefree environment, devoid of competition and pressure, but he’d always believed that as long as a competition had more than ten participants, placing in the top ten was good enough. Therefore, he never understood what scum villains like Shen Qingqiu were thinking while digging their own graves. The original Shen Qingqiu, if it was about cultivation, he had that; qualifications, he had that as well; the self-restraint required to put on an act, he also had that. He lacked neither standing nor reputation, and with the world’s largest sect supporting him he’d never want for money, so why, when it came to the poise expected of an immortal, did he have none at all? Why act like one of those bitter, courtyard complex’s 20 concubines from the old days, the ones with too much time to spare, always picking on the protagonist who was as innocuous as a blade of grass, scheming day in and day out about how to torment him, and even getting others to do it for him. Even if Luo Binghe had god-given talent, even if his learning ability was exceptional, to the point it seemed cheap… there was still no need to envy him to this extent, ah? Still, the blame didn’t really lie with him, but with the author. These types of villains were everywhere in the novel, as numerous as carp in a river; it was just his character had been especially detailed, and especially rotten. What could you do? The ultimate BOSS in this book was the protagonist himself. How could a firefly outshine the sun and moon? The cultivation world had called him “Xiu Ya 21 sword,” so naturally he’d had the appearance and bearing to match. For instance, now, Shen Qingqiu turned his head left and right, finding even his muddied reflection in the bronze mirror quite satisfying. It was a face with good features: pitch-black eyes and brows, thin nose andlips, very much the air of a scholar. Combined with a slender body and long legs, he could at least be considered beautiful. Though his real age was unclear, this was a cultivation novel: Shen Qingqiu had achieved mid-Core Formation, which meant he’d perfectly preserved a youthful appearance. Certainly many times better-looking than what he’d head-canoned while reading. Though he still couldn’t compare to Luo Binghe. Thinking of Luo Binghe, Shen Qingqiu was immediately struck with a pounding headache. He wanted to go see the Luo Binghe who was currently shut in the woodshed, but as soon as he took a single step, that ear-piercing alert rang in his mind again. Warning! OOC Warning! “Shen Qingqiu” would not take the initiative to visit Luo Binghe. Shen Qingqiu angrily said, “Fine. Then I’ll get someone else to bring him; no problems then, right.” He thought for a moment, then called, “Ming Fan!” A youth around sixteen-years old, tall and thin, promptly ran in through the door, saying, “This disciple is here. What is Shifu’s command?” Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but send a couple more glances his way: he could be considered respectable-looking, just that his face was a bit unfortunate. Inside his heart, Shen Qingqiu tsked, lamenting: “As expected, a cannon fodder’s appearance.” This, was the original Shen Qingqiu’s most senior disciple, Luo Binghe’s shixiong Ming Fan. This, was the legendary, lowest-level cannon fodder! Needless to say, when it came to things like shutting Luo Binghe out of the dorms late at night, or purposely giving him false cultivation techniques, Ming Fan had a hand in all of them. Whenever Shen Qingqiu felt inclined to torment Luo Binghe, he was always his most useful assistant, his most enthusiastic supporter. Knowing this child’s fate in the original work wasn’t much better than his own, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help looking at him with the pitying gaze of a fellow victim. “Go bring Binghe here.” Internally, Ming Fan was unnerved: whenever their master had called for Luo Binghe, it was always “that little beast,” “ungrateful brat,” “this wretch,” “whelp;” 22 he’d hardly ever used his full name, so why the intimate address, all of a sudden. But this was their master’s command; Ming Fan didn’t dare question it,and immediately jogged to the woodshed, kicking the door twice. “Come out! Shizun’s calling you!” Shen Qingqiu paced inside the room, vigorously examining the System within his mind. B-points, also known as the points given for acting cool 23 . The higher the B-points, the higher the quality, the more magnificent, the better the rating. Then, how can I raise my B-points? One, change the nonsensical plot, and raise the villains’ and side cast’s IQs; two, avoid breaking the suspension of belief; three, ensure the protagonist’s gratification levels; four; discover and complete hidden plot points. Shen Qingqiu analyzed each one by one. That is to say, not only did he have to clean up the original Shen Qingqiu’s messes, the Shen Qingqiu who’d amassed a mountain of grudges, he also had to prevent other characters from creating more messes. He didn’t even know if he could preserve his own sorry life, yet he still needed to ensure that the protagonist’s OPness, spotlight, and number of girls weren’t reduced. All those unsolved mysteries, those plot holes the author not only hadn’t filled, now he had to grab a shovel and personally sweat away, filling them in himself. Ahhh. “Great Master” Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky had said, Proud Immortal Demon Way’s purpose was very clear; each word had been written with a single goal in mind, and that was to be gratifying. Especially the way the blackened, OP male lead would play innocent, a fake pig hunting tigers, exacting revenge schemes against lowlifes, all gratifying enough to overturn the heavens. So the work’s popularity had swelled red-hot, growing longer and longer, until no foot-binding cloth could compare in length. Shen Qingqiu thought, just keeping a decent track of the plot was already very stressful. Points that had broken the suspension of disbelief were everywhere, he couldn’t guarantee that he’d avoid all of them! Shen Qingqiu said, “What kind of plot would qualify as not nonsensical?” The standard is subjectively determined; it depends on the readers’ reactions. “Then how many points do I need to collect, to launch the introductory level quests?” The timing is situationally determined. When the requirements have beenmet, the System will automatically notify you. Subjectively determined, situationally determined, truly an all-purpose balm 24 . Shen Qingqiu scoffed a laugh, then hearing the door open, looked back and saw a youth slowly walk in. Even though his movements were unsteady, he still managed to stand perfectly straight, and respectfully called, “Shizun.” The small smile that had been forming at the corner of Shen Qingqiu’s mouth froze. He’d be killed! This was the face that would infatuate everyone in the future, from eighty-year-old women to swaddled infants, the Gary Stu protagonist’s face, and he’d beaten it to this extent; he’d definitely be killed! But, even though his face bore clear evidence of abuse, and was covered in injuries, the protagonist was, as expected, still the protagonist! Luo Binghe’s two eyes were as bright as morning stars; the tender beginnings of a handsome young man. That firm yet humble countenance, demonstrating his noble and unyielding attitude. That pencil-straight back and stance, a proud core that would rather break than bend! In that instant, a flood of parallelisms and stylistic devices surged in Shen Qingqiu’s heart, passage after passage jumbling together to form countless phrases of praise that almost spilled forth! Luckily, Shen Qingqiu managed to rein them in, internally yelling about how close it’d been; the hardware of this protagonist halo was really too excellent; he almost couldn’t hold back! He watched Luo Binghe limp through the door, then struggle to kneel. Shen Qingqiu’s mouth twitched, thinking, I can’t afford your respects; if you pay me your respects today, I might be kneecapped by you in the future, and immediately stopped him by saying, “No need.” He flicked his wrist, tossing over a small bottle. “This is medicine.” He stopped, then added in a mocking tone, “Don’t let outsiders see, and think my Qing Jing Peak abuses its disciples.” Shen Qingqiu had entered his role quickly: even though he’d done something incredibly daring like handing over medicine, he’d also chosen a nasty attitude, and could be considered to be in line with Shen Qingqiu’s trait of hypocrisy, to do evil things yet fear others knowing. Indeed, the System didn’t send an OOC alert; Shen Qingqiu let out a sighof relief. Luo Binghe had expected that his Shizun had called him to continue “teaching,” and could never have thought it’d be to give him medicine; at first he froze, then respectfully used both hands to receive the small bottle, saying with honest gratitude, “Thank you for the medicine, Shizun.” At this point in time, Luo Binghe’s face was still full of innocence, his smile sincere and gentle, like the warm dawning sun. Shen Qingqiu stared for a while, then turned his head away. This male lead’s personality pre-blackening, was that of a model and upright youth; shine a bit of sunlight on him and he’d glow, give him a scrap of goodwill and he’d return it tenfold, that type, to say he was a little sheep would not be excessive. Luo Binghe then happily continued, “This disciple will henceforth redouble his efforts, and not let Shizun be disappointed.” Eh, no, if you redouble your efforts, I’m guessing your original Shizun would then really be disappointed… If Shen Qingqiu had not read Proud Immortal Demon Way , upon seeing this scene, he would have found it heart-wrenching, and probably shed a couple of sympathetic tears at Luo Binghe’s plight. As it was, he’d seen everything from beginning to end as an omniscient reader, and been privy to Luo Binghe’s plentiful and colorful thoughts post- blackening. To summarize, Luo Binghe was pitiful now, but in the future he’d grind his heel into others’ faces, while laughing with reckless malevolence. Though he wore the mask of a kind and humble gentleman, inside all he thought about was how he’d rip out your tendons, pull out your bones, peel off your skin, then hang it all out to dry. Luo Binghe smiled and said, “The humiliation this disciple suffered in the past, today I’ll return it one hundred-fold. For hurting my hands and feet, I’ll tear off your limbs and grind them to dust.”  Proud Immortal Demon Way, featured paragraph number two Afterward, he’d really carved Shen Qingqiu into a human stick 25 . Shen Qingqiu moved to sit in a sandalwood chair, and picking an aloof tone, said, “Binghe, how’s your cultivation progress?” That single “Binghe” caused frightened goosebumps to rise all over his body. Luo Binghe also obviously shuddered, but he still gave a smile tinged with shyness. “This disciple is stupid, and still…failed to understand.” That was. An incorrect cultivation manual; that he hadn’t had a qideviation 26 was thanks to his incredible durability as the protagonist, to actually understand would be a miracle. Shen Qingqiu yelled within his heart: Boy, you come under me! This master will give you the correct methods! That demonic alert started blaring incessantly. Shen Qingqiu said to the System, “I was just thinking it. Of course I know that’s a violation!” Next, he casually said, “Today, this master punished you out of impatience; all in all, time waits for no one. Thinking about it, you’ve been under me for a while; how old are you this year?” Luo Binghe obediently said, “This disciple is fourteen.” Eh, fourteen, ah. That is to say, the Shen Qingqiu and Luo Binghe master-disciple pair, by this point, had already gone through the incident at the mountain entrance where he’d been forced to kneel as punishment, the Qing Jing Peak gang beating by his fellow disciples, the “talking back” Shizun incident where he’d been strung up and beaten, the instrument-breaking incident where he’d been punished with hard labour… such a glorious track record waves goodbye. Shen Qingqiu rested his forehead on one hand while waving him away with the other. “I wish to be alone.”"
沈清秋是一个很能随遇而安的人。 既然户口已经迁移到《狂傲仙魔途》里，而且原来的世界里的他已经翘辫子了，不如就在 这里得过且过着吧。 来到一个修真的世界，平白得了一身还算不赖的功法和剑术，又是出身名门正派。他想出 风头就能随时出风头，想缩头就能缩在苍穹山派清静峰上缩着头不问世事。有什么不好 的。 无非就是找妹子稍微有点困难。 这种 YY 种马小说，但凡一个妹子，长得不磕碜，必然是男主的囊中之物。大家都懂的。 不过沈清秋要求真的不高，在这边混吃等死，颐养天年，他就心满意足了。反正跟他前生 过的日子也没啥差别。 但是，只要有洛冰河在，他别说出风头了，只要他还留在这片原作者构造出的大陆上，就 算隐居到再世外桃源的地方，洛冰河称霸以后，也有本事把他揪出来削成人棍。 “ 我不是不想抱男主大腿，可是谁让这男主他妈的是暗黑系。有仇必报千倍奉还的类型 啊！ ” 日常地喷了一通向天打飞机菊苣后，沈清秋迅速定下了目标：总之，先熟悉环境，尽量多 跟系统打交道，勤恳提升业绩， B 格创收，尽快解冻 OOC 系统。如果见势不好，势必得另 寻出路。 苍穹十二峰，如同十二把天地锻造的巨剑，险峻雄奇，直冲云霄。 沈清秋的根据地清静峰不算最高，却是最清幽，绿浓荫雅，处处修竹。再加上沈清秋的弟 子基本上每个人都要学点琴棋书画之类的东西，时不时就能飘来朗朗书声，幽咽琴音，实 乃古代文艺青年的上佳去处，完美地符合原著沈清秋这个装 B 份子的需求。 路遇几个弟子恭恭敬敬地向沈清秋问好，他琢磨着原装货的那个劲儿，一脸高冷，微微颔 首，只管负手前行，倒也应付过去了，只在心里头疼今后该怎么把书中名字和这些晃来晃 去的人脸对上号。 不过这不是沈清秋要解决的当务之急。他要自保，首先就要把原装货那一身功力和剑法都 拾掇回来。 如果没记错，在洛冰河黑化之前，苍穹山派还会经历几次大的事变，什么魔族分子挑衅啦 仙盟大会啦，都少不得要他周旋。若他只穿了个壳子，没有修为傍身，不要说走剧情，用 不着主角出马，随便来个小妖小怪都能把他搞死！ 沈清秋独自步入林中深处，确认四周无人，才把腰悬的佩剑取下，左手握剑鞘，右手持剑 柄，缓缓拔出。 修雅剑是沈清秋年少成名时就佩在身边的，也算赫赫有名。剑光雪白清亮而不刺眼，绝对 的上上之品。往武器中灌入自身灵气，剑身就会微微发光。沈清秋正在想 “ 灌入灵气 ” 到底 是个怎么的操作方式，就见手中长剑白莹莹的闪了起来。 看来，原主的修为和武技也会一并继承。不需要刻意记忆，就自觉融会贯通了。沈清秋想 看看威力如何，随手一划。 谁知道这一划可吓死人，剑光炫目，仿佛瞬间一道闪电从他掌中释放，闪得他闭目保护钛 合金狗眼，再睁开时，就看见地面也跟雷劈了似的被砍出一条深沟。 “ 卧槽 …… ！！！ ” 沈清秋面无表情，心中却爽度爆表。 霸气侧漏！不愧为独占一峰的宗师级人物。有了这一身修为，他再勤修苦炼二十年，说不 定到日后万不得已、非要和挂逼洛冰河对峙之时，也能混个落荒而逃！ 是的。但求能落荒而逃就好！ 他还想再练练手，却听到一阵细微的踏碎枯枝的声音。 其实那声音离得很远，可他现在五感清敏，想不觉察都难。沈清秋看了看地上那道深沟， 把剑噌的收入鞘中，将身形隐入绿叶掩映的更深处。 那脚步声越来越近，来人不止一个。果然，片刻之后，首先出现的是洛冰河那张仿佛自带 柔光加高亮的脸，而率先响起来的却是一个清脆娇嫩的少女声音。 “ 阿洛阿洛，你看，这里地上好大一条沟！ ” 听到这个称呼，沈清秋躲在暗处，差点没脚底打个趔趄。 系统简介道：【沈清秋最小的女弟子，宁婴婴。】 沈清秋： “ 您这介绍有用吗？谁不知道，会这么叫洛冰河的不就那一个！ ” 跟在洛冰河身后的俏丽少女身影转了出来，看上去比洛冰河还要小一点儿，玉雪可爱，橙 色缎带扎着一束一束的辫子，一跑一跳，一派天真烂漫。正是标准的每本修真小说里都要 有的一个可爱小师妹形象。 而这个小师妹，让沈清秋有点情绪复杂。 这是因为他对宁婴婴图谋不轨。啊不，应该是原作的沈清秋对宁婴婴图谋不轨。 沈清秋设定是暗搓搓的伪君子。既然表面上清心寡欲洁身自爱，那么内心就一定要淫邪无 耻下流卑鄙。身为师长，却对乖巧活泼的小徒儿怀着龌龊的心思。三番两次意图下手，还 差点得手。 敢染指主角的女人，结果可想而知！ 沈清秋当初看书的时候还有点奇怪，洛冰河怎么没顺便把他给阉了？这完全不符合冰哥的 邪魅作风！于是他到读者评论区，跟着大部队刷了一栋 “ 求阉沈清秋！不阉弃文！ ” 的高 楼。如今忆来，细思恐极。当初要是呼吁成功了 …… 他现在就一定得剁了当初顶贴刷楼的 那只手！ 洛冰河看了一眼，只是可有可无地笑了笑。宁婴婴却想缠着他，没话找话： “ 阿洛，你说 ，是哪位师兄在此修炼剑芒呢？ ” 洛冰河倒提一柄斧头，开始砍一棵树，答道： “ 清静峰上有此修为的，恐怕只有师尊。 ” 他只说了一句，再没理她，自顾自手起斧落，老老实实砍树。 这些树并不细弱，斧头却半锈不锈的，这时的洛冰河毕竟只有十四岁，砍起来十分吃力， 不一会儿就出了一头汗。宁婴婴坐在一棵横地的老树干上，托腮看他，一会儿又无聊了， 撒娇道： “ 阿洛阿洛，你陪我玩嘛！ ” 洛冰河连汗都顾不上擦，继续抡斧头，道： “ 不行。师兄交待，今日的柴火砍完之后还要 去挑水。快些砍完，还能腾一些打坐时间。 ” 宁婴婴嘟嘴道： “ 师兄他们真不好！总是支使你干这干那的，我看就是故意欺负你。哼， 我回头跟师尊说去，保准让他们再也不敢这样。 ” 沈清秋本来当自己在狂傲仙魔途的真人版拍摄现场打酱油，欣赏青梅竹马两小无猜的情节 ，一听登时大惊失色。 不不不你可千万别来跟我说啊！我该怎么办啊！我不能 OOC 的，到底教训哪边才好啊！ 这时候的小洛冰河饱尝人间疾苦，却还有着一颗白莲花般的心。他对宁婴婴摇头道： “ 千 万不要。我不想让师尊为这些小事为难。师兄他们也并无恶意，只是看我年纪小，想多给 我一些历练机会。 ” 刹那间，沈清秋仿佛看到了他身后的万丈光芒，忍不住倒退三步  根本无法直视境界如 此之高、觉悟如此之深的男主！ 在宁婴婴的叽叽喳喳中，洛冰河砍到了足够数目的柴枝，把斧子放好，随便找了块还算干 净的地，盘足闭目开始打坐。 沈清秋心内长叹一声。 其实，主角的挂逼属性在前期的苦情戏部分里就有苗头了。明帆给他的修行入门心法是假 的。越是照着修习，应该越是狗屁不通。可洛冰河仗着自己绝世的天资和潜伏在体内的一 半魔族血统，硬是歪打正着，摸索出了自己的一套路子 …… 简直太不科学！ 唏嘘间，又是一阵杂乱的脚步声。 沈清秋一听就知道不好，要坏事了。 明帆带领几个低级的弟子转了出来，一见宁婴婴，喜气洋洋就要上来拉她的手： “ 小师 妹！小师妹我可找着你了。你怎么一声不响跑到这么个地方来。后山这么大，万一蹦出猛 兽毒蛇怎么办。师兄有好玩儿的东西给你看。 ” 他自然看到了默默打坐的洛冰河，直接当成空气无视掉了。洛冰河却很懂礼貌，睁眼叫了 一声师兄。 宁婴婴咯咯笑道： “ 我才不怕毒蛇猛兽呢。再说了这不有阿洛陪着我吗？ ” 明帆斜眼一扫洛冰河，哼了一声。,"CHAPTER 3: CANNON FODDER IN THE WAY Shen Qingqiu was an easygoing person. Since his residential address had already changed to Proud Immortal Demon Way , plus he’d already kicked the bucket in the original world, he might as well try getting by here. He’d arrived in a cultivation setting, received a body with decent martial ability and swordsmanship for free, and was also part of a famous righteous sect. If he wanted to stand out he could stand out; if he wanted to lie low he could hole himself up in Cang Qiong Mountain Sect’s Qing Jing Peak as a recluse. What was there to complain about. The only slightly difficult thing was finding a girlfriend. In this sort of male power fantasy stallion novel, any woman would inevitably belong to the male lead, as long as she wasn’t ugly. Everyone understood this. Still, Shen Qingqiu’s needs truly weren’t large, he’d be satisfied just idling away to a ripe old age. It wouldn’t be that different from his previous life anyway. However, as long as Luo Binghe was present, forget standing out, as long as he remained in the land of the original work’s setting, even if he secluded himself in some imaginary realm, after Luo Binghe took power, he’d still be able to carve Shen Qingqiu into a human stick. “It’s not that I don’t want to cling to the male lead’s thighs, but who made him so fucking black. The type who seeks thousand-fold retribution!” After his daily cursing at “Great Master” Airplane, Shen Qingqiu quickly set some goals: in short, familiarize himself with the environment, work with the System as much as possible, diligently increase his accomplishments, earn B- points, and unfreeze the OOC function as soon as possible. If the situation didn’t look good, he’d have to search for another path. Cang Qiong’s twelve peaks, were like twelve giant swords forged by nature, steep and magnificent, piercing the skies. Shen Qingqiu’s Qing Jing Peak wasn’t the tallest, but it was the most tranquil, heavily forested with tall bamboo. On top of that, as basically all of Shen Qingqiu’s disciples needed to learn the four arts 27 , from time to time would drift in the clear sounds of reading and the murmur of qin; it was an excellentdestination for youths of ancient arts and literature, and perfectly aligned with what the original Shen Qingqiu needed to act cool. Several disciples respectfully asked after Shen Qingqiu as they met in passing; he schooled his countenance into the original’s cold, aloof look, nodding slightly while walking with his hands clasped behind his back, and managed to get by, only troubled over how he was supposed to match the book’s names to these swaying faces. Although this wasn’t Shen Qingqiu’s most pressing concern. For self- defense, he first needed to figure out the original goods’ martial ability and swordsmanship. If he remembered correctly, before Luo Binghe blackened, Cang Qiong Mountains Sect would go through a couple of large incidents, things like demons provoking them or the Immortal Alliance Conference, and he had to deal with all of them. If all he had was a shell with no cultivation, forget following the plot, even without the male lead’s involvement, a small no-name monster could get him killed! Shen Qingqiu entered deep into the forest, alone. Only after confirming there were no people, did he remove the sword at his waist, holding the scabbard in his left hand and the hilt in his right, and slowly pulled it out. Xiu Ya had been with Shen Qingqiu since he was young and newly famous, and could be considered prestigious itself. The flash of its blade was snow-white, luminous but not blinding, definitely a top-class good. When one channeled spiritual energy into the weapon, the blade would glow faintly. Shen Qingqiu was pondering exactly how to “channel spiritual energy,” when the sword in his hand began to shimmer white. Seemed like he’d inherited the original’s cultivation and martial ability as well. His mind had filled everything in without him needing to consciously remember. Shen Qingqiu wanted to see its power, and casually slashed once. Who knew this single slash would be so terrifying: the sword’s arc dazzling, like a flash of lightning released from his palm, so bright he had to close his eyes 28 ; when he opened them again, he saw a deep ditch carved into the ground, as if split apart by lightning. “Holy fuck!” Shen Qingqiu remained expressionless, but his heart surged with gratification. Such awesomeness! Worthy of a character acting as a peak’s sole master. With this level of cultivation, if he diligently trained for twenty years, maybe asa last resort in the future, if he absolutely had to face that overpowered Luo Binghe, he might even be able to flee! Yes. All he wanted was to be able to flee! He still wanted to practice more, but then heard the subtle sound of footsteps snapping dry twigs. In truth, that sound was still a long way off, but his five senses were now sensitive, and it would be difficult to not notice. Shen Qingqiu examined that deep ditch in the ground, then sheathed his sword with a clang, hiding himself deeper into the greenery. Those footsteps came closer and closer; there was more than one person. As expected, a moment later, what first appeared was Luo Binghe’s face, seeming to shine with its own light, but the first sound was the crisp, delicate voice of a young maiden. “A-Luo, A-Luo, look, there’s a huge ditch in the ground here!” Hearing this address, Shen Qingqiu almost staggered in his hiding place. The System concisely said, Shen Qingqiu’s youngest female disciple, Ning Yingying. Shen Qingqiu: “What use was your introduction? Everyone knows that only one person addresses Luo Binghe this way!” The pretty girl following behind Luo Binghe came into view; she looked slightly younger than Luo Binghe, lovely and adorable, her braided hair bound with orange ribbons, running and skipping, full of naivety. Every proper cultivation novel must have an adorable little shimei type. This little shimei gave Shen Qingqiu some complicated feelings. This was because he had designs on Ning Yingying. Ah no, more like the original Shen Qingqiu had designs on Ning Yingying. Shen Qingqiu’s settings were that of a shady hypocrite. Since on the surface he looked pure-hearted, free of desire, and immune to evil temptations, then underneath he must be immoral, shameless, scummy, and despicable. He was a teacher, but had dirty intentions towards his obedient and lively disciple. He’d tried to carry them out several times, and had almost succeeded. To dare encroach on the male lead’s woman, one can imagine the result! Back then while reading, Shen Qingqiu had thought it a little strange, why didn’t Luo Binghe castrate him? This absolutely didn’t match with Bing-ge’s evil yet charming style! Therefore he’d gone to the readers’ comments section, and joined the mob in flooding it with posts of, “Please castrate Shen Qingqiu! No castration, we drop!” Upon reflection now, it was extremely terrifying whenhe thought about it closely. If the appeal had succeeded then, he’d absolutely have to chop off the hand he used to make those posts now! Luo Binghe glanced once, and only gave a half-hearted smile. But Ning Yingying wanted his attention, and fumbled around for something to say, “You say, A-Luo, which shixiong was practicing their sword flashes 29 here?” Luo Binghe picked up an axe, and started chopping at a tree, answering, “On Qing Jing Peak, I’m afraid only Shizun has this level of cultivation.” He only spoke one line, then paid her no more heed, minding only himself as he raised and lowered the axe, chopping trees in earnest. These trees were neither thin nor weak, yet the axe was half-rusted; at this time Luo Binghe was only fourteen years old, so chopping was extremely taxing on him; soon, sweat poured down his face. Ning Yingying sat on an old log, watching him with her face propped in her hands; after a while she was bored again and wheedled, “A-Luo, A-Luo, play with me!” Luo Binghe had no time to even wipe his sweat; he continued to swing the axe, saying, “I can’t. Our shixiongs told me that after I finish chopping today’s wood, I also have to carry water. If I finish chopping quickly, I can clear out some time to meditate.” Ning Yingying pouted and said, “Our shixiongs are really awful! Always making you do this and that; from what I see, they’re bullying you on purpose. Hmph, I’ll go back and tell Shizun; that’ll guarantee they’ll dare not do this anymore.” Before, Shen Qingqiu was treating this like he was at the scene of a Proud Immortal Demon Way shoot, just passing through 30 and enjoying a story between two childhood sweethearts; upon hearing this, he paled in shock. No no no you absolutely can’t come tell me! What am I supposed to do! I can’t be OOC, who exactly should I punish! At this time Luo Binghe was experiencing humanity’s hardships to the fullest, yet he still had the heart of a white lotus. He shook his head at Ning Yingying and said, “Absolutely don’t. I don’t want to trouble Shizun over these types of small matters. Our shixiongs also aren’t ill-intentioned, they just see that I’m young, and want to give me more chances to train.” In that instant, it was as if Shen Qingqiu saw behind him, ten thousands rays of light, and couldn’t help but back up three stepsunable to look directly at a male lead with such high state of being, such deep enlightenment! While Ning Yingying chattered, Luo Binghe finished chopping enough wood; putting the axe away, he randomly found a patch of relatively cleanground, and sat down cross-legged with his eyes closed. Inside his heart, Shen Qingqiu released a long sigh. In truth, the protagonist’s overpowered nature had already started emerging even during the early misery-filled storyline. The cultivation manual Ming Fan gave him was a fake. The more he trained following it, the more he should end up with absolute rubbish. But with his peerless talent and his body’s half-demon blood, Luo Binghe had managed to grope out a path of his own by complete accident… really too unscientific! While he was sighing, there came the sound of another set of jumbled footsteps. As soon as he heard, Shen Qingqiu knew it wouldn’t be good, that things were going to get bad. Ming Fan came out, leading several low-ranked disciples; upon seeing Ning Yingying, he delightedly came up to grab her hand. “Little shimei! Little shimei, I finally found you. How could you come to a place like this without saying anything. The back mountain area is so large, what if some dangerous beast or poisonous snake leapt out. Shixiong has something fun to show you.” He naturally saw Luo Binghe silently sitting, and ignored him as if he were air. But Luo Binghe being very well-mannered, opened his eyes and called out “Shixiong.” Ning Yingying said, giggling, “I’m not afraid of poisonous snakes or dangerous beasts. Besides, isn’t A-Luo with me?” Ming Fan swept his gaze over Luo Binghe, squinting, and hmphed."
他脑子里在想什么，沈清秋再清楚不过，肯定是听宁婴婴叫洛冰河叫得亲热，觉得这个讨 厌的师弟越发刺眼了。 宁婴婴毕竟小女孩儿心性，完全不懂看眼色看气氛，歪头问道： “ 师兄有什么好玩儿的？ 快拿出来给我看看。 ” 明帆又换上满面笑容，从腰间解下一枚碧青的玉佩，递到她面前： “ 师妹，这次我家来探 亲，给我带了不少成色好又有趣的小玩意儿。这个我看这特别漂亮，送给你！ ” 宁婴婴接了过来，对着从树叶间隙中射下阳光细细地看。明帆热切地问： “ 怎么样？你喜 欢不喜欢？ ” 偷窥到这里，沈清秋终于想起来了。这段剧情！ 不好，他不应该来这里的，危险啊！ 可这不能怪他记得不清楚。你让一个骂傻逼作者傻逼文的人，去记连载了四年、时间线横 跨两百年的小说最开头的古早内容？他可是看了二十天才看完的，入门那一段为虐而虐的 苦情戏码早忘光了好吗！ 宁婴婴根本看不出来什么成色好不好，胡乱看了一阵，把玉佩抛了回去。明帆的笑容僵在 脸上。宁婴婴皱了皱鼻子，随意地道： “ 什么呀，这个颜色难看死了，还不如阿洛的那个 好看呢。 ” 这回，不光明帆脸色不好，连一直很有自觉当自己不存在的洛冰河都身体轻微地一震，倏 地睁开眼睛。 明帆从牙缝里挤出几个字： “…… 师弟也佩这玩意儿呢？ ” 洛冰河略一迟疑，还没答话，宁婴婴便抢着道： “ 他当然有啦。成天贴心戴在脖子上，可 宝贝呢，连我要看看都不肯给。 ” 饶是洛冰河再镇定，这时也脸色一变，下意识握住了脖子上那枚藏在衣服里的观音坠子。 双商啊少女！男主真是无辜躺枪啊！ 宁婴婴说这话时根本没考虑到后果会如何，只是她一直见到洛冰河贴身佩戴着一枚玉观音 ，从来不离。对心上人的心上之物，女孩子总是会特别想弄到手，以此获得自己 “ 地位特 别” 的满足感，偏偏洛冰河就是不肯给，她不甘心，才在这当口上半是撒娇半是耍赖地提 起。 他当然不肯给好吗！！！那是洛冰河那位洗衣妇娘亲攒了大半辈子的钱，好不容易才给儿 子求的一枚开光宝器。那是在洛冰河黑暗世界陪伴他毕生的一点温暖，后期黑化最严重的 时候也能让他挽回一点残存的人性，哪会随随便便给人！ 明帆又气又妒，迈上前一步，厉声道： “ 洛师弟真是好大的架子，连宁婴婴师妹要看看你 的玉佩都不肯。这样下去，今后面对强敌，你是不是连施以援手都不肯啦！ ” 少年！你的前一句和后一句之间究竟有个毛线逻辑啊！ 宁婴婴也没想到会变成这样，急得跺脚： “ 他不愿意就算了。师兄你不要欺负他！ ” 洛冰河现在哪能斗得过明帆？又有一群给明帆当狗腿支使的下级弟子围堵，不一会儿那枚 玉观音就从他脖子上落到了明帆手中。他举起来看了一阵，忽然哈哈大笑。 宁婴婴奇怪道： “ 你 …… 你笑什么？ ” 明帆把那枚玉佩抛到宁婴婴手中，得意道： “ 我还以为是个什么稀世宝贝，才这么巴巴地 护着。师妹你猜怎么着？是个西贝货，哈哈哈哈 ……” 宁婴婴迷茫道： “ 西贝货？那是什么？ ” 洛冰河的拳头慢慢攥紧，眼底有暗流涌动，一字一句道： “ 还给我。 ” 沈清秋的手指也不由自主轻微地屈伸几下。 他自然也清楚那玉观音是假货，而且是洛冰河最高的怒气点之一。 当年的洗衣妇省吃俭用，却因见识短浅，被骗子骗得用高价买下了假货，伤心欲绝，之后 身体也每况愈下，无疑是洛冰河一生都解不开的痛。只有这一点，洛冰河从来不能忍！ 作为一个旁观者，沈清秋真的很想出手，暴揍一顿明帆，把玉佩抢回扔给洛冰河。 而且这样说不定，明帆就不会彻底得罪洛冰河，日后还能捡回一条小命。 系统：【 OOC 。】 沈清秋： “ 谢谢。闭嘴。 ” 明帆从宁婴婴手里又捻起那枚玉佩，状似嫌弃道： “ 还给你就还给你，指不定是在哪个地 摊上买来的便宜货，给师妹还怕弄脏了她的手呢。 ” 嘴上这么说着，却丝毫没有要还的意 思。 洛冰河脸部绷紧，突然双拳齐出，打在拉住他的几名低等弟子身上。 被激怒的时候，人的拳脚没有章法，只凭心中一股怒气乱打，一开始还唬住了那几个低等 弟子，然而他们很快就被发现这小子弱的一比，空有气势吓人而已，明帆再在上边招呼： “ 还愣着干什么？敢对师兄拳脚相向，教教他什么叫长幼尊卑！ ” 立刻都重拾勇气，围了上 去对着洛冰河痛殴。 宁婴婴惊呆了，她那可怜的脑容量依旧没捋清到底为啥会演变成现在的局面，大叫道： “ 师兄！你怎么能这样！你快叫他们停下来，要不然 …… 要不然我就再也不理你了！ ” 明帆一慌： “ 师妹，你别生气，我叫他们不打这小子就是了 ……” 话还没说完，一不留神， 洛冰河挣脱了那些七手八脚，猛扑上来，对着明帆的鼻子就是一拳。 “ 哎哟 ” 一声大叫，两道鲜血立刻从明帆鼻孔中流了出来。 宁婴婴本来眼泪汪汪的就快夺眶而出，这时一看，忍不住 “ 噗嗤！ ” 笑了出来。 沈清秋： …… 妹妹你到底是喜欢洛冰河还是要害他啊！ 原本明帆还能放过洛冰河的，可这下在心上人面前出了丑，是无论如何也不能就这么算了 的！ 两人扭打成一团，洛冰河再怎么天赋牛 B ，毕竟年纪小，又没修习过正百儿八经的典籍， 多半在单方面挨揍，却咬牙硬是一声也没叫，沈清秋下意识想出手。系统却爆出夺命追魂 般的警报声：【严重 OOC ！严重 OOC ！严重 OOC ！重要的事情说三遍！ ‘ 沈清秋 ’ 在此情况 下应选择面带微笑！袖手旁观！或者亲自动手！】 要他强势围观虐童也太没人性了 …… 沈清秋不能贸然冒这个风险，正焦急间，忽然有了个 折中的法子。 苍穹山派有一种小法术 “ 摘叶飞花 ” ，看似并没什么大用，只是好看有趣。原著曾描写洛冰 河用它轻轻松松获取了一位女 N 号的芳心，沈清秋这段日子狂补各类秘籍，也见到过这个 小法术的记载。 他随手摘了一枚叶子，灌入一点灵力，第一次灌得太多，叶片承受不住，顿时四分五裂， 第二次才成功，拈在指尖若有若无地一吹，松手，那枚叶片顿时像飞刀一般朝明帆直射了 出去！ 听到明帆长长一声惨叫，沈清秋甩了甩手，擦去额头一滴汗。 难怪都说若是高手一花一木皆可伤人。他这一下应该不至于把明帆就射死了吧 …… 洛冰河挨了好几拳好几脚，却忽然感觉明帆踉跄退开了，他抬头一看，额头有鲜血流过眼 睛，却不料明帆一伸手，也是一手掌的血。 明帆不可置信： “ 你敢用刀伤我？！ ” 宁婴婴刚才见他们打得凶不敢靠近，这时却忙 □□ 两人之间： “ 没有没有，阿洛才没有用 刀。不是他伤的！ ” 洛冰河也不知道怎么回事，紧抿着嘴，拭去脸上鲜血。明帆后背有鲜血透出，像是被剑锋 划过。他对着其他弟子质问： “ 你们刚才看清没有？他拿刀了没有？ ” 师弟们面面相觑，有的摇头，有的点头，乱七八糟。 明帆娇生惯养的小公子，从没受过这等皮肉之苦，看着自己满手的鲜血，心里一阵发慌。 可纳闷的是，无论地上还是洛冰河单薄的身上都没见到利器。总不至于不翼而飞吧。 沈清秋屏息。视线忽然阵阵发红，眼前弹出一行硕大的悬浮文字，触目惊心的血红色。 【违规： OOC 。 B 格－ 10 。目前 B 格： 90 。】 沈清秋一下子松了口气。他原先的估计是会扣除 50 左右，或者干脆扣光了，只扣了 10 ，不 要比他想的太好。现在扣扣今后还有机会把它再刷回来。可他这口气没送多久，明帆指着 洛冰河大叫道： “ 给我打！ ” 沈清秋险些一口老血当胸呕出。 数名弟子听从指挥扑了上去，沈清秋下意识一把扯了数片叶子，嗖嗖地全飞了出去。 刚出手他就后悔了。 我这是图啥啊？洛冰河好歹堂堂男主，以前被围殴这种事也不是没有过，还能被打死不 成？！ 要你操个屁的心？！ 刚才那一下还能蒙混过去，这下可真好，谁都不可能注意不到不对劲了！ 数名弟子人人挂了彩，不敢再围住洛冰河，惊疑不定围向了明帆。 “ 师兄！怎么回事啊？ ” “ 师兄我也好像被刀子割了一下！ ” 明帆脸色青青白白，半晌才扔出一句： “ 走！ ” 便带着一堆捂屁股、抱胳膊的跟班浩浩荡荡 地撤了。真是来也如风，去也如风。剩下宁婴婴呆呆地站了一会儿，喊道： “ 阿洛，刚才 是你把他们打跑的吗？ ” 洛冰河面色阴郁地摇了摇头。 他勉强站直身体，却又透出紧张的神色，低头弯腰，在地上查找着什么，落叶枯枝春泥都 被他翻来覆去了个遍。 沈清秋知道他在找什么，自然是那枚在混战中遗失的玉佩。 他看得清楚，明帆开打之前随手一甩胳膊，红绳挂到了他们头顶一只高高的树梢上，可他 又不能提点。而且，刚才那一把叶子飞出去后，他就听到了系统那令人心碎的声音：【违 规： OOC 。 B 格－ 10×6 。目前 B 格： 30 。】 瞬间跌破及格线！ 感情一片叶子算 10 分？不带这样简单粗暴地加减乘除啊！ 宁婴婴不敢说话。毕竟是她惹出这么一桩事来的。如果不是她多嘴，也不至于害洛冰河平 白丢了玉佩又挨了一顿打。当下也帮洛冰河寻找起来。 可是直到天色渐黑，他们当然也一无所获。 洛冰河呆呆地立在原地，看着满地狼藉。一大片土地都被他们翻遍了，可还是找不到。 宁婴婴见他失魂落魄的，心里有点害怕，拉住他的手： “ 阿洛，找不到就不要算了。对不 起，我以后赔你一个，好不好？ ” 洛冰河没有理她，慢慢把手抽回，低着头朝树林外走去。宁婴婴连忙跟上。 沈清秋也实在佩服自己。这两个小孩儿找了一下午，他居然也就这么看了一下午 …… 除了 闲的蛋疼，还有什么别的解释吗？ 等到他们走远之后，他才从隐匿之处转出来，抬头看了看，脚在地上一点，体会了一把什 么叫 “ 身轻如燕 ” ，轻而易举地把挂在树梢的那枚玉佩摘了下来。 沈清秋倒是想把它偷偷还给洛冰河，可他也熟悉这个系统的尿性了，这肯定也算违规行 为。他可没有多余的 B 格来挥霍了。 想了想，沈清秋打算且先收着。 也许今后这枚玉佩会大有用处。比如在千钧一发时拿出来作为交换性命的筹码？沈清秋认 真思考了下这个可能。 这时，一行立体感极强的绿色大字跃然眼前。 “ 恭喜！获得关键道具：假玉观音 ×1 。改变剧情， ‘ 沈清秋 ’ 智商＋ 100. 目前 B 格： 130 。请 再接再励！ ” 刚刚扣掉的分数，不但补回来，还涨了！ 而且这个玉观音，以它对洛冰河的影响，绝对是高级道具，保命用的！ 真是意外之喜！ 沈清秋通体一阵舒爽，在阴暗的地方蹲了一下午的郁闷也一扫而光，连系统那与谷歌翻译 如出一辙的欠抽声音也变得无比悦耳！ 而树林之外，已经走出后山的洛冰河慢慢松开拳头。 手心躺着几片完整的绿叶。叶片的边缘锋利，沾染着血迹。,"CHAPTER 4: SECRETLY ASSISTING THE MALE LEAD To Shen Qingqiu, it wasn’t clear what he was thinking, but he must have heard the affectionate way Ning Yingying addressed Luo Binghe, and felt that this annoying shidi had become even more irritating. In the end, Ning Yingying had a young girl’s disposition, completely unable to take a hint or read the atmosphere, and asked, head tilted, “What fun thing does Shixiong have? Hurry up and show it to me.” Ming Fan became all smiles, unfastened a deep green jade accessory from his waist, and held it in front of her: “Shimei, when my family came to visit this time, they brought me lots of high quality and interesting little things. I saw that this one was particularly pretty; I’ll give it to you!” Ning Yingying took it from him, and looked at it closely in the sunlight shining through the leaves. Ming Fan warmly asked, “Well? Do you like it?” Peeping from his place, Shen Qingqiu finally remembered. This scene! Not good, he shouldn’t have come here, danger! But he couldn’t be blamed for not remembering clearly. How could someone who’d cursed “dumbfuck author dumbfuck novel,” remember ancient content from the beginning of a novel that had serialized for four years, and covered a span of two hundred years? He’d spent twenty days reading the novel before finishing, and had long clean forgotten that misery-filled, abuse-for-the- sake-of-abuse story section from when he’d just started, okay! Ning Yingying had absolutely no idea what was high quality or not; after looking haphazardly at it for a while, she tossed the jade accessory back. Ming Fan’s smile froze. Ning Yingying wrinkled her nose, and said carelessly, “What, this color is so ugly, the one A-Luo has is prettier.” Now, not only did Ming Fan look unhappy, even Luo Binghe, who’d been wisely pretending to not exist, tremored lightly and quickly opened his eyes. Ming Fan spat a couple of words through gritted teeth, “Does shidi also wear this kind of thing?” Luo Binghe hesitated slightly, and hadn’t managed to answer, when Ning Yingying budged in first and said, “Of course he does. All day long he lovingly wears it around his neck; it’s his treasure; he refuses to even let me examine it.”No matter how composed Luo Binghe was, at this point his expression also changed, and he unconsciously clutched at the Guanyin 31 pendant around his neck, hidden beneath his clothes. Your IQ and EQ, young lady! The male lead is truly collateral damage! When she’d said these words, Ning Yingying completely hadn’t considered the consequences; only that she always saw Luo Binghe glued to and wearing a jade Guanyin, never parting with it. Girls especially invariably wanted to get their hands on the things their crushes treasured, which would give them the satisfaction of being in a “special position,” yet Luo Binghe simply refused to give; displeased, she’d brought it up in this half-sweet, half-brazen manner. Of course he refused, okay! Luo Binghe’s washerwoman mother spent the majority of her life’s earnings to finally, with great difficulty, give her son the protective charm 32 she wanted for him. In Luo Binghe’s dark world, it was the only bit of warmth in his life by his side, even at his blackest later, it could bring back his last dregs of humanity, how could he randomly hand it to others! Ming Fan was both angry and jealous, advancing forward a few steps, and harshly said, “Luo-shidi you sure are stuck-up, refusing to show Ning Yingying- shimei your accessory. If this keeps on, in the future when we face strong enemies, will you refuse to even lend a hand!” Young man! There’s definitely a logic gap between your first and second sentences! Ning Yingying hadn’t thought things would turn out like this, and anxiously stomped her feet. “It’s fine if he’s not willing. Shixiong, don’t bully him!” How could Luo Binghe outfight Ming Fan at this point? Plus there was a group of disciples being Ming Fan’s lackeys and ganging up on him; in a moment that jade Guanyin fell from his neck into Ming Fan’s hands. He raised it for a look, then suddenly laughed loudly. Ning Yingying said confusedly, “Why… why are you laughing?” Ming Fan tossed that jade accessory into Ning Yingying’s hands, and said gleefully, “I thought it had to be some rare treasure, for him to protect it so fiercely. Shimei, guess how it is? It’s xibei 33 goods, hahahaha…” Ning Yingying said, confused, “Xibei goods? What’s that?” Luo Binghe’s fists slowly clenched, an undercurrent surging in the depths of his eyes, and said word-by-word, “Give it back.” Shen Qingqiu’s fingers also involuntarily twitched several times. Naturally, he knew that jade Guanyin was a fake, and it was Luo Binghe’slargest berserk button. That year the washerwoman had skimped and saved on food and utilities, but because she lacked experience, a conman tricked her into paying a high price for a fake; heartbroken, her body steadily deteriorated afterwards; it was undoubtedly a pain Luo Binghe couldn’t remove his entire life. This was the one thing Luo Binghe could never tolerate! As a bystander, Shen Qingqiu really wanted to reach out, beat Ming Fan up, snatch the jade accessory back and toss it to Luo Binghe. Also, like this, maybe Ming Fan wouldn’t thoroughly offend Luo Binghe, and could keep his paltry life after. The System: OOC. Shen Qingqiu: “Thank you. Shut up.” Ming Fan plucked the accessory from Ning Yingying’s hands, and said in a disgusted manner, “You want it back, I’ll give it back, who knows which street stall this cheap good was purchased from; I’m afraid giving it to shimei would dirty her hands.” So he said, but without the slightest intention of returning it. Luo Binghe’s face was tight; he suddenly struck out with both fists, hitting the couple of low-ranked disciples restraining him. When enraged, one’s blows have no technique, only random strikes fueled by the anger within; at first he managed to cow that couple of low-ranked disciples, but they quickly figured out that this guy was incredibly weak, that only his manner was impressive; plus Ming Fan was calling from above, “What are you frozen for? He dared attack his shixiongs, teach him what it means to respect seniority!” They all regained their courage at once and surrounded Luo Binghe, clobbering him. Ning Yingying was scared stiff, her pitiful brain capacity still not understanding why things had progressed to this situation, and she yelled, “Shixiong! How could you do this! Hurry up and tell them to stop, or… or I’ll never talk to you ever again!” Ming Fan panicked. “Shimei, don’t be angry, I’ll tell them to stop hitting this guy, alright…” Before he finished speaking, as soon as he was distracted, Luo Binghe broke free from the many hands and legs and tackled him, sending a fist into Ming Fan’s nose. A yell of “aiyo,” and from Ming Fan’s nostrils immediately flowed two streams of fresh blood. Ning Yingying was initially about to burst into tears; when she saw this, she couldn’t help but let out a laugh of “puchi.”Shen Qingqiu: Sister, really, do you like Luo Binghe, or do you want to hurt him! Originally, Ming Fan could have let Luo Binghe go, but now that he’d been humiliated before his crush, he couldn’t let this be, no matter what! The two of them twisted into a heap, fighting, but no matter how awesome Luo Binghe’s talent, he was still young, and hadn’t cultivated using the proper manuals; for the most part he was one-sidedly being beaten, yet remained silent through clenched teeth; Shen Qingqiu subconsciously wanted to take action. But the System exploded with a terrifying alarm: Severe OOC! Severe OOC! Severe OOC! Important things must be said three times! In this situation, ‘Shen Qingqiu’ would choose to smile! Watch from the sidelines, hands in his sleeves! Or personally beat him himself! To make him stare on while a child’s being abused was really too inhuman… Shen Qingqiu couldn’t rashly take risks; in the middle of being anxious, he suddenly thought of a method of compromise. Cang Qiong Mountains Sect had a little technique, “Zai Ye Fei Hua 34 :” at a glance it wasn’t very useful, just aesthetic and interesting. The original described how Luo Binghe used it to easily win woman number N’s affections; these days Shen Qingqiu had been furiously reviewing various manuals, and had also seen the record for this little technique. He plucked a nearby leaf, and channeled a little spiritual power into it; the first time he channeled too much: the leaf couldn’t withstand it and immediately split into several pieces; he only succeeded the second time, held it between his fingertips and gently blew, letting go; that leaf immediately shot towards Ming Fan like an airborne knife! Hearing Ming Fan’s long and horrible scream, Shen Qingqiu flapped his hand, then wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead. No wonder it was said, if an expert, even a flower or tree could be used to hurt people. He shouldn’t have killed Ming Fan just now, right… Luo Binghe had suffered quite a few punches and kicks, yet suddenly felt Ming Fan stagger backwards; he looked up: fresh blood dripped from his forehead past his eyes, but he didn’t expect that when Ming Fan stretched out his hand, his palm was also covered in blood. Ming Fan was in disbelief. “You dare use a knife?” Just before, seeing how furious their fight was, Ning Yingying hadn’t dared come close, but now she hurried to place herself between the two. “No no, A-Luo didn’t use a knife. It wasn’t him!”Luo Binghe also didn’t know what had happened; he closed his mouth tightly, and tried to clean the blood from his face. Blood was seeping out on Ming Fan’s back, like he’d been cut with the edge of a sword. He interrogated the other disciples, “Did you see clearly? Was he holding a knife?” The disciples looked around at each other, some shaking their heads, some nodding, completely disordered. Ming Fan was a spoiled and pampered young master, and had never suffered this level of physical pain, seeing his own hand covered with blood, a surge of panic went through his heart. But the puzzling thing was, he saw no weapon on either the ground or Luo Binghe’s person. It couldn’t have vanished into thin air, right. Shen Qingqiu held his breath. His vision suddenly flashed red, and a line of huge floating text popped up before him, in an eye-catching and frightening blood-red. Violation: OOC. B-points -10. Current B-points: 90. Shen Qingqiu released a breath of relief. His original estimate was a deduction of around 50, or to perhaps be simply deducted everything; a deduction of 10 was much better than he’d thought. He’d been deducted now, but there would be chances in the future to earn them back. But shortly after he let out that breath, Ming Fan pointed to Luo Binghe and yelled, “Hit him!” Shen Qingqiu almost vomited a mouthful of blood, straight from his chest. Numerous disciples heard the order and tackled him; Shen Qingqiu involuntarily tore off a handful of leaves, and sent them all singing through the air. He regretted as soon as they left his hand. The fuck am I doing? No matter what, Luo Binghe was the magnificent male lead; it wasn’t as if he’d never been gang beaten before, like they could beat him to death? Like shit you need to worry? He could have still gotten away with the previous instance; but now, fantastic, anyone would notice something was off! Numerous disciples were splattered with blood, and no longer dared gang up on Luo Binghe, anxiously gathering around Ming Fan. “Shixiong! What’s going on!” “Shixiong, I also seem to have been cut by a knife!” Ming Fan’s face was green and white, only after a long moment did he throw out a, “Go!” Then leading a group of lackeys, covering their behinds and holding their arms, he vigorously withdrew. They truly came like the wind, andleft like the wind. Ning Yingying who remained stood there dumbly for a while, then shouted, “A-Luo, just now, were you the one who sent them running?” Luo Binghe shook his head, expression gloomy. He stood up, straightening with difficulty, but then bent down again with a tense look, searching the ground for something, turning over fallen leaves, dry twigs, and mud this way and that, multiple times. Shen Qingqiu knew what he was looking for: naturally it was that jade accessory, lost in the confusion. He saw it clearly, before fighting Ming Fan had swung out his arm, and with it the red string had snagged on a branch high above their heads, but he couldn’t point that out. Also, just now after he’d sent the leaves flying, he’d heard that heart-shattering System sound: Violation: OOC. B-points -10 x 6. Current B-points: 30. He’d fallen below passing grade in an instant! So one leaf equals 10 points? Don’t use such simple, crude arithmetic! Ning Yingying didn’t dare speak. After all, she caused this entire affair. If not for her big mouth, Luo Binghe would never have suffered a beating, on top of pointlessly losing his accessory. She immediately began to help Luo Binghe search. But they of course remained empty-handed, right until it became dark. Luo Binghe stood dumbly in place, staring at the mess of a ground. A large patch had been completely overturned by them, but still they could not find it. Seeing him dazed like he’d lost his soul, Ning Yingying was a little frightened, and grabbed his hand. “A-Luo, if we can’t find it, let’s just let it be. I’m sorry, I’ll buy you another one later, alright?” Luo Binghe paid her no heed: he slowly withdrew his hand, and walked towards the forest’s exterior, head lowered. Ning Yingying hurried to join him. Shen Qingqiu was truly impressed with himself. These two children had searched an entire afternoon, and he’d actually gone and watched the entire afternoon… what explanation was there, other than him having too much fucking time on his hands? He waited until they’d walked far, then finally emerged from his hiding place; he raised his head and looked, then tapped his foot off the ground, experiencing what it meant to have “a body as light as a swallow,” and with great ease, plucked that jade accessory from where it was caught on a branch. Shen Qingqiu actually wanted to secretly return it to Luo Binghe, but hewas familiar with this System’s nature; this would definitely count as a violation. He didn’t have extra B-points to squander. After thinking, Shen Qingqiu decided to keep it for now. Maybe afterwards, this jade accessory would be of great use. For example, perhaps during a critical moment, he could bargain it in exchange for his life? At this time, a line of green text with a strong 3D effect jumped into view. “Congratulations! Obtained key prop: fake jade Guanyin x1. For changing the storyline, ‘Shen Qingqiu’ IQ +100. Current B-points: 130. Please keep working hard!” The points that had just been deducted, were not only restored, they even increased! On top of that, this jade Guanyin, judging from its influence on Luo Binghe, was definitely a high-level prop, and could be used preserve his life! What a happy surprise! A burst of satisfaction rushed through Shen Qingqiu, clearing away even the gloom he’d gotten from crouching in the dark for a whole afternoon, to the point that even the System’s punchable, Google Translate-like voice became melodious beyond compare! And outside the forest, Luo Binghe, who’d already left the back mountain area, slowly unclenched his fist. Lying in his palm was a whole, green leaf. Its edges were sharp and stained with blood."
自从沈清秋从那场莫名其妙的高热里醒来后， “ 养病 ” 这些天，岳清源来看望过他好几次。 身为天下第一修仙大派的掌门、或说综合性修仙高等学府校长，事务不可说不繁重，却还 能对这个师弟如此上心，沈清秋人生地不熟，简直有感激涕零的冲动。 原装货对这样一位上司和同门，居然也能翻脸不认人，说撕就撕，可见有多人渣！ 岳清源端着他竹舍里奉上来的雪瓷茶盏，眼里满是殷殷关切： “ 师弟休养了这些日子，身 体可好些了？ ” 沈清秋折扇轻摇，融入在兄友弟恭的同门友爱气氛中： “ 清秋早已无事，有劳师兄挂心 了。 ” 岳清源： “ 那算来，师弟也差不多该下山了吧。有什么需要的吗？ ” 沈清秋摇扇的手一僵： “ 下山？ ” 岳清源奇道： “ 师弟病了一场，忘记了吗？不是你之前告诉我，双湖城那一桩事交由你来 处理，作为弟子们的一个历练机会？ ” 原来是原装货应承下来的麻烦事。可他目前还不能把这身灵力和武技适应到收发自如，哪 能带弟子下山历练。刚想厚着脸皮自打脸，翻悔说自己其实身体还是不适，系统冷酷的环 绕声响起： 【初级阶段任务发布。地点：双湖城。任务：完成历练。请点击接受。】 同时，眼前弹出悬浮的任务简介，下方两个选项，左边 “ 接受 ” ，右边 “ 拒绝 ” 。 原来这就是初级阶段任务。沈清秋的视线在 “ 接受 ” 上停留了一会儿，选项变成绿色， “ 叮 ” 的一声，系统提示：【任务接收成功，请详细阅读卷宗，做好准备。祝您马到成功。】 沈清秋回过神来，对岳清源笑道： “ 我自然记得，只是这些日子骨头养得懒了，险些忘了 这桩。不日我便动身。 ” 岳清源点头道： “ 若是还有不便，不必勉强。历练弟子不急于一时，除害的事其实你也不 必亲自为之。 ” 沈清秋含笑称是，却忍不住多看了岳清源两眼。 掌门师兄，你现在的角色定位，太像一个发布任务的 NPC 了 …… 清静峰的大小事务都是交给明帆这个心腹操劳的。沈清秋发现，这孩子凡是不牵涉到主角 时，就会效率和智商都奇高，第二天他们就能出发了。 离开清静峰之前，沈清秋检查了一下自己的形象。青衫，缓带，左腰悬剑，右手执扇，优 雅，斯文，可靠，飘逸！妥妥的世外高人！ 总而言之，绝对不会 OOC ，完美！ 长长的百级石阶下，山门之旁，就是给沈清秋备的马车，还有给数名随行弟子准备的马 匹。 沈清秋： “ 你逗我呢？好歹也是个修 □□ 观设定，出行为什么不御剑飞天？ ” 系统高冷地回答：【就算是哈利波特式的魔法世界观设定，也不是每个巫师出门都骑扫帚 的，太高调。】 沈清秋嘀咕： “ 你好懂。以前在哈利波特那边混过业务？ ” 系统打出了一行大大的【 …… 】悬空符号。 投入运行这么多年以来，有这个闲心跟系统扯蛋套近乎的人，沈清秋可能是第一个。 不过，沈清秋再想想，也对，此次下山是为历练，这些弟子多半年轻资历浅，还没找到属 于自己的佩剑。依照苍穹山派惯例，弟子们的修为到一个阶段时，才可以到十二峰中的万 剑峰挑一把合适的剑。 说是人挑剑，其实也是剑挑人，如果一个人根本没什么好天资，却非要拿一把集天地之灵 气凝结的上品好剑，无异于美女配丑汉，鲜花插牛粪。你想，人家剑还不乐意呢。 洛冰河的金手指，就是在他找到属于自己的那把奇剑 “ 心魔 ” 时开启的。 沈清秋进了马车。这马车外观不甚华丽，内里却宽敞舒坦的很，一只小小的香炉幽幽燃 着。坐定之后，沈清秋觉得刚才似乎有什么不对劲的地方，忽地折扇探出一挑，帘子挑起 ，他往外望去，顿时瞎了狗眼。 怪不得刚才觉得这个围着马车忙前忙后的身影熟悉呢，感情这个被众人呼来喝去使唤的打 杂的就是男主大大洛冰河！ 恰好洛冰河也把最后一样东西  沈清秋每次出行必备的（通常不会用到的）白玉棋盘搬 上马车。抬头见沈清秋神色复杂打量自己，微微一愣，恭敬地叫道： “ 师尊。 ” 他之前被沈清秋教训的伤好得差不多了，脸上淤青全消，总算能看清长啥样了。虽然年纪 尚小，五官尚显稚嫩，却挡不住眉目之间的清隽俊逸。再加上他行走动作间自有一股朗朗 之气，谁人能料这是在清静峰上被雨打风吹多年的惨淡花苞一朵。 虽是在做着搬运杂物的粗活，态度却一丝不苟，那专注认真的模样，让人看了很难不动 容。 尤其是沈清秋这种本来就对主角有几分好感的人。 他对于杀伐果断，恩怨分明的主角一向很有好感。定定看了一会儿，沈清秋 “ 唔 ” 了一声， 收回折扇，帘子放下。 不得不说，主角就是主角。怪道这小子虽然落魄，先期没背景没前途没爹疼娘爱的，却也 有那么多女一女二女三女四前赴后继投奔怀抱。长得好看才是硬道理！ 当然，这也解释了为什么总有各路炮灰看他不顺眼，要把他揍成猪头泄愤了。 他一转念，又想起一桩来：不对啊。出行弟子算上洛冰河一共十人的话，却只有九匹马， 还差一匹啊？ 好吧，用脚趾头想也知道会是谁在捣鬼。 果然，一阵窃笑中，明帆得意洋洋的声音从马车外远远传来： “ 实在是马匹紧缺，只好委 屈师弟你一回了。不过嘛，师弟根基差，刚好也趁此机会锻炼锻炼。 ” 马匹紧缺个屁，苍穹山派作为近些年修真混点抢业务第一大派，不说富得流油，还会差你 一匹马？！ 明帆却是深谙炮灰作死之道，顿了顿，又说： “ 怎么？你那是什么表情？不满吗？ ” 洛冰河不卑不亢，平稳地说： “ 不敢。 ” 这时，响起一阵少女银铃般的笑声，宁婴婴到了： “ 师兄，你们在说什么呀？ ” 沈清秋扶额。少女你来的真是时候！ 宁婴婴，就是明帆与洛冰河交恶的强力催化剂，但凡有她出场，洛冰河总少不了要有苦头 吃，明帆总少不了要作死。 沈清秋又矜持地挑起一点车帘，欲语还休，果见宁婴婴兴冲冲地招手： “ 阿洛，马不够 吗？你来和我共乘吧！ ” …… 真是给洛冰河拉得一手好仇恨。 须知这种落魄主角得到美人另眼相看的剧情，虽说是终点文一种常见的爽点套路，却也最 容易引人嫉妒打压。洛冰河这时如果接受了宁婴婴的提议，这一路就别想安宁了。 沈清秋看不下去了： “ 婴婴别胡闹，男女授受不亲，和师弟再亲也要有个限度。明帆，为 何磨蹭了这许久，还不出发？ ” 明帆大喜，心想师尊跟我果然是一条线上的！忙催动队伍出发。宁婴婴撅嘴不提。 小小闹剧暂且搁下，沈清秋收回心思，继续默读小案上摊开的卷宗。 此次出行，不仅仅是值得纪念的第一次下山走剧情，更是事关到能否解冻 OOC 功能的初 级阶段任务，不由他不认真对待。 卷宗内容，地点是离苍穹山派数十里之外的一座小城。近期城中出现了数桩凶案，已经接 连死了九人。 每名死者都有一个共同点，被细致地、完整地剥去了身上的皮肤。从头到脚，手法之精细 ，简直就像那身皮从来都不曾长在死者身上一般，令人发指。因此，凶手被称为 “ 剥皮 魔” 。 剥皮魔下手挑的都是年轻貌美的女子。所以双湖城中，但凡有女儿、娇妻、美妾的人家， 一到夜里都大门紧闭。饶是这样也挡不住剥皮魔来去自如。 接连惨死九人，官府却对此毫无办法，城中百姓人心惶惶，更有人风传是鬼魂作祟  不 然怎么来无影去无踪呢？！ 几名大户人家聚集起来，最终才决定请人上苍穹山派，向修仙奇人求助。 这些信息他之前已经看过很多遍。但是看再多遍也没有半点儿帮助。 剥皮魔是个什么玩意儿？！听都没听过！这特么是附加剧情还是隐藏剧情啊？！危险 不？！武力值高不？！哥能不能对付得了啊？！跟说好的不一样啊！ 他质问这些的时候，系统答道：【有什么不一样？之前贵方的身份是小说看客，小说是一 种艺术创作，艺术创作就会有所取舍，该略的略。而现在贵方已经成为这个世界的一份子 ，自然事无巨细都要亲身经历，被原作省略的剧情也要好好走完。】 沈清秋无奈，所以才勤修苦炼数日，只求早日收发自如，免得没死在男主脚下，却挂在一 些从没听过的妖魔鬼怪手里，出师未捷身先卒。 洛冰河还在外面，他一直不敢放松警惕，留神着动静。同时在车厢里到处乱翻。一切事物 应有尽有，沈清秋还翻出了五六套不同的茶具，一阵无语。上辈子他好歹也算个富二代， 也没这么穷讲究富贵病好吧。 这时，马车外传来一阵哄笑。他往外扫了一眼。 洛冰河一个人孤独地走在队伍最后，走一阵，跑一阵。时不时有马匹绕着他，故意激起一 阵尘土，弄得他灰头土脸。 沈清秋忍不住抓紧了扇柄，指关节隐隐发痒。 这只是一本书，所有的人都是构造出来的虚幻角色，理智上沈清秋很清楚这个事实 …… 可 是，当这个角色活生生地在他面前被这样嘲弄欺负时，要他毫不动容，也太不实际。 几次劝阻无果，宁婴婴总算明白了她的介入只会起到反作用，急忙策马靠近马车，对车里 叫道： “ 师尊！您看看师兄他们！ ” 沈清秋心下一动，却不表露出来，不咸不淡地道： “ 他们怎么了？ ” 她声音里带有浓浓的委屈意味，不依道： “ 他们这样欺负人，您也不说说他们。再这样下 去…… 师尊您教的徒弟，都成什么啦！ ” 这算是当面告状了，可明帆等人压根没压力。因为这些行为都是往日的沈清秋默许惯了的 ，他们只当欺负洛冰河欺负的越狠，师尊越高兴，哪里会有收敛？ 明帆最是高兴。那天在后山果然是洛冰河用不知道哪里学来的妖法在作祟。今天师尊在这 里，他就被镇住了！ 沈清秋 “ 哦 ” 了一声，说了一句： “ 洛冰河，你过来。 ” 洛冰河面色平淡，习以为常，应了声 “ 是 ” ，便走近前去。 众人先还幸灾乐祸，以为这是要把洛冰河逮近了提起耳朵教训。然而，下一刻，三观尽 碎！ 沈清秋折扇挑起了帘子，朝洛冰河高傲地抬了抬下巴，瞥向马车厢内。虽没说话，这个动 作的意味却再明显不过。 宁婴婴高兴道： “ 阿洛，快上车呀，师尊让你和他同乘呢！ ” 晴！天！霹！雳！ 要不是深知师尊得道多年，明帆等人都要怀疑沈清秋被邪魔附体了！ 洛冰河也是整个人愣住了。可他反应极快，没迟疑多久，便答道： “ 多谢师尊。 ” 登上了马 车，老老实实，正襟危坐在马车的角落。坐定后，手脚都规规矩矩，像是怕自己还打着补 丁的衣服把车厢弄脏了。 系统：【警告 …… 】 沈清秋： “ 拒绝警告。本人并未 OOC 。 ” 系统：【 “ 沈清秋 ” 不可能做出这种为洛冰河解困的举动。判定： OOC 等级 100% 。】 沈清秋道： “ 你有没有好好研究过这个角色复杂的内心世界？要是单纯是为了洛冰河解困 ，那当然不可能。可现在我的目的是为了不让宁婴婴对我这个师尊失望。婴婴可是我最疼 爱的小徒弟，她求我了，我怎么能让她白求？ ” 系统：【 …… 】 沈清秋： “ 所以我的行为，完全符合 ‘ 沈清秋 ’ 这个角色的逻辑。警告无效！ ” 通过这些天的交流，他已经渐渐摸清了一些门路。系统虽有规则，却并非死规则。既然规 则是活的，那就有讨价还价的余地。 果然，系统暂时没想到扣分说辞。沈清秋初战告捷爽翻天，不禁笑了出来。 他原本静坐在车厢内，闭眼打坐，似乎已经陷入冥想，这时忽然听他笑出声，洛冰河忍不 住偷瞄了一眼。 老实说，说洛冰河不惊讶，那是假的。虽说一直对沈清秋尊敬有加，但师尊待他如何、看 他如何，他一向心里还是有数的。 他先前以为叫自己上车，必然是有更厉害的在等着，也做好了心理准备，却没想到沈清秋 理都懒得理他，自顾自打坐起来。 洛冰河想了想，自己似乎从没这么近、这样仔细打量过沈清秋。 论皮相，沈清秋真是长得没话说。也许不算一等一的美男子，但就是好看，且耐看。半侧 颜的轮廓像是被溪中山泉打磨出来的，若不作横眉冷对之态，便温柔又明净。 沈清秋一睁眼，就见洛冰河在注视自己。日后男主角专属的那种 “ 目如两点寒星，露齿莞 尔，言笑晏晏 ” 的风采，此刻就可窥见一斑。 洛冰河被他逮个正着，正不知该如何是好，沈清秋已经对他笑了笑。 这一笑纯粹是下意识的。洛冰河却像被一根细微的小刺刺了一下，忙撤开目光，越发别扭 ，说不清是什么感受。 很快，沈清秋就笑不出来了。 系统提示：【违规： OOC 。 B 格－ 5 。目前 B 格： 165. 】 沈清秋： “…… 笑一下也要扣分啊？ ” 系统义正言辞：【。】,"CHAPTER 5: INTRODUCTORY LEVEL QUEST Ever since Shen Qingqiu awakened from that inexplicable fever, during the days he was “recuperating,” Yue Qingyuan came to visit him many times. As the world’s number one major cultivation sect’s Sect Leader, or it could be said, the principal of a comprehensive cultivation university, his workload must have been heavy, yet he could still be so considerate to this shidi; as a stranger in a strange place, Shen Qingqiu practically wanted to shed tears of gratitude. That the original goods could actually turn on such a superior and fellow disciple, breach their brotherly covenant just like that, it’s clear how much of a scum he was! Yue Qingyuan was carrying the Bamboo House’s porcelain tea bowl, eyes full of earnest concern. “Now that shidi’s rested for several days, has your health improved?” Lightly waving his folding fan, Shen Qingqiu was immersed in the atmosphere of brotherly love. “Qingqiu has long recovered; I’ve caused Shixiong trouble, making you worry.” Yue Qingyuan said, “Then I suppose it’s about time for shidi to leave the mountains. Is there anything you need?” The hand Shen Qingqiu was using to fan himself froze. “Leave the mountains?” Yue Qingyuan said, surprised, “Have you forgotten because of the illness? Didn’t you tell me before to leave the matter of Shuang Hu City to you, as a training opportunity for your disciples?” So it was something troublesome undertaken by the original goods. But while he’d been familiarizing himself with this body’s spiritual power and techniques, currently they still weren’t second nature; how could he take disciples down the mountains for training. Just as he was about to thicken his face and embarrass himself, to renege and say that his body wasn’t well after all, the System’s unfeeling voice reverberated: Introductory quest issued. Location: Shuang Hu City. Quest: Complete the training. Please click to accept. At the same time, the quest synopsis popped up before him, with two options on the bottom, the left “accept”, the right “reject.” So this was a introductory level quest. Shen Qingqiu’s gaze lingered on“accept” for a while; the option became green; a ding sounded, and the System alerted, Quest successfully accepted; please read the files thoroughly and make your preparations. We wish you a swift success. Shen Qingqiu came back to himself, and said to Yue Qingqiu while smiling, “I naturally remember; it’s just these days I’ve rested too much and became lazy, and almost forgot about this matter. I’ll head out in a few days.” Yue Qingyuan nodded and said, “If you’re not completely well, no need to force yourself. There’s no rush to train your disciples; you also don’t need to personally take care of the elimination.” Shen Qingqiu agreed while smiling, but could not help giving Yue Qingyuan two extra glances. Zhangmen-shixiong, your current role, is too much like a quest-giving NPC… All affairs at Qing Jing Peak, whether large or small, were handed to and looked after by the trusted subordinate Ming Fan. Shen Qingqiu discovered, that as long as the male lead wasn’t involved, this child was surprisingly efficient and intelligent; they were able to set out on the second day. Before leaving Qing Jing Peak, Shen Qingqiu briefly inspected his appearance. Teal robes, loose sash, sword at left hip, fan in right hand, elegant, cultured, reliable, graceful! A proper, otherworldly existence! In short, absolutely not OOC, perfect! At the bottom of the long, hundred-step stone stairway, by the mountain gates, was the carriage prepared for Shen Qingqiu, as well as numerous horses for the accompanying disciples. Shen Qingqiu: “Are you making fun of me? No matter what, this is still a cultivation setting; why aren’t we flying on swords?” The System cooly replied, Even if it’s a magical setting like Harry Potter, not every wizard goes out riding brooms; it’s too conspicuous. Shen Qingqiu muttered, “You’re sure knowledgeable. Did you do business over at Harry Potter’s before?” The System typed out a giant line of hovering symbols, … In all these years of operation, Shen Qingqiu might have been the first person bored enough to act so familiarly with the System, and fuck around with it. However, thinking about it more; it’s true; this trip down the mountains was for the sake of training; the majority of these disciples were young and lacked experience, and hadn’t found their personal swords yet. According toCang Qiong Mountains Sect’s conventions, only once a disciple’s cultivation reaches a certain stage, can they go to the Twelve Peaks’ Wan Jian Peak to pick out a suitable sword. Though it’s said that the person picks the sword, in truth the sword also picks the person; if a person without any decent talent insisted on taking a top- class sword capable of condensing collected spiritual energy from the heavens and earth, it would be tantamount to a beautiful woman marrying an ugly man, or arranging fresh flowers in cow dung. You can imagine, the sword wouldn’t even be willing. Luo Binghe’s golden finger only activated when he found his own personal sword, that mystical “Xin Mo.” Shen Qingqiu entered the carriage. This carriage’s appearance was very ornate, yet the interior was very spacious and comfortable; a small incense burner faintly smoldered. After sitting, Shen Qingqiu felt that just now, something didn’t seem quite right, and suddenly poked his fan out and raised it, lifting the curtains; he looked outside, and immediately felt like he’d been shocked blind at the sight. No wonder he’d thought that the silhouette hurrying back and forth around the carriage seemed familiar, turned out the person being ordered into doing miscellaneous tasks by everyone was none other than the great male lead Luo Binghe! Just then Luo Binghe also hauled the last item onto the carriagea white jade chess board that was mandatory on all of Shen Qingqiu’s trips (though usually not used). He raised his head to see Shen Qingqiu observing him with a complicated expression and slightly jolted, then respectfully called out, “Shizun.” The injuries he’d received from Shen Qingqiu’s discipline were about healed, the bruises on his face had vanished, and one could finally clearly see what he looked like. Even though he was young, his features still soft and immature, it could not conceal the delicate handsomeness within them. On top of that, there was a shining air around the way he walked and moved; who would be able to guess that this was Qing Jing Peak’s miserable flower bud that had been ravaged by winds and rains for many years. Although he was doing the rough work of moving miscellaneous items, his attitude was meticulous; it was hard to not be moved by that focused and earnest appearance of his. Especially Shen Qingqiu, who already had some fondness towards themale lead. He was very fond of how the male lead killed decisively, and of how extreme the binary was between his kindness and his hatred 35 . After looking fixedly for a while, Shen Qingqiu made an “oh” sound, then pulled back his fan, dropping the curtains. It had to be said, the male lead was simply the male lead. No wonder even though this kid was downtrodden, without background, prospects, or parents to love him, there were still so many women, one and two and three and four, hanging off, trailing behind, embracing, and throwing themselves at him. Good looks were the real way of the world! Of course, this explained why there were always cannon fodder who found him an eyesore, and wanted to vent by beating him until he looked like a pig’s head. Thinking again, he thought of something else: that’s not right. If the number of traveling disciples, including Luo Binghe, amounted to ten, but there were only nine horses, then they were still missing one? Alright, even if he thought with his toes he’d know who the troublemaker was. As expected, amidst snickering, Ming Fan’s gleeful voice came from outside the carriage: “Actually we’re short on horses, so we have no choice but to inconvenience shidi this time. Although, since shidi’s base is poor, it’s perfect, you can also take this chance to train.” Short on horses my ass; in recent years, of all the major sects, Cang Qiong Mountains Sect was number one when it came to cultivation and competing for business; that it was overflowing with wealth could be left unsaid, like they’d be short even a single horse? Ming Fan was truly well-versed in digging his own grave as cannon fodder; he paused, then added, “What? What sort of expression is that? You dissatisfied?” Neither haughty nor humble, Luo Binghe evenly said, “I wouldn’t dare.” At this point, a young girl’s bell-like laugh sounded: Ning Yingying had arrived. “Shixiong, what are you two talking about?” Shen Qingqiu held his forehead. Really, young lady, your arrival timing! Ning Yingying was a strong catalyst for Ming Fan’s and Luo Binghe’s ever-worsening relationship; whenever she appeared, Luo Binghe would always experience no shortage of suffering, and Ming Fan no shortage of personal grave digging.Once again, Shen Qingqiu reservedly lifted the carriage curtains a little, lost on whether he should speak; as expected he saw Ning Yingying excitedly waving her hand. “A-Luo, not enough horses? Come and ride with me!” She really does bring Luo Binghe a lot of hatred. It must be known that this type of plot, where the downtrodden protagonist received special attention from a beauty, although it was a gratifying trope often seen on Zhongdian Literature, was also the likeliest to incite others’ envy and persecution. At this time, if Luo Binghe accepted Ning Yingying’s suggestion, he could forget about getting any peace this trip. Shen Qingqiu could no longer bear to look. “Yingying, don’t make a fuss; men and women shouldn’t be too intimate; no matter how close you are with your shidi, there should be limits. Ming Fan, why have we tarried so long, and not set out yet?” Ming Fan was overjoyed, thinking, as expected, Shizun and I are on the same page! He hastily urged the group to depart. Ning Yingying pouted but said nothing. The little skit over for now, Shen Qingqiu detached his thoughts, and continued silently reading the files spread out on the desk. This trip, was not only to commemorate the first plot line that took him off the mountain, but more importantly concerned a introductory level quest that would determine whether or not he could unfreeze the OOC function; he couldn’t afford to not treat it seriously. From the file contents, the location was a small city several tens of li 36 away from Cang Qiong Mountains Sect. Recently within the city a number of murders had occurred; already nine people had been successively killed. Every victim shared a commonality: the skin on their body had been meticulously and completely peeled off. From head to toe, the technique precise, as if the skin had never been attached to the deceased’s body at all, enough to raise one’s hackles. Therefore, the murderer became known as the “skinner demon.” The skinner demon’s chosen victims were all young, beautiful women. Therefore in Shuang Hu City, every family with daughters, wives, and concubines, as soon as night came, would shut and lock their doors. Despite this, they could not stop the skinner demon from freely coming and going. Nine horrible deaths in succession, yet the officials were at a complete loss for what to do; the city’s people were in a state of panic; there were even rumors that it was the work of a ghostotherwise how could it disappearwithout a trace? Several influential families met together; at last they decided to ask someone to visit Cang Qiong Mountains Sect, and plead the immortal cultivators for assistance. He’d already read this information many times. But no matter how many times he read, it wasn’t the least bit helpful. The hell is a skinner demon? Never heard of it! Was this plot line added, or hidden? Is it dangerous? Is it strong? Am I able to deal with it, even? This isn’t what we agreed on! When he asked these, the System said, What isn’t? Previously you were a reader of novels; novels are a type of artistic creation; with artistic creations there are always decisions that have to be made, things that have to be left out. And now you have already become part of this world, naturally you have to personally experience everything, regardless of their importance; you must follow even the plotlines omitted in the original work to the very end. Shen Qingqiu had no say in anything; that’s why he’d diligently trained for numerous days, only seeking to make things second nature, lest instead of dying beneath the male lead’s feet, he croaked at the hands of some no-name monster, like a general passing away before his first victory. Luo Binghe was still outside, so the whole time he didn’t dare relax his vigil, keeping an eye out for activity. At the same time he rummaged through the carriage interior. Everything one could think of was here; Shen Qingqiu had managed to rummage out five or six different tea sets, and was speechless for a while. No matter what, in his past life he could have still counted as a wealthy second-gen, and he still hadn’t been this pointlessly indulgent 37 , okay. At this time, from outside the carriage came a wave of guffaws. He swept a glance outside. Alone, Luo Binghe walked at the back of the group, at times walking, at times running. From time to time horses would circle him, purposely kicking up a cloud of dust, until he was filthy and caked with it. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help clutching the handle of his fan, knuckles itching faintly. This was only a book; all the people were constructs, imaginary characters; logically Shen Qingqiu was very clear about this fact… but, when a character was actually being taunted and bullied before him like this, asking him to be completely unmoved, was still too unrealistic. Having dissuaded them several times to no avail, Ning Yingying finallyrealized her interference only made things worse, and anxiously urged her horse near the carriage, calling into the interior, “Shizun! The shixiongs, look at them!” Shen Qingqiu’s heart was a little moved, yet he didn’t show it, and placidly said, “What about them?” Her voice carried a strong tone of indignation, and she defiantly said, “They’re bullying someone like this, yet you’re not telling them off. If they keep on like this… Shizun, what are you teaching your disciples to become!” This was a direct tattling, but Ming Fan and the others felt no pressure at all. Because they were all used to Shen Qingqiu in the past silently permitting these actions; the harsher their bullying of Luo Binghe was, the happier Shizun was; why should they exercise restraint? Ming Fan was the happiest. As expected, that day in the back mountains area, Luo Binghe must have used some sorcery he learned from god-knows- where. Today Shizun was here, so he’d be crushed! Shen Qingqiu made an “oh” sound, then spoke one line: “Luo Binghe, you come here.” Luo Binghe’s expression was dull; accustomed to this, he gave a “yes”, then walked over. At first, everyone was still filled with schadenfreude, thinking that he was going to seize Luo Binghe for physical discipline. However, what happened next moment shattered all their world views! Shen Qingqiu used his fan to lift the curtains, then jerked his chin at Luo Binghe, before shooting a glance at the carriage interior. Even though he didn’t speak, the meaning couldn’t be clearer. Ning Yingying happily said, “A-Luo, hurry and get on, Shizun is letting you ride with him!” Like! Thunder! On! A! Clear! Day! If they hadn’t known so well Shizun for so many years, Ming Fan and the others would all suspect that Shen Qingqiu was possessed by a demon! Luo Binghe had also frozen in astonishment. But he reacted extremely quickly; after hesitating for a short while, he answered, “Many thanks to Shizun.” He stepped into the carriage, conscientious, and sat straight-backed in a corner. After sitting down, his hands and feet remained tucked-in, like he was afraid that his patched-up clothes, which he’d patched himself, would dirty the interior. The System: Warning…Shen Qingqiu: “Warning rejected. I wasn’t OOC.” The System: ‘Shen Qingqiu’ would never do anything to alleviate Luo Binghe’s troubles. Verdict: OOC level 100%. Shen Qingqiu said, “Have you carefully examined this character’s complicated state of mind? Of course he would never if it was purely to alleviate Luo Binghe’s troubles. But right now my goal is to not disappoint Ning Yingying as her Shizun. Ning Yingying is my dearest little disciple, and she pleaded with me, how can I let her plea be for nothing?” The System: … Shen Qingqiu: “So my actions are completely in line with ‘Shen Qingqiu’s’ character’s logic. Your warning is invalid!” With the exchanges from the last couple of days, he’d gradually figured out several working methods. The System had rules, but these rules were not rigid. Since that was the case, then it left leeway for bargaining. As expected, for the time being the System couldn’t think of an argument for deduction. Soaring with gratification, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help a laugh. Originally, he’d been quietly sitting in the carriage, meditating with this eyes closed, seemingly already in a trance; at this moment, Luo Binghe suddenly heard him laugh, and couldn’t help but secretly glance at him. To tell the truth, to say that Luo Binghe wasn’t surprised would be a lie. Even though he’d always revered Shen Qingqiu, he’d long understood well how Shizun treated and looked at him. Previously, he’d thought that if Shen Qingqiu asked him to get in, there must be something even more terrible waiting, and had mentally prepared himself; he didn’t expect for Shen Qingqiu to not bother with him at all, focusing on himself as he began to meditate. Luo Binghe thought for a moment; it seemed he had never been this close, had never carefully examined Shen Qingqiu like this before. Appearance-wise, you couldn’t complain about Shen Qingqiu. Perhaps he couldn’t qualify as supremely beautiful, but he was certainly good-looking, and one you wouldn’t tire of looking at. The profile of his face, in three-quarter view, seemed to have been carved by creeks and mountain springs, and when not in a cold scowl, became gentle and bright. As soon as Shen Qingqiu opened his eyes, he saw Luo Binghe staring at him. He could see a glimpse of the future Luo Binghe’s unique grace, that of “eyes like cold stars, a wide smile, quiet words and laughter.” Luo Binghe had been caught red-handed, and right as he was lost aboutwhat to do, Shen Qingqiu had already smiled at him. This smile was purely unconscious. But Luo Binghe felt like he’d been pricked by a small, fine thorn, and quickly averted his gaze, becoming increasingly awkward, unsure what he was feeling. Very soon, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t bring himself to smile anymore. The System alerted, Violation: OOC. B-points -5. Current B-points: 165. Shen Qingqiu: “Even smiling briefly gets a deduction?” The System righteously said, OOC is OOC."
吸取了教训，沈清秋接下来一路都板着脸，总算相安无事捱到了双湖城。 这座城虽不大，却还算繁华。入城之后在城中首富、也就是主持派人上苍穹山派求助的陈 老爷的宅邸中入住。 陈老爷的两房心爱小妾都惨死剥皮魔手下，对沈清秋的到来真是千盼万盼。他摸着第三房 貌美小妾白玉般的小手，对一行人长吁短叹、老泪纵横。 “ 仙人一定要为我们做主呀！我如今分毫不敢让蝶儿离开我的身边，生怕她也一不留神， 让那天杀的妖魔鬼怪害死！ ” 一股浓浓的 NPC 台词即视感让沈清秋脸皮抽搐。 他一点儿也不喜欢看六十岁的老头子和十几岁的小姑娘在面前卿卿我我！ 好在沈清秋还有个高人的光环，草草见过了之后，很高冷地就进房间去了，只留下明帆和 陈老爷寒暄。高人就是有特权，各种高冷旁人还不敢说什么。越高冷越是有敬仰的目光环 绕身旁。 宁婴婴敲门进来，甜甜地问： “ 师尊，婴婴要出去集市上转一转。师尊要不要来陪我嘛！ ” 说真的，没有男人不喜欢萝莉甜兮兮的对自己撒娇。沈清秋原本背对着她，被叫得心都酥 了一半，转过另一半，摆出一个执卷回眸、清冷无欲的完美知识分子形象，淡淡地道： “ 婴婴若是想出去转转，找及各位师兄师弟陪你即可。对付那剥皮魔之前，为师还有事情 要做。 ” 她会找谁陪，沈清秋还不清楚么？ 他难道不想出去玩儿？之前闷在清静峰的竹舍里，日日装逼格高的文艺师尊，干什么都 “ 淡淡地 ” ，淡淡地说，淡淡地笑，淡淡地练剑，淡淡地装 B 淡得他时常有往自己头上 撒一把盐的冲动，蛋疼！好不容易下一趟山，还要被系统以 “ 初始设定沈清秋喜静，不愿 到人多之地凑热闹 ” 为由困在房间里。他连打坐都不想装了，躺在床上干脆装死。日落之 前，明帆进房来向他汇报。 总算有个人来陪他说说话了。沈清秋忍不住老泪纵横。福利都是男主的，寂寞都是炮灰 的。陪萝莉逛街看花灯是没他们份儿的。 明帆道： “ 弟子仔细查看过尸体。 ” 他面色严肃地呈上手中事物。 沈清秋定睛细看，那是两叠用朱砂写就的黄符纸，纸面已经变成腐烂般的黑色： “ 这些符 纸，你拿去试探尸身的魔气了？ ” 明帆道： “ 师尊慧眼如炬。这些符纸弟子用在了两处。一处是业已下葬的女子坟墓旁的的 泥土，一处是仵作那里尚未入土的尸身。 ” 连坟墓旁的泥土都被魔气浸染成这样，这下可以确认，那剥皮魔的身份无疑是魔了。总算 是知道自己要对付的是什么。 沈清秋清了清嗓子，让紧接着的一声 “ 哼 ” 听起来更冷酷： “ 胆敢在苍穹山地界百里之内残 害山下百姓性命，既然这些魔界宵小自己撞上门来，也怨不得我派弟子替天行道了。 ” 相信他，他真的一点都不想说这种应付场面的烂俗台词。可是不说会 > 明帆满眼崇拜： “ 师尊英明！若师尊出手，必能将那魔物一击拿下，为民除害！ ” “……” 看来这对师徒，以前都是 “ 你主宰我崇拜 ” 模式，合作的相当愉快嘛。 说真的，从沈清秋的角度来讲，明帆这个徒弟他太满意了。虽然是富家少爷，骄纵惯了， 可那骄纵劲儿半点也不敢在师父面前显摆，反而惟命是从，毕恭毕敬。男人总不会嫌弃旁 人对自己敬若神明的。出门远行路上的打点、食宿安排也是明帆一手包办。如果不是遇到 主角时会因不可抗力而双商下跌、化身无恶不作的校霸，也是个有为青年的苗子！ 而且对于这个最后被洛冰河扔到虫坑万蚁噬身而死的炮灰徒弟，沈清秋总有种同病相怜的 感觉 …… “ 此次下山，是为历练。不到万不得已，为师不会出手相助。明帆你身为大弟子，须得谨 慎安排，莫要让那魔物伤到了同门。 ” “ 是！弟子已经设下阵法，只要那魔物 ……” 明帆还没说完，一人直闯进门来，打断了他。洛冰河脸色苍白地叫道： “ 师尊！ ” 沈清秋心里咯噔一声，面上却仍故作冷淡： “ 何事大呼小叫，如此惊慌。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 宁婴婴师姐同弟子白天出门去城中集市，傍晚时分，我催促师姐回来，她不 肯，不知怎么的转眼就不见了人影。弟子 …… 找了一遍整条街，找不到，只得回来求助师 尊。 ” 在这紧要档口失踪，那可不是闹着玩儿的。天都快黑了！明帆当场跳将起来： “ 洛冰河！ 你……” 沈清秋连忙一挥袖子，书案上的茶盏爆开，不但起到了威慑作用而没有 OOC ，又及时阻 止了明帆作死。 他装出强忍怒气的模样： “ 事已至此，多说无益。洛冰河，你跟我来。明帆，你带上几名 师弟，请陈员外相助，一起搜寻你师妹去。 ” 明帆恨恨应了，急匆匆出去。洛冰河低着头，一语不发。 沈清秋知道，这绝对不是他的错，因为宁婴婴不仅是娇俏可爱的女角色担当，也是作死拖 后腿的女角色担当，原作中因为她忽然失踪或者关键时刻捅娄子掉链子而生出的波折，少 说也给向天打飞机拖了一百章的剧情。有时候沈清秋也挺佩服洛冰河的，收后宫的气势气 吞山河，来者不拒，这么能惹麻烦的都敢收，而且还没被坑死，只能说主角果然酷炫狂霸 炸天。此等绝色一般人可消受不起。 洛冰河本以为沈清秋留他下来是要打骂一番，低声道： “ 这件事都是弟子的错，师尊要责 罚，弟子无怨无悔，只求平安寻回宁师姐。 ” 沈清秋看他怪可怜的，想摸摸头，却碍于系统存在，强行忍住，冷冷地道： “ 你过来。带 我去你和你师姐走失的地方。 ” 洛冰河和宁婴婴是在集市最繁华的一带失散的。 沈清秋闭上眼睛，一丝魔气若有若无。顺着那股像是随时会断裂般的魔气一路走下去，再 张开眼睛时，沈清秋发现他站在一家胭脂铺门口。 沈清秋： “……” 难道凶手是胭脂铺的人？这么简单？ 然而进入胭脂铺之后，魔气又断了气，彻底消散了。 或者凶手并非藏匿在胭脂铺，只是近期来过一次？进胭脂铺 …… 剥皮魔是女人？ 沈清秋瞎猜一阵，打法洛冰河进去问了几个问题，无果。 这种为了给他刷等级单独开出的任务，没有原作剧情可以参考。沈清秋又自认不是思维缜 密举衣反三的推理高手，从前玩儿个密室逃脱或破案追凶都能把自己活活困死，正烦恼间 ，系统贴心地给予提示：【觉察贵方进度遇到困难，是否付出 100B 格值，开启简单模 式？】 沈清秋： “ 靠，有简单模式这玩意儿你不早说！开开开！ ” 他的目光定格在 “ 是 ” 的选项上三秒，选项变成绿色后消失了。然后，某种气息让他鸡皮疙 瘩爬了一背。 好、好浓烈的魔气！ 简直就像怕别人找不到目标一样！ 简单模式，诚不欺我也！ 沈清秋一点也不以简单模式为耻，兴高采烈地顺着魔气蔓延方向走去。五百步之后，渐渐 偏离城中区域，来到一座废弃的荒宅前。 没跑了就是这里！你看那惨白的纸灯笼，你看那破败的大门！妥妥的鬼屋有木有！ 沈清秋调整表情，叮嘱沉默一路尾随他的洛冰河： “ 你回陈府，通知明帆，带上所有法宝 和师兄弟，一同前来。 ” 洛冰河还没开口应答，忽地瞳孔骤缩。 沈清秋见他直直盯着自己身后，便知不好。然而，终究是迟了，一阵阴风袭过，大门砰地 打开。 “ 师尊，师尊，快醒醒！ ” 沈清秋就醒了。 醒来之后，就见洛冰河神色焦灼，被五花大绑在对面，见沈清秋醒来，似是松了一口，眼 睛都亮起来了，又叫了声师尊。 而宁婴婴就跟他绑在一起，也跟着哭丧着脸叫： “ 师尊。 ” 沈清秋有点晕晕乎乎的，也不知道那魔物喷的鬼东西有没有后遗症。 他心情很不好。 这个简单模式真的是简单粗暴啊！直接就把他送到小 BOSS 口里来了！ 最糟糕的是，堂堂清静峰主人居然在徒弟们面前被一只小 BOSS 击倒了，于是他刚一醒来 ，系统就刺耳地提示：【 OOC ， B 格 50 。】 刚才为了开启简单模式付出了 100B 格，转眼又扣掉 50B 格，说不心疼那怎么可能。本来， 依沈清秋的原装实力对付魔物，那是杀鸡用牛刀；可耻的是，牛刀还没把鸡杀掉。 但是很快，他发现了一件让他心情更不好的事。 他觉得身上有点不对劲，凉凉的，而且有细微疼痛感。低头一看，一句 “ 卧槽 ” 险些把持不 住脱口而出。 他！被！扒！光！了！,"CHAPTER 6: UNFAVORABLE BEGINNING Having learned his lesson, afterwards Shen Qingqiu spent the rest of the trip stone-faced, until he finally arrived at Shuang Hu City without incident. Although this city wasn’t large, it could still be considered to be bustling. After entering, they stayed at the mansion of the city’s richest man, also the one who’d facilitated sending someone to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect to plead for assistance, Old Master Chen. Two of Old Master Chen’s beloved concubines had died horribly at the skinner demon’s hands, so he’d been desperately looking forward to Shen Qingqiu’s arrival. He rubbed his beautiful third concubine’s small, white jade- like hands, while moaning and groaning to a row of people, overflowing with tears. “Immortal masters, you must help us! Nowadays I dare not let Die-er leave my side for a second, for fear that the moment she’s careless, she’d be killed by that wretched monster!” A strong sense of deja vu at these NPC-like lines caused Shen Qingqiu’s face to twitch. He absolutely didn’t enjoy seeing a sixty-year-old old coot and a young girl in her teens, coo at each other before him! Luckily Shen Qingqiu still had the aura of a lofty great; after half- heartedly meeting with them, he aloofly went to his room, leaving only Ming Fan to make small talk with Old Master Chen. Being one of the greats simply had privileges, no matter how aloof you were others wouldn’t dare say anything. The more aloof, the more respectful gazes surrounded you. Ning Yingying knocked and entered, sweetly asking, “Shizun, Yingying wants to go and walk around the market. Would Shizun like to keep me company!” Speaking truthfully, no man would dislike having a young girl sweetly cajole you. Shen Qingqiu originally had his back facing her; upon hearing this half his heart melted; he cleared the other half, glancing back with the air of one passing out exams, the appearance of a cold and detached intellectual, and said blandly, “If Yingying wants to go and walk around, you may ask several shixiongs or shidis to accompany you. Before confronting the skinner demon, this master still has things to do.” Who she’d ask to keep her company, could Shen Qingqiu not know?Could he not want to go out and play? Previously, he’d been shut inside Qing Jing Peak’s Bamboo House, pretending daily to be an awesome Shizun of the literature and arts; everything he did had to be done “blandly:” blandly saying, blandly laughing, blandly practicing the sword, blandly acting cool bland to the point he often had the urge to scatter a handful of salt over his head; fucking annoying! And when he finally got a break with a trip off the mountains, he was still trapped in his room due to the System’s reason of “the original Shen Qingqiu liked quiet, and would not be willing to mix in places with large amounts of people.” He didn’t even want to pretend to meditate, and lay on the bed just pretending to be dead. Before sunset, Ming Fan entered the room to report. Finally someone came to talk to him, keep him company. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but want to overflow with tears. All benefits belonged to the male lead, all loneliness to the cannon fodder. Accompanying young girls to view colored lanterns, none of that was for them. Ming Fan said, “This disciple has closely examined the corpse.” With a solemn expression, he presented the items in his hand. Shen Qingqiu took a closer look; they were two stacks of yellow talismans, written with cinnabar; the paper had already become a black color akin to necrosis. “You used these talismans to test for demonic energy?” Ming Fan said, “Shizun’s eyes see all 38 . This disciple used these talismans in two places. One at the soil near the grave of a woman who’d been buried, the other at a yet-to-be-buried corpse at the coroner’s.” With even the soil by the grave so saturated with demonic energy, this confirmed that the skinner demon was undoubtedly from the demon race. Finally he knew what they were confronting. Shen Qingqiu cleared his throat, making the “hmph” he made right after sound even colder. “To dare harm the lives of the people within a hundred li of Cang Qiong Mountain, since these demonic lowlifes came to our doors themselves, they can’t blame me sending disciples to mete justice in heaven’s place.” Believe him, he really didn’t want to say this kind of corny, hot-air-filled line. But he’d be OOC if he didn’t! Ming Fan’s eyes were full of worship. “Shizun is wise! If Shizun took action, that demon would be taken care of in one strike, ridding the people of evil!” “…”Looks like this master-disciple pair, since the past had always followed the mold of “you’re the ruler, I’m the worshipper,” a very joyous cooperation. To tell the truth, from Shen Qingqiu’s point of view, he was extremely satisfied with Ming Fan as a disciple. Even though he was a rich young master, and spoiled rotten, he didn’t dare show even a little of that arrogance before his master, and instead was absolutely obedient, incredibly respectful. A man would never dislike being worshipped by others like a god. The travel preparations, the food and lodging arrangements, all of it had been single-handedly done by Ming Fan. If his IQ didn’t inevitably plummet whenever he met the protagonist, transforming into a schoolyard bully capable of any misdeed, he would also be a promising young sprout! And towards this cannon fodder disciple who in the end, was thrown into an ant pit by Luo Binghe and bitten to death by tens of thousands of ants, as a fellow victim, Shen Qingqiu always felt a kind of pity… “This trip off the mountain was for the sake of training. Unless as a last resort, this master will not assist you. Ming Fan, as the most senior disciple, you must make careful arrangements, lest you let that demon harm your fellow disciples.” “Yes! This disciple has already devised a tactical formation, as long as that demon…” Ming Fan had yet to finish, when a person rushed into the room, interrupting him. Luo Binghe’s face was stark-white as he yelled, “Shizun!” Shen Qingqiu’s heart thumped once, but he feigned an indifferent expression. “What happened, for you to shout so loudly, and in such a panic.” Luo Binghe said, “Ning Yingying-shijie went with this disciple to the city’s market earlier in the day; when it became evening, I urged shijie to return, but she refused, then somehow she suddenly vanished. This disciple… searched the entire street once, but couldn’t find her, and could only come back to plead Shizun for help.” To disappear at this critical moment; this was certainly no joke. Night had almost fallen! Ming Fan leapt up right away. “Luo Binghe! You…” Shen Qingqiu promptly flicked his sleeves, and the tea bowl on the desk exploded; not only did it work as a deterrent, it also prevented Ming Fan from digging his grave. He put on an appearance of barely suppressed anger. “Since the matter’s already become like this, saying more is pointless. Luo Binghe, you come with me. Ming Fan, take a couple of shidis and ask Landlord Chen for assistance, andgo look for your shimei together.” Ming Fan gave a hateful look but responded, and hurriedly left. Luo Binghe had his head lowered, not saying a single word. Shen Qingqiu knew, this absolutely wasn’t his fault, because Ning Yingying’s role as a female character wasn’t only to be lovable and cute, but also to dig her own grave and be a burden; in the original work the number of twists caused by her sudden disappearances, blunders, or messes, was enough for Airplane-Shooting-Towards-the-Sky to drag out the plot by more than a hundred chapters. Sometimes Shen Qingqiu was rather impressed with Luo Binghe’s dauntlessness when accepting harem members, never refusing anyone, daring to accept even the most troublesome of women, and to do this without being screwed over and killed; he could only say that as expected, the protagonist’s brilliance was truly magnificent 39 . A normal person definitely couldn’t withstand such a thing. Luo Binghe originally thought Shen Qingqiu must have made him stay so he could beat and yell at him, and lowly said, “This entire affair was this disciple’s fault; if Shizun wishes to punish, this disciple will neither resent nor regret, and only wishes for Ning-shijie’s safe return.” Shen Qingqiu thought he looked incredibly pitiful and wanted to pat his head, but as he was obstructed by the System’s existence, forcibly held himself back and coldly said, “You come here. Take me to the place where your shijie vanished.” Luo Binghe and Ning Yingying had lost each other in the market’s most bustling area. Shen Qingqiu closed his eyes; there was a barely tangible thread of demonic energy. He followed that bit of demonic energy, which seemed like it would fray or snap at any moment; by the time he opened his eyes, Shen Qingqiu found that he was standing at the doors of a rouge shop. Shen Qingqiu: “…” Could it be, that the murderer was someone from the rouge shop? Was it that easy? However, after entering the rouge shop, the thread of demonic energy snapped, dissipating completely. Perhaps the murderer wasn’t hiding in the rouge shop; it was just that they’d come once, recently? Entering a rouge shop… the skinner demon was a woman? Shen Qingqiu blindly guessed for a while, sent Luo Binghe inside to ask afew questions, but with no results. This sort of quest had been exclusively released for him so he could gain ranks, and so had no scenes in the original work that he could use as references. Shen Qingqiu also acknowledged that he wasn’t a master of deduction who could think meticulously, who could infer many things from a single clue; previously when playing room escape or detective games he’d always dead- ended himself; right as he was agonizing, the System thoughtfully prompted, We notice that you have encountered difficulties; would you like to spend 100 B- points and activate Easy Mode? Shen Qingqiu: “Shit, there was something like an easy mode, say that earlier! Activate activate activate!” He fixed his gaze on the “yes” option for three seconds; the option became green then disappeared. Then, something in the air caused goosebumps to erupt all over his back. Such, such thick demonic energy! As if they were afraid people couldn’t find the target! Calling it Easy Mode was no lie! Shen Qingqiu wasn’t the least bit ashamed about using Easy Mode, and with soaring spirits, walked in the direction the demonic energy was sprawling. After five hundred steps, they gradually left the central district, and arrived before an abandoned, neglected house. It can only be here! Look at those ghastly-white paper lanterns, look at those dilapidated gates! A proper haunted house, don’t you see! Shen Qingqiu adjusted his expression, and urged Luo Binghe, who’d been silently following behind him, “Return to Chen Manor and notify Ming Fan, to bring all the disciples and talismans and come here.” Luo Binghe had yet to utter a response, when his pupils suddenly contracted. Shen Qingqiu saw that he was staring straight at something behind him, and knew that things weren’t good. However, it was too late after all, and a gust of ill wind blew past, the gates slamming open. “Shizun, Shizun, wake up, quickly!” Shen Qingqiu woke up. After waking, he saw Luo Binghe with a distressed expression, trussed up opposite him; when he saw Shen Qingqiu awaken, he seemed to heave a sigh of relief, eyes brightening, and called “Shizun” again. And Ning Yingying was tied together with him, also calling with amiserable expression, “Shizun.” Shen Qingqiu was a little dizzy, and also had no idea if whatever crap the demon sprayed had residual effects. He was in a foul mood. This Easy Mode really was straightforwardly 40 merciless! It’d delivered him straight into the BOSS’s mouth! The worst part was, the dignified Qing Jing Peak Peak Lord had been unexpectedly struck down by a small BOSS, and so a short while after he woke up, the System shrilly prompted, OOC, B-points -50. He’d just spent 100 B-points to activate easy mode, now in a flash he’d been deducted another 50, how could he not be distressed. Originally, with the original Shen Qingqiu’s skill at facing demons, it should have been like killing a chicken with a knife; shamefully, the knife had failed to kill the chicken. But very soon, he discovered something that made his mood worse. His body seemed a little strange; it felt chilly, and there was a slight pain. Upon lowering his head, he almost couldn’t stop a “fuck” from leaving his mouth. He’d been stripped naked!"
虽然只是上身扒光，但也够惊悚了。 沈清秋好歹是一峰之主！这个上身赤果果、只穿了条裤子和白靴、被细细的麻绳紧紧绑住 四肢倒在地上的形象是闹！哪！样！活像是被捉奸在床细皮嫩肉的小白脸，难怪系统一扣 就是 50 ，该！扣光也是活该！ 沈清秋脸上红一阵白一阵。想用剑在地上刨个坑把自己埋一会儿，可他的佩剑也不翼而 飞。 怪不得洛冰河刚才好像有点尴尬又忧心忡忡。他肯定在想，看到了沈清秋这么狼狈的样子 ，回去少不得又要被狠狠打击报复了。 宁婴婴呜呜地道： “ 师尊你可算醒了，婴婴好害怕 ……” 害怕？害怕你就别乱跑啊少女！沈清秋无奈。 这时，身后传来一阵桀桀怪笑。一条黑色的人影从黑暗中浮现。 “ 什么苍穹山，什么清静峰主人，也不过如此。自诩天下第一大派的苍穹山若都是这样的 角色，魔族征服人界指日可待。 ” 说罢又是一阵狂笑。 对方头脸都罩着黑纱，声音粗哑难听，就像被鸦片熏坏了嗓子。 沈清秋眯了眯眼， “ 剥皮魔？ ” “ 不错！我就是我，我就是剥皮魔！赫赫有名的修雅剑今日栽在我手里，痛快！沈清秋啊 沈清秋，你猜破脑袋也猜不出，我到底是谁吧！ ” 沈清秋道： “ 这有什么猜不出的。 ” 剥皮魔： “……” 沈清秋： “ 你是蝶儿嘛。 ” 剥皮魔： “……” 它一把掀开黑纱，暴躁道： “ 不可能！你怎么猜到的！ ” 沈清秋无语。 你当我瞎啊？看身材不会吗？比起脸男人第一时间更爱看身材的啊，前凸又后翘，中间小 蛮腰，肯定是个女人。还有这种暴发户式的装潢，一般地方可看不到，你以为我不知道我 已经被运回了陈宅吗？陈宅的女人虽然多，但我就见过那么几个，介绍了名字的就一个蝶 儿，你要我猜，我当然只能猜蝶儿了，别人我连名字都不知道，怎么猜啊？谁知道一猜就 中？谁知道你这么沉不住气，连抵赖一下都不会，直接就掀开神秘的面纱了！ 他能说吗？能说吗？！你叫他怎么说得出口！只好作讳莫如深状了。 蝶儿  应该说剥皮魔，状态调整的很快，顶着陈老爷爱妾那张脸，重新找回了无比娇艳 又得意的笑容： “ 不错，正是我！沈清秋，你猜破脑袋也想不通，为何会是我这个柔弱女 子吧？ ” 沈清秋坐正歪了的身子，努力换一个潇洒一点、不至于太破格的姿势。 BOSS 有自白时间的传统，这个面子他不能不给。 蝶儿不需要他鼓励，自己说了下去： “ 剥皮魔来无影去无踪，不是因为有什么通天遁地之 能，而是因为，每次我杀完人之后，就换了一副新的皮囊。顶着那些女人的皮，模仿她们 的举止，神不知鬼不觉地混到凡人堆里，寻找下一个目标。 ” 沈清秋： “ 不对。 ” 蝶儿阴沉下脸： “ 哪里不对。 ” 沈清秋： “ 假使你每次杀完人就换了皮，比如杀掉蝶儿，占了她的皮囊，你就成了 ‘ 蝶儿 ’ ，可还有一具被剥了皮的尸体蝶儿，人们不会奇怪有两个蝶儿吗？ ” 想了想，他又豁然开朗。 这个世界又没有 DNA 鉴定技术，剥了皮，就都是血肉模糊的一团，很难分清楚谁到底是 谁。 蝶儿道： “ 看来你也明白了。不错。我会用后一名女子的尸体，来代替前一名女子的尸 体。比如我杀蝶儿时，身上穿的是香儿的皮，所有人都以为这时候香儿还活着；待到穿上 蝶儿的皮之后，蝶儿的尸体就被我伪装成香儿的尸体，被人发现。 ” 沈清秋也真是佩服这些反派，太有职业操守了，不但要揭露自己的心理活动，还要解释自 己的详细手法和作案思路。举例说明，现身说法，实在是 …… 比带高考班的老师还要认真 负责！ 洛冰河一直沉默地听着，目光闪烁，隐隐带着愤怒，少年的小小正义感被这丧心病狂的魔 族歹毒行径激起。宁婴婴被一串香香蝶蝶搅得昏头涨脑，完全听不明白，却不敢插嘴。 沈清秋道： “ 你每隔一段时间就要换皮，是兴之所至，还是不得如此？ ” 蝶儿冷笑道： “ 你以为我会告诉你吗？ ” 你已经告诉我很多了好吗大姐（还是大哥？），不差这一个。 蝶儿朝捆绑宁婴婴和洛冰河的地方走去。洛冰河镇定依旧，宁婴婴大叫： “ 魔物！不要过 来！师尊救我！ ” 蝶儿嘿嘿笑道： “ 你师尊被我用 ‘ 捆仙索 ’ 捆住了，周身灵力都无法流动，自身都难保，怎 么来救你？ ” 怪不得沈清秋刚才一直暗暗发力，都感觉灵力滞塞，没有以往那种充沛的感觉。 蝶儿又陷入了自言自语模式： “ 可恶，要不是我功体有损，哪里需要这样不断地换皮吸取 人气。你这小丫头皮肤水光嫩滑，又是名门弟子，估计能用上好一段时间。等你的皮被我 吸干了，就轮到你师父。修雅剑能为我所用，也算不枉此生了。 ” 洛冰河： “……” 沈清秋： “……” 你刚才说什么来着？ “ 你以为我会告诉你吗 ” 对吧？ 现在不光告诉我了，而且好像还说了什么不得了的东西，把将来计划也透露了！这个世界 的反派的职业素养没救了！ 沈清秋腆着脸和系统交流： “ 那啥 …… 如果在任务的途中出了差错，我被干掉了的话，给 不给一次读档重来的机会？ ” 系统：【金身不破是主角特权。】 好在反派素来有 “ 有问必答 ” 的优良品质，沈清秋想拖延时间，只消抛个问题给蝶儿： “ 你 不是向来只对年轻貌美的女子下手么？ ” “ 我又没说只对挑选年轻貌美的女人下手。只要是皮相好，皮肤细腻的人，我统统都会下 手，只是男人的皮肤多半没有女人好，老的皮总是没有年轻的好。 ” 蝶儿果然滔滔不绝地 说了下去，忽然两眼发绿，换了一副垂涎的嘴脸，一双涂了猩红丹蔻的手在沈清秋上身摸 了起来， “ 不过，修过仙功的人果然就是不一样。虽然是男人，却也肤质光滑细腻。我 …… 已经很久没用回男人的皮了 ……” 沈清秋被他一双手摸得鸡皮疙瘩直起，还要做出一副冰清玉洁不可侵犯的姿态。一边恶心 ，一边同情。 想来这魔物也有点可怜，看来他本来是个公的，却因为练功原因不得不老是用女人的皮， 长期以来，恐怕都心理变态了吧 …… 尽管如此，它毕竟顶着一张千娇百媚的小妾脸，沈清秋被这样摸来摸去，难免窘迫，不由 自主微微往后缩。 他这副样子，在洛冰河眼里看来，冲击力不是一般的大。 以往看多了沈清秋高高在上的姿态和冷嘲热讽的神情，这时候，却能见到这张脸难以控制 地泛起轻微红晕，眼神退避的模样，再加上沈清秋上身 □□ ，除了几条虽细却牢不可破的 捆仙索、被勒出的红痕，就只有乌黑的长发散落，欲掩不掩。洛冰河的胸腔爆满了一股难 以言述的纠结感。 如果让沈清秋给这种感觉来找一个比喻，这就像他看了一部唯美爱情动作片，结果发现主 角是那个每天上课都点他回答问题，回答不出来就抽打手心三百下的英语老师。既碎三观 又伤身！ 沈清秋忽然露齿一笑。 蝶儿警惕道： “ 你笑什么？ ” 沈清秋慢条斯理道： “ 我笑你，买椟还珠。这里有三个人，偏偏最适合用来当你皮囊的那 个，你却一直没注意到。 ” 洛冰河闻言脸色一变。 他怎么也想不到，莫名其妙的他就被坑下了水！ 沈清秋可没信口开河。洛冰河是什么人？人家的真实身份，可是上古天魔的后代。传说是 由天人堕化而成的魔族，简称天魔。未来的魔族小王子，血统，杠杠的。一般的魔物，如 果能得到他的皮囊，别说修复受损的功体了，要干什么没可能？ 蝶儿来回打量洛冰河。后者强作镇定，心里却茫然不知所措。想破脑袋也不明白，到底为 什么焦点会突然聚集在他身上。 蝶儿道： “ 你就算要骗我，也得撒个可信的谎。这小子虽然皮相根骨上佳，也鲜嫩得很， 怎么比得上你这个金丹中期？ ” 沈清秋笑道： “ 就你这眼光，难怪练功不成气候。你也不想想，我沈清秋是何等人物，若 这孩子当真只是根骨皮相上佳，一无是处，我为什么要收他入门做我弟子？我若是想要根 骨上佳的徒弟，每年挤着求入苍穹山派的人里天资聪颖的，难道还不够我挑？个中玄妙辛 秘，自然不可为外人道。 ” 蝶儿立刻就动摇了。很好，这反派果然智商奇低，太好骗了，这番临时想到漏洞百出的说 辞，他居然也将信将疑了！ 沈清秋趁热打铁： “ 你若怀疑，也很好办。我告诉你一个可以证明我的话的办法。你过去 ，往他天灵盖打上一掌，就知道我有没有骗你。 ” 洛冰河当场脸色煞白。 再怎么早熟，他现在也只是个孩子，哪怕是成人在面临死亡之时，都很少能有不色变的， 更何况他只有十四岁。 沈清秋努力不去看他，心里反复猛虎落地式道歉，冰哥你大人有大量原谅我这一回嘴炮坑 爹吧我再也不敢了日后我一定补救回来！ 宁婴婴吓坏了： “ 师 …… 师尊，您 …… 您不是说真的吧？ ” 沈清秋心如绷弦，哪顾得上哄她，只对蝶儿微笑道： “ 是不是真的，你一试便知。怎么， 只不过是在一个小小少年头上拍一掌而已，就算我骗你，你也不吃亏，不是么？还是说， 你担心我说的是真的，所以不敢拍这一掌呢？ ” 在不明白真相的人看来，这无疑是生生地在把洛冰河往死里推。 洛冰河不可置信。他茫茫然心想，难道沈清秋讨厌他，已经到了这种地步吗？ 既然如此，那在来时路上，又为什么要对他好了一点？ 他情不自禁地用力挣了起来，捆绑在身上的绳子不断绷紧，宁婴婴虽被扯得痛，却大气也 不敢出，只敢嘤嘤啜泣。 沈清秋的话语和口气都十分具有诱导性。蝶儿想了想，的确是那么回事，人都杀了不少， 难道它还怕打一掌不成！ 它哼道： “ 我倒要看看，你到底在搞什么鬼。 ” 说着大步朝洛冰河踏去，手起掌落！,"CHAPTER 7: BACKSTABBING THE MALE LEAD, NO. 1 Though only his upper half had been stripped naked, it was already horrifying enough. No matter what, Shen Qingqiu was a Peak Lord! This appearance, with his upper half stark naked, wearing only a pair of pants and white shoes, his four limbs bound tightly with a thin rope as he lay toppled on the floor, what! Was! This! He looked exactly like a tender pretty boy, caught in bed during an illicit act; no wonder the System had deducted 50 points straight off; it was deserved! Even a deduction to zero would serve him right! Shen Qingqiu’s face switched between red and white. He wanted to dig a hole in the ground with his sword and bury himself for a while, but his sword had disappeared without a trace. No wonder Luo Binghe just then had looked both worried and a little embarrassed. He was definitely thinking that since he’d seen Shen Qingqiu in such a sorry state, once they got back, there’d inevitably be vicious retaliation, again. Ning Yingying said, sobbing, “Shizun you finally woke up, Yingying is so scared…” Scared? If you’re scared then don’t run about as you please, young lady! Shen Qingqiu gave up. At this time, from behind him came an unsettling chuckle. A long, dark silhouette emerged from the pitch blackness. “What Cang Qiong Mountain, what Qing Jing Peak Peak Lord; this was all you were. If Cang Qiong Mountain, boasted to be the number one sect in the world, is all full of this sort, the day the demon race subjugates the human realm is just around the corner.” After speaking, there was another bout of crazy laughter. The other’s head and face was covered with a black veil, its voice hoarse and unpleasant, as if its throat had been ruined by opium smoke. Shen Qingqiu squinted. “The skinner demon?” “That’s right! That’s me; I’m the skinner demon! For the illustrious ‘Xiu Ya sword’ to have fallen into my hands today, how joyous! Shen Qingqiu ah Shen Qingqiu, even if you guess until your wits give out, you won’t be able toguess my identity!” Shen Qingqiu: “Why wouldn’t I be able to guess.” The skinner demon: “…” Shen Qingqiu: “You’re Die-er, aren’t you.” The skinner demon: “…” It lifted the veil, saying irritably, “Impossible! How did you guess!” Shen Qingqiu was speechless. You think I’m blind? That I can’t tell from your figure? At first glance, rather than faces, men love looking at bodies; that curvy top and bottom, that tiny waist in between, it definitely has to be a woman. Also, these nouveau-riche style furnishings can’t be found just anywhere; you think I don’t know that we’ve been transported back to Chen Manor? Chen Manor may have many women, but I’ve only seen a couple and was only introduced to Die-er; if you want me to guess, of course I can only guess Die-er; I don’t know anyone else’s names; how can I guess them? Who knew you’d lose your cool so easily, didn’t deny it even a little, and jumped right to lifting your veil! Could he say this? Could he? Tell him, how could he say this aloud! He could only swallow it all down. Die-eror should be said, the skinner demon, quickly adjusted itself and donned the face of Old Master Chen’s beloved concubine, retrieving once more that infinitely tender, stunning, yet gleeful smile. “Not bad, it was indeed me! Shen Qingqiu, even if you guess until your wits give out, you can’t understand why it was a weak and delicate woman like me, right?” Shen Qingqiu straightened his body, struggling to change his posture into one that was more natural, less rule-violating. BOSSes traditionally had a time when they would confess; he couldn’t not give this courtesy. Die-er didn’t need his encouragement, and continued by itself, “That the skinner demon vanishes without a trace, isn’t because I can fly through the skies or disappear into the earth, but rather because, every time after I finish killing a person, I change into a new skin. By wearing these women’s skins and imitating their behavior, I can blend into the crowd without anyone the wiser, and search for my next target.” Shen Qingqiu: “That’s not right.” Die-er’s expression darkened. “What’s not right.” Shen Qingqiu: “Suppose every time you killed a person you changed skins; for instance when you killed Die-er and occupied her skin, you became‘Die-er,’ but there’s still Die-er’s skinned corpse; wouldn’t someone find it strange that there are two Die-ers?” After thinking for a while, everything became clear again. It’s not like this world had DNA identification; after skinning, what was left would be a messy lump of bloody flesh, very difficult to tell exactly who it was. Die-er said, “Looks like you understand too. Not bad. I use the current woman’s corpse to substitute for the last woman’s. For example, when I killed Die-er, I was wearing Xiang-er’s skin, so everyone at that time thought Xiang-er was still alive; after I donned Die-er’s skin instead, Die-er’s corpse was disguised by me to look like Xiang-er’s, then found by the others.” Shen Qingqiu was truly impressed with these villains, having so much professional integrity; not only did they need to expose their inner thoughts and feelings, they also needed to explain in detail their methods and line of reasoning when committing the crime. Raising examples, giving personal experiences, they really were… more responsible and thorough than a cram school teacher for the college entrance exams! Luo Binghe had been silently listening the entire time, his eyes glittering and carrying a trace of anger, his juvenile sense of justice stirred up by this sick- minded demon’s cruel actions. Ning Yingying’s head was spinning from all the “Xiang”s and “Die”s; she couldn’t understand at all, but didn’t dare interrupt. Shen Qingqiu said, “After a certain amount of time, you always change skins; is this on a whim, or because you have to?” Die-er sneered and said, “You think I’d tell you?” You’ve already told me plenty, alright, sis (or was it bro?), what’s one more. Die-er walked towards where Ning Yingying and Luo Binghe were bound. Luo Binghe remained calm; Ning Yingying screamed, “Demon! Don’t come over! Shizun, save me!” Die-er chuckled and said, “Your shizun has been bound with my ‘Immortal Binding Cable;’ his entire body’s spiritual energy is incapable of flowing; he’d have difficulty protecting himself; how can he come save you?” No wonder, up to now Shen Qingqiu had been secretly exerting himself, but his spiritual power felt like it was obstructed, and lacked that plentiful sensation like in the past. Die-er had re-entered monologue mode. “Damn, if it weren’t for my qi circulation 41 being damaged, why would I need to do this, constantly changingskins and absorbing human qi. You brat, your skin is lustrous and tender, and you’re a disciple from a prestigious sect, I estimate you can be used for a good amount of time. After I suck your skin dry, it’ll be your master’s turn. That the 'Xiu Ya sword’ can be used by me, his life can be considered not in vain.” Luo Binghe: “…” Shen Qingqiu: “…” What did you just say? “You think I’d tell you,” right? Now, not only have you told me, you also seem to have said something incredible, and exposed your future plans as well! The professional quality of this world’s villains were beyond help! Shen Qingqiu shamelessly communicated to the System, “That uh… if a mistake happens during the quest, and I end up dead, will I be given a chance to reload and try again?” The System: An indestructible body is the protagonist’s special privilege. Good thing villains always had the excellent quality of “must answer all questions;” Shen Qingqiu wanted to stall for time, and needed only to toss a question at Die-er. “Haven’t you always only targeted young and beautiful girls?” “I’ve never said I only pick young and beautiful women as targets. As long as they’re good-looking, their skin fine and smooth, I’ll target anyone; it’s just that most of the time men’s skins are not as good as women’s, and the skin of the elderly also not as good as the youthful.” As expected, Die-er chattered on and on, then suddenly its eyes became green with envy, its expression changing into one of yearning, and it started to run its hands, painted with scarlet nail polish, over Shen Qingqiu’s upper body. “However, those who’ve cultivated before really are different. Even though you’re a man, your skin is also glossy and smooth. It’s… been so long since I’ve returned to using a man’s skin…” Being felt up by his hands, Shen Qingqiu broke out in goosebumps, yet still needed to give off an attitude of being spotless and untouchable. Part of him was disgusted, another part sympathetic. Thinking about it, this demon was also a bit pitiful; looked like he was originally male, but because of his martial training, he kept having to use women’s skins, after such a long time, perhaps even his mind had become twisted… Despite that, in the end it was wearing the infinitely lovely face of a concubine; being felt up here and there like this, Shen Qingqiu inevitably became embarrassed, and involuntarily shrank back a little.This appearance of his, in Luo Binghe’s eyes, made an extraordinarily large impact. In the past, all he’d seen of Shen Qingqiu was an aloof and remote attitude, a derisive expression, yet at this time, he could see a faint, uncontrollable red flush form on that face, the way those eyes darted away; plus Shen Qingqiu’s upper body was completely bare, other than the thin yet unbreakable Immortal Binding Cable and the red marks it left, there was only his long, scattered, jet-black hair, which failed to conceal anything. Luo Binghe’s chest was bursting with a hard-to-describe, convoluted emotion. If you let Shen Qingqiu find an analogy for this emotion, it was like watching a beautiful romance movie, only to discover at the end that the protagonist was that English teacher who’d always picked on him to answer questions, and if he couldn’t answer would give his palm three hundred lashes. It both shattered his world views and injured him. Shen Qingqiu suddenly grinned. Die-er said, wary, “Why are you smiling?” Shen Qingqiu slowly and deliberately said, “I’m amused at you, at your poor judgment 42 . There are three people here, yet out of everyone, you keep overlooking the one most suitable to be your vessel. Upon hearing these words, Luo Binghe’s face went pale. He could never have imagined he’d be randomly thrown to the wolves 43 ! Shen Qingqiu wasn’t speaking thoughtlessly. Who was Luo Binghe? His true identity was a descendent of ancient heavenly demons. Legend said that they were denizens of the heavens who’d fallen into depravity and become demons, so they were called “heavenly demons” for short. As the future princes of demon-kind, their bloodline was first-class. If an ordinary demon could obtain their body, forget only repairing damaged qi circulation, was there anything it couldn’t do? Die-er looked Luo Binghe up and down. The latter strived to appear calm, but inside he was panicking and completely at a loss. Even if he thought until his wits gave out he couldn’t understand why the focus had turned to him. Die-er said, “Even if you want to trick me, you need a better lie. This brat’s appearance and aptitude may be exemplary, and he’s fresh and tender, but how can he compare to you, who’s in the Mid-Core Formation stage? Shen Qingqiu said while smiling, “With your level of insight, no wonder your martial training was unsuccessful. Why don’t you think about it, as Shen Qingqiu, what kind of person am I; if this child only possessed an excellentaptitude and appearance, why would I accept him as my disciple? If I only wanted a disciple with excellent aptitude, every year among the people fighting to enter Cang Qiong Mountain Sect, could I not have enough talent to pick and choose from? Naturally, our secrets wouldn’t be known to outsiders.” Die-er immediately wavered. Excellent, this villain’s IQ was truly ridiculously low, so easy to trick; an explanation like this that had been conjured on the spot and so full of holes, he could actually manage to half-believe it! Shen Qingqiu struck while the iron was hot. “If you’re suspicious, there’s an easy solution. I’ll tell you a method that can verify my words. Go over there, aim a strike at the crown of his head, then you’ll know whether or not I’m lying.” At that moment, Luo Binghe’s face became a ghastly white. No matter how mature, right now he was still a child; even if it were grown men facing their deaths, very few would be unaffected, let alone he who was only fourteen years old. Shen Qingqiu tried very hard not to look at him, and desperately apologized in his heart over and over again, Bing-ge you’re a man of virtue please magnanimously forgive my smack-talking and backstabbing this time okay I’ll never do it again I’ll definitely make it up to you in the future! Ning Yingying was scared witless. “Shi… Shizun, you… you can’t be serious?” Shen Qingqiu was on tenterhooks and had no mind to comfort her; he only smiled at Die-er and said, “Whether or not I’m telling the truth, you’ll know as soon as you try. What, it’s only giving an insignificant boy a single strike; even if I was lying to you, you wouldn’t lose anything, would you? Or, are you worried that I’m telling the truth, so you dare not hit him?” In the eyes of a person who didn’t know the truth, this was undoubtedly pushing Luo Binghe to his death. Luo Binghe was in disbelief. He blankly thought, had Shen Qingqiu’s hatred for him truly already reached such a degree? If that was the case, why be a little nicer to him on the way here? He couldn’t help but start struggling with all his might; the ropes restraining his body became tighter and tighter, biting painfully into Ning Yingying, but she didn’t even dare breathe loudly, and just quietly sobbed. Shen Qingqiu’s words and tone were incredibly persuasive. Die-er thought for a while, that’s true, it’d already killed so many people, how could it be afraid of giving a single strike!It snorted and said, “I want to see, exactly what sort of fool thing you’re pulling.” As it said this it strode towards Luo Binghe, and brought its palm down!"
机会只有一瞬间！沈清秋瞳孔骤缩！ 就在那一掌即将落下之时，鬼使神差地，一根房梁断了 …… 如果沈清秋现在还是《狂傲仙魔途》的读者，看到这里，他绝对要摔手机破口大骂。 系统已经表态了，万年不破的铁血规则，就是主角不死。也就是说，一旦威胁到主角性命 ，就会触发死亡 > 沈清秋故意唆使蝶儿去攻击洛冰河，就是为了利用这一规则，借刀杀人。虽然这样 …… 很 不厚道，可洛冰河多半不会受到威胁；而如果不这么做，弄不好沈清秋就要直接在这里交 待了。把目光放长远，在这里坑一把洛冰河，今后还是有机会刷会好感度的。 可是。 向天打飞机菊苣你把读者的智商当什么！好端端的一座美轮美奂的新宅子，怎么会房梁突 然塌了！ 就算要让主角死里逃生，这转的也太生硬了。跟狗血三流电视剧男女主人公都要回老家结 婚了结果一辆车飞来强行 BE 有什么区别？差评！ 那根几乎是全新的房梁不偏不倚，刚好莫名其妙砸中了蝶儿，把它整个人几乎拍扁在地上 ，爬不起来。而且还连带莫名其妙砸歪了绑住洛冰河和宁婴婴的柱子。宁婴婴已经吓晕过 去，洛冰河一阵挣扎，又莫名其妙的松绑了。 一连串的莫名其妙之后，沈清秋被捆仙索栓在地上，看着洛冰河愣在扑街的蝶儿旁边，陷 入了谜之沉默。 就这么 …… 完事了？ 他刚这么想，蝶儿就掀翻了那根房梁，一跃而起。 他暴怒道； “ 沈清秋！苍穹山的人果然卑鄙无耻工于心计！你刚才使了什么阴险法子，这 样在背后陷害我？ ” 沈清秋真是无辜的很。这不关他的事，真的。罪魁祸首应该是洛冰河。 蝶儿不依不饶道： “ 你果然在故意骗我，想引开我的注意，好偷袭我。不然为什么好端端 地这根房梁会砸下来，还刚好砸中我？ ” 他/ 她也机智地注意到剧情的不合理之处了，智商可以抢救！沈清秋有点欣慰。 蝶儿冷笑道： “ 你以为这样就能制住我了？做梦。捆仙索除非用仙家宝剑才能斩断，用普 通的方法你别想挣开。 ” …… 刚表扬了你你就又犯傻。放开敌人的方法不要说出来啊亲！ 还有你是怕我看不到你把修雅剑放在哪里了吗？还特地把它从斗篷的腰间露出来拍了拍！ 沈清秋按捺不住激动之情，抽空和系统交流一下： “ 我就问问。所有的反派，都是走这个 路子的吗？ ” 系统：【为了保证贵方能顺利通过初级阶段任务，开启简单模式后，反派的智商设定在平 均水准以下。】 原来不是所有的 BOSS 都这么好混，沈清秋有点遗憾，仍大力点赞： “ 你们这个简单模式的 设计太人性化了，好评好评。 ” 蝶儿咬牙切齿： “ 这次无论你再说什么我都不会听了！受死吧沈清秋！ ” 沈清秋叫道： “ 最后一句！ ” 在简单模式的威力下，蝶儿果然停住了： “ 你还有什么遗言？ ” 沈清秋想了想，问道： “ 跟六十岁老头子睡觉的滋味如何？ ” “……” 趁蝶儿气到脸色扭曲、浑身都颤抖了起来，后方的洛冰河突然一扑而上！ 他夺下蝶儿佩在腰间的修雅剑，拔剑出鞘，满室澄然雪光。 银影划过，沈清秋身上的捆仙索齐齐断开。 只怪蝶儿这个小 Boss 的智商在简单模式下没有达到平均值，洛冰河一个活人站在他身后， 他直接当是死的。 蝶儿惊叫： “ 这不可能 ” 够了！我是不听派！ Boss 死前的例行自我心路剖析我不想听！沈清秋嘴角抽了抽，一股脑 把灵力凝聚在右手，一掌击出，拍在蝶儿胸口。后者顿时如断了线的风筝一样横飞出去。 这是沈清秋第一次动杀手。可他一点也没有手软。第一这是一本书；第二这是杀人无数的 妖魔；第三他不动手死的就是自己。 沈清秋看了一眼 “ 蝶儿 ” 四肢曲折、七窍流血的惨状，转过头，用上面那三条理由刷了满脑 的弹幕。强作镇定，缓缓站直，平心收气，摆好姿势，转向洛冰河： “ 第一次看 ‘ 除魔卫 道’ ，吓到了？ ” 洛冰河尚显稚气的脸微微发白。 沈清秋自若道： “ 如果要 ‘ 卫 ’ ，就一定要 ‘ 除 ’ 。 ” 洛冰河咬了咬牙，颤声道： “ 师尊，徒儿斗胆问一句，刚才 ……” 等不来后半截，沈清秋道： “ 你想问，如果刚才房梁没有忽然塌下来，为师到底打算怎么 办？ ” 沈清秋哑巴吃黄连，他真的很想告诉洛冰河，你放心，就算房梁不塌，也有可能墙塌，就 算墙不塌，也有可能柱子塌。总而言之，你一定不会死 BOSS 一定要死就是了 …… 这话难以启齿，他只得故作莫测，顾左右而言他： “ 你这可算是在责难为师？ ” 洛冰河摇头，神色诚恳道： “ 不。若能为师尊付出性命，于弟子而言乃是荣幸。 ” …… 沈清秋被他的白莲花程度震到了！ 沈清秋想了想，选择了一个比较暧昧的说法： “ 那为师也告诉你。即便为师出事，你也不 会有任何不测。 ” 这真是大实话。就算沈清秋死一百次啊一百次，金身不破的主角洛冰河也能活得好好的！ 他神色笃定且淡定，没有半点违心的模样，语音铿锵道： “ 这一点，绝无欺瞒。 ” 洛冰河听了这话，仿佛被点燃了生机，刚才焉下去一点点的向阳花立刻又生机勃 □□ 来， 双手持剑，举到与眉齐平，奉上呈给沈清秋： “ 师尊。您的剑！ ” 沈清秋一把接过。心内抹了把汗，这孩子现在真好忽悠，刚才都被坑的魂飞天外了，转眼 三言两语又能满血复活。但日后就没这么好糊弄了。成长真是一条荆棘丛生的残酷道路 …… 接下来，连珠炮一般的系统提示让他爽翻了天。 【宁婴婴好感度上升，主角爽度 +50 】 【获得高级物品 ‘ 捆仙索 ’ ，反派实力 +30 】 【完成初级阶段任务， B 格 + 功能解冻。从此刻起，贵方可完全掌控沈清秋账号的操控 权。恭喜！请再接再励。】 沈清秋有点爱上这种博弈般大起大落乍喜乍悲的感觉了。 OOC 功能已解冻，从此刻开始，终于可以着手进行抱男主大腿的伟大光荣事业了！ 回到苍穹山的第一件事，就是登上掌门镇守的穹顶峰，向岳清源汇报工作。 此前沈清秋一直觉得，这位掌门师兄就是个发布任务的 NPC 般的存在。不过这种感觉，在 他踏入山门后就消失得无影无踪。 他还没踏入大堂，岳清源就领着身后穹顶峰的弟子们迎了上来。两人刚打了个照面，未语 先笑，岳清源右手便捉住了沈清秋的脉门。 沈清秋倏地一惊，然而岳清源没有更多动作，而是凝神细察，输入了一股微弱的灵流，就 知道他只是在察看自己体内的灵息状况，放下心来。 片刻之后，岳清源放开了手，笑着和沈清秋一同迈入大堂。问道： “ 历练如何？ ” 他这种家中长兄一般的语气让沈清秋想起了自己两个哥哥，略为伤感，而更多的是温馨之 意，连沮丧的话也说得乐呵呵的： “ 不尽人意。 ” 弟子们连那剥皮魔人的影儿都没见着，从历练弟子的角度来讲，的确不尽人意。 岳清源道： “ 不急于一时。 ” 沈清秋点点头，忽的话题一转： “ 掌门师兄，我要入穹顶峰后山灵犀洞闭关。 ” 穹顶峰身为十二峰之首，自然最能集天地之精华。而灵犀洞，则是穹顶峰最佳的修炼去处 ，事半功倍。因此，派中长辈级人物或优秀的弟子都可向掌门请求入洞修行闭关。只有得 到掌门的首肯，申请才能通过。 沈清秋要去灵犀洞闭关，岳清源当然不会不肯。可他唇边笑意却凝了凝，神色微变。 沈清秋觉察有异，然而这丝异常一闪而过，岳清源又温和地问道： “ 可是为仙盟大会？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 正是。 ” 不光是因为仙盟大会，这次的剥皮魔事件让沈清秋越发认识到了老实修炼的重要性。在这 个世界里，有实力才有资格想将来的事。毕竟不是每次都有简单模式和智商低于平均值的 > 闭关前，沈清秋把洛冰河叫来，把正确的入门心法交给了他。 洛冰河接过心法，问道： “ 师尊为何要给弟子一本完全不同的心法？ ” 沈清秋一本正经胡说八道： “ 你体质有所不同，不能按照本门的一般心法来修行。 ” 他可不想亲自揭露沈清秋授意明帆给洛冰河假心法的真相，虽然迟早都是要败露的。 望着沈清秋远去的背影，洛冰河捧着那本心法，内心受到极大震动。 这是师尊专门给他一个人的心法！ 沈清秋偶尔一回头，见他还呆呆站在原地，揉揉眉心继续走。 虽然不知道洛冰河在想什么，但应该是想多了 ……,"CHAPTER 8: GIVING SWEETS AFTER BACKSTABBING The chance was only an instant! Shen Qingqiu’s pupils contracted. Right as that strike came down, in a curious coincidence, a ceiling beam broke… If Shen Qingqiu had still been a reader of Proud Immortal Demon Way , upon seeing this, he would definitely have thrown down his cellphone and started screaming curses. The System had already declared: the unbreakable, ironclad rule was that the protagonist could not die. Which also meant, as soon as the protagonist’s life was threatened, a death flag would be triggered! Shen Qingqiu purposely goading Die-er into attacking Luo Binghe, was for the sake of taking advantage of this rule, using someone else to do his dirty work. Even though this was… rather unjust, but Luo Binghe most likely wouldn’t have been in danger; and if he hadn’t done this, and failed to do a good job, Shen Qingqiu would have had to directly pay the price here himself. Taking the long-term view, even if he threw Luo Binghe under the bus this one time, there would still be opportunity to curry favor in the future. However. “Great Master” Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky, how do you see your reader’s IQs! In a perfectly fine, splendid, and beautiful new mansion, how could a ceiling beam suddenly snap! Even if it was to let the protagonist escape with his life, this twist was still too contrived. What was the difference between this and a third-rate dog-blood drama where the male and female leads were about to marry, then were hit by a car in a forced bad end? Thumbs down! That pretty-much brand-new ceiling beam fell straight down, and just happened to coincidentally smash into Die-er, smacking him flat onto the ground, unable to get up. And the beam also coincidentally smashed into the pillar Luo Binghe and Ning Yingying were bound to, causing it to slant. Ning Yingying had already fainted from shock; after struggling for a while, Luo Binghe’s ropes also coincidentally loosened. After this series of coincidences, Shen Qingqiu, tied up on the ground by the Immortal Binding Cable, watched as Luo Binghe stopped, distracted, next tothe fallen Die-er, entering into a puzzling silence. Was this… it? Just as he’d thought this, Die-er overturned that ceiling beam, and sprang up. Enraged, he said, “Shen Qingqiu! Those from Cang Qiong Mountains are truly shameless and underhanded, full of schemes! Just now, what sort of dirty trick did you use, to ambush me from behind like that? Shen QIngqiu was truly completely innocent. Nothing to do with him, really, the chief culprit should be Luo Binghe. Die-er was unforgiving, and said, “So you really were purposely lying to me, trying to draw my attention away so you could sneak attack me. Otherwise why would a perfectly good ceiling beam come crashing down, and just happen to smash into me?” He/she also had the wits to notice the parts of the scene that were illogical, his/her IQ wasn’t beyond saving! Shen Qingqiu was a little relieved. Die-er sneered and said, “You thought this was enough to stop me? Keep dreaming. The Immortal Binding Cable can only be cut with an immortal’s sword; forget about breaking it through normal methods.” I just praised you and you goof up again. Don’t reveal how to free the enemy! Also, are you afraid I can’t see where you put Xiu Ya? You even specially drew back your cloak to show its place on your hip, and patted it! Shen Qingqiu couldn’t contain his agitation, and took a chance to communicate a little with the System, “I need to ask. Do all villains follow this mold?” The System: To guarantee that you can smoothly clear the introductory level quest, after activating Easy Mode, the villain’s IQ was set to be below average. So not all BOSSes were this easy to fumble through; Shen Qingqiu thought it was a bit of a pity, but still smashed the like button. “This Easy Mode of yours is really too user-friendly, thumbs up thumbs up.” Dier-er gritted its teeth. “I won’t listen to you no matter what you say this time! Accept your death, Shen Qingqiu!” Shen Qingqiu shouted, “One last thing!” Sure enough, under the power of Easy Mode, Die-er stopped. “What last words do you still have?” Shen Qingqiu thought for a while, then asked, “How does it feel to sleepwith a sixty-year-old old coot?” “…” Die-er was so enraged, its expression twisted, its entire body starting to tremble; taking this chance, Luo Binghe suddenly rushed it from behind! He snatched Xiu Ya from Die-er’s hip and drew the sword, purifying the entire room with white light. A curved flash of silver, and the Immortal Binding Cable on Shen Qingqiu’s body was neatly severed. One could only blame this small BOSS Die-er’s IQ for being below average in Easy Mode; a living, breathing Luo Binghe had been standing right behind him, and he’d completely ignored his existence. Die-er cried out in fear, “This is impossible” Enough! I hate listening to these 44 ! I don’t want to hear a perfunctory analysis of the BOSS’s motives right before its death! The corner of Shen Qingqiu’s mouth twitched, and he gathered all his spiritual power into his right hand, sending out a palm strike and smacking Die-er in the chest. The latter immediately flew back, like a kite with its string snapped. This was Shen Qingqiu’s first time killing someone. But he didn’t hold back even a little. First because this was a book; second this was a demon who’d killed countless people; third because if he didn’t the one dead would be himself. Shen Qingqiu glanced at “Die-er’s” horrible state: four limbs twisted and broken, bleeding from the qiqiao 45 , and turned his head, carving the above three reasons over and over into his brain 46 . Striving to remain calm, he slowly stood and straightened, settled his heart and breathing, fixed his posture, then turned to Luo Binghe. “This was your first time seeing someone ‘eliminate demons and uphold justice 47 ;’ were you scared?” Luo Binghe’s still-childish face turned slightly pale. Shen Qingqiu said, composed, “If you wish to ‘uphold,’ you must ‘eliminate.’” Luo Binghe gritted his teeth, saying in a quavering voice, “Shizun, if this disciple may be so bold to ask, just now…” When the second half of the sentence didn’t arrive, Shen Qingqiu said, “You want to ask, if just now that ceiling beam hadn’t suddenly come crashing down, what this master’s plan was?” Shen Qingqiu had no choice but to suffer in silence; he really wanted to tell Luo Binghe, don’t worry, even if the ceiling beam hadn’t collapsed, perhaps the wall would have; even if the wall hadn’t, perhaps the pillar would have. Long story short, you definitely wouldn’t have died, the BOSS definitely wouldhave, that’s all… These words were incredibly difficult to say, so he could only play at being unpredictable, and evade the question by changing the subject. “To ask this, are you blaming this master?” Luo Binghe shook his head, and said with a sincere expression, “No. If this disciple can give up his life for Shizun, it would be an honor.” Shen Qingqiu was shaken by how much of a white lotus he was! Shen Qingqiu thought for a while, first choosing a more ambiguous wording. “Then this master will also tell you. Even if an accident befalls this master, no mishaps will happen to you.” This was an absolute truth. Even if Shen Qingqiu died one hundred times ah, one hundred times; Luo Binghe, as the protagonist with an indestructible body, would still go on living, perfectly well! His expression was confident and collected, without the slightest appearance of falsity, voice resounding as he said, “On this, I absolutely am not lying.” Upon Luo Binghe hearing these words, it was as if his vitality had been ignited, the sunflower that had been slightly listless just now became full of vigor again; holding the sword in both hands, he lifted it until it was even with his brows, presenting it to Shen Qingqiu. “Shizun, your sword!” Shen Qingqiu grasped it, taking it from him. Internally, he wiped at his sweat: currently, this child is so easy to dupe; just now he’d been thrown under the bus, frightened out of his wits, yet in a blink, had been revived and restored to full health with only a couple of words. But in the future he wouldn’t be so easy to fool. The path of growing up was truly filled with thorns and suffering… Next, came System alerts like a series of cannon blasts, putting him on cloud nine. Ning Yingying’s favor has increased; protagonist satisfaction points +50 Obtained high level object ‘Immortal Binding Cable,’ villain strength +30 Completed the introductory level quest, B-points +200. OOC feature unfrozen. From this point on, you have full command over the Shen Qingqiu account’s controls. Congratulations! Please continue to work hard. Shen Qingqiu had fallen a little in love with this gambling-like sensation, with the dramatic ups and downs, the intense joys and sorrows. The OOC feature was already unfrozen; from this point on, he could finally carry out the great and glorious task of clinging to the male lead’s thighs! Upon returning to Cang Qiong Mountains, the first thing was to ascendQiong Ding Peak, safeguarded by the Sect Leader, and report to Yue Qingyuan about his work. Previously Shen Qingqiu had always thought, this Zhangmen-shixiong’s existence was just like a quest-giving NPC. But as soon as he entered the mountain gates, this feeling disappeared without a trace. He had yet to enter the main hall, when Yue Qingyuan led the Qiong Ding Peak disciples following behind him to welcome him. The two of them had just come face-to-face and smiled at each other, having yet to say anything, when Yue Qingyuan’s right hand grasped Shen Qingqiu’s pulse. Shen Qingqiu was instantly surprised, however Yue Qingyuan made no further movements and instead examined him attentively, inserting a weak spiritual flow; he then knew that Yue Qingyuan was only inspecting his body’s spiritual circulation, and became at ease. After a moment, Yue Qingyuan let go, and smiling, walked with Shen Qingqiu into the main hall. He asked, “How was the training?” His tone was like that of an eldest brother, and made Shen Qingqiu remember his own two brothers; he felt a slight sorrow, but still greater was a sense of comforting warmth, to the point that even his dejected words came out joyful. “Unsatisfactory.” His disciples didn’t even get to see the skinner demon’s shadow; speaking from the angle of training disciples, it truly was unsatisfactory. Yue Qingyuan said, “No need to rush.” Shen Qingqiu nodded, then suddenly changed the topic. “Zhangmen- shixiong, I want to go to Qiong Ding Peak’s back area, and enter secluded cultivation within Ling Xi Caves.” Qiong Ding Peak was the head of the Twelve Peaks, and naturally could collect the world’s essence. And as for Ling Xi Caves, it was Qiong Ding Peak’s best location for cultivating, giving twice the results in half the time. Therefore, the Sect’s most senior members or outstanding disciples could request the Sect Leader to enter the caves for secluded cultivation. Only with the Sect Leader’s approval, could the request be acted upon. If Shen Qingqiu wanted to enter seclusion in Ling Xi Caves, of course Yue Qingyuan wouldn’t refuse. But the smile on his lips froze a little, his expression changing slightly. Shen Qingqiu sensed that something was strange, but this strangeness flashed by, and Yue Qingyuan was once again gently asking him, “For the Immortal Alliance Conference?”Shen Qingqiu said, “That’s correct.” It wasn’t only because of the Immortal Alliance Conference, this incident with the skinner demon made Shen Qingqiu understand more the importance of honest cultivating. In this world, only if you have strength do you have the right to think about the future. After all, bosses wouldn’t always be on Easy Mode and with below average intelligence. Before entering seclusion, Shen Qingqiu called Luo Binghe over, and handed him the correct cultivation manual. Luo Binghe received it and asked, “Why is Shizun giving this disciple a completely different manual?” Shen Qingqiu solemnly bullshitted, “Your constitution is a little different, so you can’t cultivate by following ordinary methods.” He didn’t want to personally reveal the truth, that Shen Qingqiu had incited Ming Fan to give Luo Binghe a fake cultivation manual, even though eventually it would all be exposed. Staring after Shen Qingqiu’s retreating back, Luo Binghe held that manual in both hands, his heart incredibly shaken. This was the manual Shizun had specially given only to him! Shen Qingqiu glanced back occasionally and saw him still standing dumbly there; he rubbed at the spot between his brows and kept walking. Even though he didn’t know what Luo Binghe was thinking, he was probably thinking too much…"
灵犀洞内曲径幽深，百转千回后，就是别有洞天的一番天地，无风无月，却清凉静谧。白 石如云，青石如翠，生出了许多大大小小的奇观和天然石床。中心还有一潭碧水，镜子一 般映出另一个世界。 唯一美中不足的地方是上一个在这里闭关的前辈可能不太爱护公共设施，洞壁被刀影剑气 劈出无数纵横沟壑，连片的血瀑凝固在石壁上，已经发黑。 这只是许许多多个洞府其中的一个，虽然有点疑似凶杀现场，但沈清秋很满意，不打算再 另寻地方了。往石床上一坐，开始照着背下来的典籍潜心修习。 然而，仿佛老天就是不肯让他老老实实刷 B 格，没打坐多久，他就听到了一阵异样的动 静。 低喘声。 人在痛苦时的低喘声。 同时，他觉察了一阵几近暴走的灵力波动。 好吧。沈清秋知道发生什么了。 灵犀洞这么大，自然不可能只有他一个人能通过申请进来闭关，这里还有别人也在修炼， 而且 …… 走火入魔了，现在正值紧要关头。 我！只！是！想！闭！关！修！个！炼！刷！刷！武！力！值！而！已！要不要这样？ 要！不！要！ 沈清秋倏地睁开双眼，决定去探查一番。他顺着那声音和灵力波动传来的方向走去，随着 在洞中七转八弯，动静越来越大。 最终，他进入了另一处洞穴。一进去就看到一道白衣身影背对着他，一柄长剑插入石中， 直没入柄。 洞中剑气乱射，毫无章法。看那白衣人身上血迹斑斑，像受害者；可看他动作，又像杀人 狂魔。 这位走火入魔得相当惨烈啊！ 沈清秋琢磨着就自己这胡天胡地半桶水的搞法，如果上去给梳理对方灵流，到底是帮忙的 可能性更大还是捅刀的可能性更大，就在这时，他一眼瞥见了那柄剑。 此刻因为主人灵力暴走，剑身颤动不止，正一点一点自发外拔，发出刺耳的尖鸣，银光顺 着剑柄上暗镂的咒文和鸾凤纹饰流走不息。 沈清秋一眼就认出了这是什么剑、谁的剑。 妈蛋！ 好死不死遇上这个人！ 如果他刚才还存着帮忙的意，这下就只剩逃命的心了。然而已经迟了。那白衣人猛一回头 ，已经发现了他的存在！ 沈清秋可根本没心思赞一句 “ 美男子！ ” ，再美的男子如果两眼猩红青筋暴起地瞪着你，也 是要跪好么！ 他甩袖就跑，那男子一掌拍在石壁上，飞石四溅，长剑终于破石而出，横空飞来，刚好钉 在沈清秋眼前，截断了他的去路，再跑快那么一点刹不住脚，沈清秋就要被当场斩首。一 瞬间，失去理智的白衣人已抢上前来。 沈清秋见跑已来不及，只能硬着头皮上了。他把灵力汇于右手，孤注一掷地往对方胸口一 拍。 如果这个人真的像传说中那样，有着几乎可与主角这挂逼一战的武力值，那么这一掌铁定 是屁用没有的。不但屁用没有，说不定沈清秋还要被震飞到三丈之外、口吐鲜血什么的。 可是，居然有用，被震飞到三尺之外，口吐鲜血的，居然不是沈清秋，而是对方！ 那一刻，沈清秋举着自己的右手，看着被自己一掌打趴的白衣人，深深地觉得，自己不用 装也这么 NB ！ 其实走火入魔的人发起狂来固然可怕，但也很脆弱，要是运气够好，没准也就一巴掌拍断 了支撑他的最后一根稻草。 沈清秋表情纠结地看着那人痛苦地半跪在地上，强行挣扎着要站起来撕了他，却一再膝盖 重重落地，最终还是叹了口气，靠了过去，把手放到他背上。 “ 先说好。 ” 沈清秋也不管他听不听得懂，自顾自道： “ 再不救你就来不及了。这个操作我 也不熟，万一你 …… 呵呵了，好歹我也算尽了力，你千万别怪我。 ” 不知过了多久，沈清秋感觉那人体内灵息逐渐平复，游走正常，一颗心才慢慢放下来，撤 回了手掌。余下的，就是祈祷他死马当活马医没让对方修为倒退什么的。 被他歪打正着救回来的这位轻垂着头，还未清醒。 沈清秋其实已经猜出这个人的身份，系统提示音让他彻底确认了。 【恭喜！系统提示：改变剧情 “ 柳清歌之死 ” ，反派沈清秋作死值与仇恨值下降， B 格 +200 ！】 果然。 这是他的同门师弟。也是又一个死在原著沈清秋手下的冤大头。 苍穹山十二峰的百战峰主人，柳清歌。 柳清歌，是个很 NB 的角色。 苍穹十二峰，每一峰各有千秋，特色鲜明。比如，为首的穹顶峰统领大局，俯瞰群岭；沈 清秋的清静峰是知识分子和文艺青年的最爱；万剑峰因天时地利人和，自古多出铸剑大师 ；苦行峰一听名字就知道干什么的，拿鞭子抽沈清秋他都不想去；仙姝峰是个引人垂涎的 存在。因为这一峰只收女弟子，而且历来弟子颜值很高，美女如云。 WS 读者写的 YY 同人 层出不穷，百花齐放，其中《霸道仙姝爱上我》、《在仙姝峰左拥右抱的日子》等佳作可 谓是个中翘楚，遣词造句之小学生，情节桥段之香艳没下限，流传之广影响力之大，几乎 能与原著比肩。 但是其中，年轻人最喜欢、最崇拜、最热衷于加入的，绝对是柳清歌坐镇的百战峰！ 这是苍穹山最好战的一脉，也是战斗力最强的一脉。 历代百战峰峰主无一不是剑术绝顶的人物，百战常胜，不败神话，何其热血，拉风！ 男读者总是格外欣赏强者，柳清歌虽然没正式出场，但不乏武力值拥趸，沈垣尤其神往此 君。他脑补的柳清歌形象是一个威武雄壮的犀利汉子。战神哪！ 沈清秋低头看了看那张妍若好女的面容，梦碎，魂断。一直以来心中的幻想，破灭了。 战无不胜的百战峰主人，为什么本尊画风完全不对，这分明是个插花折柳的翩翩公子少年 郎！ 长成这样你对得起你那一堆武力粉的脑补吗？！ 可想想，也说得通。柳清歌是第一正牌女主角、绝世美女柳溟烟的哥哥。主角的老婆，质 量肯定杠杠的。基因的力量是强大的、科学的！ 战无不胜，性格嚣张，脸好看。这样的人，有了冰哥，不需要第二个了。难怪打飞机菊苣 要早早把他写死。 主角之外的人也敢堆这么多设定？分分钟不是破格炮灰就是死！ 刚才没考虑到这层，现在想想，他把这人救了会不会影响洛冰河的爽度啊？ 柳清歌着墨不多，可他还有一个很重要的存在意义，就是用来刷沈清秋的人渣下限。 柳沈二人虽是同门师兄弟，互相之间却一向有龃龉。 这也是为什么刚才沈清秋特想逃跑的原因。本来平时就不对盘的两个人，一方走火入魔了 ，要么是他追着把沈清秋砍死，要么是沈清秋像原作那样把他害死。 虽不知到底有什么深仇大恨，但原作沈清秋是杀柳清歌的凶手，是铁打的事实。这一事件 的揭发，也是推动沈清秋走向身败名裂的直接原因（之一）。原著谴责沈清秋的台词是 “ 趁其修炼时稍有岔漏，竟插手置之死地 ” ，大概就是在这里动手的。 沈清秋杀了女主角唯一的亲人，洛冰河当然要给他老婆报仇啦。沈清秋这个角色的仇恨点 真不是一般的密集啊！ 沈清秋还在那里为自己的未来忧心忡忡，这边柳清歌吐完了血，终于悠悠转醒。 一睁眼，就看到沈清秋神色甚闲地坐在附近，端着架子看他，那模样怎么看怎么不怀好意 ，心中警铃大作，猛的要坐起来防备，却牵动刚刚受过重创的内脏，内息大乱，又是一口 血喷出来。 这边沈清秋凉凉地道： “ 师弟，调息，不要这么激动。身为百战峰主人，怎能如此狼狈。 来！擦一擦。 ” 说着递了一方手帕过去。 柳清歌边吐血边道： “ 沈 …… 你又想搞什么鬼 ……” 沈清秋看他实在艰难，就在他背上轻拍了一掌。 本来柳清歌以为他要加害自己，奈何躲不开，等到与那一掌接触，才感觉一道清和平顺的 灵气灌入，在四肢规律地游走，助他理顺气息。 这下子，柳清歌简直比沈清秋背后阴他还骇然。毕竟阴他这码子事，已经习惯了。 沈清秋一边给他拍背，一边语重心长： “ 柳师弟，其实，最近师兄闭关，多有感悟。再看 你方才命悬一线，险些香消玉 …… 咳英年早逝，忆起昨日种种，师兄分外惭愧，倍感悔 恨。 ” 柳清歌似乎吐得更严重了。 沈清秋委婉示好： “ 不如你我从此以后抛却前尘，携手共进，做一对模范师兄弟，同门友 爱。师弟你看如何？ ” 直球有点羞耻，不过既然他现在没有杀柳清歌，拉仇恨值的剧情已经被扭转了，为什么不 做得更彻底一点，干脆跟柳清歌搞好关系？说不定柳还能成为自己的后盾呢？！ 柳清歌脸色奇差。他看了沈清秋的眼睛一会儿，终于像是忍无可忍地道： “ 你，走远点。 ” 沈清秋表示理解。 毕竟互相嫌恶了这么多年，一时半会儿肯定好感度刷不上去。这事儿不能急，得慢慢来。 他点了点头，说走就走，边走边头也不回地挥手道： “ 师弟要是练功时又出了什么岔子， 莫要害羞，大可呼唤师兄来帮忙。大家隔得这么近，总要互相照应一下。 ” 柳清歌像是再听他多说两句就又要吐血了，目光骇人。 沈清秋识时务地闭嘴 “ 走远 ” 了。剩下柳清歌一个人，艰难地又吐了一口血。 他二人素来不睦，年少时柳清歌就十分看不惯沈清秋为人，双方都厌恶彼此至极。 这种厌恶可不是欢喜冤家那种打打闹闹，而是真的一言不合大打出手、要对方性命的那 种。沈清秋不落井下石就是旭日西升，帮他救他？！ 可事实摆在眼前，不由得柳清歌脸不扭曲。 他的记忆只到练功失控前的一刻。可现在他灵息平顺，绝不可能是狂乱中自己打通理顺的 ，必然有外力相助。 难道，真是沈清秋帮了自己？ 一想到真有这种可能性，柳清歌就感觉一阵恶心，生不如死。,"CHAPTER 9: BAI ZHAN PEAK LORD Ling Xi Caves was labyrinthine, with thousands of twists and turns, like its entrance led to a world from an alien universe altogether; there was neither wind nor moon, yet it was cool and quiet. With white stones like clouds and green stones like jade, together they created the many wondrous yet natural stone beds. In the center was a pool of clear water like a mirror, reflecting a different world. The one thing marring the beauty was that some senior who’d previously secluded themselves here hadn’t known to cherish this public facility: the cave walls were covered in countless gashes and gouges made by both blade and sword energy; stone walls were plastered with swathes of dried blood; the stains already blackened. This was only one cavern of many, and though it looked a little like a murder scene, Shen Qingqiu was very satisfied, and didn’t intend to find another location. He sat on the stone bed and began to cultivate, carefully following the methods he’d memorized from the manuals. Then, as if the heavens didn’t want him to try honestly earning B-points, he heard a strange sound. Panting. Someone’s labored painting. At the same time, he sensed a burst of almost-rampant spiritual energy. Alright. Shen Qingqiu knew what had happened. Ling Xi Caves was gigantic; of course he wouldn’t be the only person who’d applied for seclusion here; there was someone else here cultivating as well… and had entered qi deviation, currently at a critical juncture. I! Only! Wanted! To! Cultivate! In! Seclusion! And! Level! Up! Martially! That’s! All! Can this not happen! Can! This! Not! Shen Qingqiu quickly opened his eyes and decided to investigate. He followed that sound and the waves of spiritual energy, passing through the various twists and turns; the disturbances became larger and larger. At last, he arrived in another cavern. As soon as he entered, he saw a figure clothed in white facing away from him; a longsword was stabbed into rock, all the way to the hilt. Sword energy flew in every which direction, without any order or pattern. The smears of blood on the person in white made him seem like a victim, but hismovements made him seem like a crazed murderer. This person’s qi deviation was pretty horrifying! Shen Qingqiu mulled it over: with his half-assed knowledge, if he went to smooth that person’s spiritual circulation, it was hard to say whether it’d be more likely to be help, or cause further damage. It was then he caught sight of that sword. With its master’s spiritual energy now out of control, the sword shook unceasingly, pulling itself free inch by inch, all while emitting an ear-piercing shriek. Silver light ran down the hilt’s engraved incantations and paired phoenix ornamentation, streaming without pause. Shen Qingqiu only needed a single glance to recognize which sword it was, whose sword it was. Fuck! Of all people, he had to meet this guy! If before he’d still wanted to help, now all he wanted was to flee for his life. But it was already too late. The person in white swung his head around, having already detected his presence! Shen Qingqiu was in no mood to praise, “What a beautiful man!” No matter how beautiful the man, if he glared at you with crimson eyes and bulging veins, you’d scramble to kneel, okay! He ran with a flick of his sleeves, but the man slapped the stone wall and sent rubble flying; the longsword, finally free of the cracked rock, soared through the air to stop before Shen Qingqiu’s eyes, blocking his path. He barely managed to brake in time, had he been running a little faster he would have been beheaded. Next instant, the white-clad man rushed him, devoid of reason. Shen Qingqiu knew it was too late to run, and could only steel himself to fight head on. He drew spiritual energy into his right hand. Staking everything, he struck at the other’s chest. If this person really was how the rumors painted him, with martial prowess on par with the protagonist, the hit would be damn useless. Not only damn useless, it might even send Shen Qingqiu flying 10 meters back, coughing up a mouthful of fresh blood, or something. However, it wasn’t useless, and the one sent flying three feet back while coughing up blood, was not Shen Qingqiu, but the other party! At that moment, Shen Qingqiu raised his right hand while looking at the person he’d knocked flat, and thought that, even without acting cool, he was already this awesome 48 !In truth, even though those who entered qi deviation were terrifying when berserk, they were also very fragile. Supported by a single thread, a single lucky strike could crumple them completely. With a conflicted expression, Shen Qingqiu watched that person half- kneel in pain, straining to rise and rip into him, only to collapse back onto one knee, and at last he sighed and moved closer, placing a hand on the other’s back. “I’ll say this first.” Shen Qingqiu didn’t concern himself with whether the other could understand him, saying for himself, “If I don’t save you now, it’ll be too late. I’m not familiar with how this works, so if I… ah, anyhow, I’ll have tried my best, so don’t blame me.” After who knows how long, Shen Qingqiu felt the other’s spiritual circulation gradually even out and return to normal; he slowly stopped worrying and withdrew his palm. All that remained was to pray that his slapdash, desperate attempt at helping hadn’t hurt the other’s cultivation. The one he’d magically managed to save only stayed with his head lowered, still not yet conscious. To be honest, Shen Qingqiu had already guessed this person’s identity, but the System’s notification gave absolute confirmation. Congratulations! System notification: The scene “Liu Qingge’s death” has been changed, the villain Shen Qingqiu’s grave-digging and hatefulness values have decreased, +200 B-points! As expected. This was his shidi from the same sect. Also, a sucker done in by the original Shen Qingqiu. Cang Qiong Mountain’s Twelve Peaks’ Bai Zhan Peak Lord, Liu Qingge. Liu Qingge, was a character who personified awesomeness.1 The twelve peaks of Cang Qiong Mountain each had their own long histories and distinctive characteristics. For example, the head Qiong Ding Peak coordinated the big picture and oversaw the entire group; Shen Qingqiu’s Qing Jing Peak was the favorite of scholars and young artists; Wan Jian Peak, with their perfect environment, had produced legions of master swordsmen since time immemorial; Ku Xing Peak’s name spoke for itself, even if you whipped Shen Qingqiu he still wouldn’t want to go; Xian Shu Peak was a drool-worthy existence. That’s because this last peak only accepted female disciples, with strict standards for their disciples’ attractiveness, and so was filled to the brim with beautiful girls. There’d been no shortage of self-indulgent, racy fan works, mass-blossoming freely, all written by sleazy 49 readers. Of these, A TyrannicalXian Shu Fell In Love With Me, My Days Sleeping Around in Xian Shu Peak had been particularly outstanding, filled with grade-school level writing and erotic scenes with no bottom line; their circulation and impact had been enormous, to the point they wouldn’t lose to the original work. But out of all the peaks, the one youths loved the most, revered the most, were the wildest about entering, was definitely Liu Qingge’s Bai Zhan Peak! This was the most militant of Cang Qiong Mountain’s branches, as well the branch with the greatest martial ability. Of the successive generations of Bai Zhan Peak Lords, every single one had been a world-class sword master, a victor of countless battles, an undefeated legend; how hot-blooded, badass! Male readers always fervently admire the strong; even though Liu Qingge never officially debuted, he didn’t lack for fans, and Shen Yuan had been especially fascinated with him. In his headcanon, Liu Qingge had been a sharp- looking manly man, powerful and magnificent. A war god, right! Shen Qingqiu looked down at that face, beautiful like a fine woman’s, and his dreams shattered and died. The fantasies he’d always held, destroyed. The invincible Bai Zhan Peak Lord, what’s with this complete mismatch, this was clearly the face of a youthful young master who arranged flowers and plucked willows 50 ! With this sort of appearance, you’ve totally failed the headcanons of that power-level-loving fanbase of yours! But thinking about it, it made sense. Liu Qingge was the older brother of the number one true female lead, the peerless beauty Liu Mingyan. As the protagonist’s wife, her substance absolutely had to be first-class. For her to have such powerful genes, was scientific! Undefeatable in battle, an arrogant disposition, and an attractive face. With Bing-ge around, a second such character was unnecessary. No wonder “Great Master” Airplane had offed him so early. Not the protagonist, yet you dare have such qualities? Within seconds, you’d be either exceptional cannon fodder or just dead! He hadn’t considered it then, but thinking about it now, would saving this person affect Luo Binghe’s satisfaction points? Few details existed on Liu Qingge, but he played a very important role: to display the depths of Shen Qingqiu’s scumminess. Even though the Liu-Shen pair were sect siblings, they didn’t get along. This was the reason Shen Qingqiu tried to flee earlier. Already unable tosee eye to eye normally, to throw one of them into qi deviation was to ask him to either chase down and hack Shen Qingqiu to death, or like in the original work, have Shen Qingqiu cause his death instead. Though no one knew why their hatred ran so deep, the original Shen Qingqiu had been Liu Qingge’s murderer, this was a sure fact. This incident being exposed was (one of) the thing(s) marking the start of Shen Qingqiu’s downfall. When condemning Shen Qingqiu, they’d said, “Taking advantage of an opening during cultivation, he intervened, driving the other to his death,” so this was likely when he’d made his move. Shen Qingqiu had killed the female lead’s only family, so of course Luo Binghe would take revenge for his wife. Shen Qingqiu’s depths as a hate sink were truly extraordinary! While Shen Qingqiu was there worrying over his future, Liu Qingge had finished coughing up blood, and finally regained consciousness. As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw Shen Qingqiu sitting before him with a bored expression, looking down on him with a stuck-up manner. It definitely didn’t look like someone with good intentions; alarmed, he violently jerked upright to try and defend himself. The motion jarred his badly-injured internal organs, throwing his qi circulation into chaos; another mouthful of blood sprayed out. Shen Qingqiu coolly said, “Shidi, regulate your qi, don’t be so agitated. You’re the Bai Zhan Peak Lord, how could you let yourself look so wretched? Here! Wipe yourself off.” He passed him a handkerchief. Liu Qingge coughed up blood while saying, “Shen… What the hell are you planning now…” Seeing how much he was suffering, Shen Qingqiu lightly clapped him on the back. Liu Qingge originally thought the other wanted to harm him, but was helpless to avoid it. Only after the palm touched him, did he feel a clear, steady stream of spiritual energy enter and flow through his body, helping to smooth his circulation. Liu Qingge was more aghast than he’d have been if Shen Qingqiu had backstabbed him. After all, he was used to the backstabbing. Shen Qingqiu continued to pat his back, while saying earnestly, “Liu- shidi, to tell the truth, lately Shixiong has been in seclusion, and has come to realize many things. Seeing you at death’s door, in danger of dying a beauty’s dea 51 ahem, dying so young, it brought back a lot of memories; Shixiong isdeeply ashamed and filled with regret.” Liu Qingge seemed to hack up blood even more profusely. Shen Qingqiu tactfully expressed his goodwill. “How about, you and I, from here on out, leave behind our disagreements, and move forward hand-in- hand as a pair of model sect siblings, full of affection between fellow sect members? How do you feel about this, Shidi?” Saying it so straightforwardly was a little shameful, but since he already didn’t kill Liu Qingge, having changed the scene and its evil karma, why not go all the way and simply build a good relationship? Maybe Master Liu could even become his backup? Liu Qingge’s complexion was abnormally poor. He looked Shen Qingqiu in the eyes for a while, then as if he’d finally reached the limits of his tolerance, said, “You, go further away.” Shen Qingqiu expressed his understanding. After all, they’d hated each other for so long. Good feelings couldn’t be fostered in such a short amount of time; he couldn’t rush this sort of thing, only take it slow. He nodded, and went as asked, waving behind him without looking back as he walked. “If Shidi runs into more trouble during training, there’s no need to be shy; you can call Shixiong over for help. Since we’re so close, we should take care of each other.” Liu Qingge looked like he would cough up blood again if Shen Qingqiu spoke anymore. His glare was terrifying. Shen Qingqiu wisely shut his mouth and “went further away.” Liu Qingge was left alone, and painfully hacked up another mouthful of blood. They’d always been at odds. Ever since he was young, Liu Qingge could never stand Shen Qingqiu; both parties deeply despised each other. This type of vitriol, wasn’t the type you’d see when a belligerent but happy couple fought and argued, but the type where both parties couldn’t last a single sentence without escalating into violence, to the point of trying to kill each other. The fact that Shen Qingqiu hadn’t kicked him while he was down was already inconceivable, but to even help him or save him? But reality was right before him; Liu Qingge’s face couldn’t help twisting. He only remembered up to the moment he lost control. But now his spiritual circulation was smooth; he couldn’t have straightened it himself during his frenzy. There must have been outside assistance. Could it really be, that Shen Qingqiu had helped him?Just thinking about this possibility filled Liu Qingge with revulsion; he’d rather have died."
虽然被辛苦救回来的人恶心了，沈清秋却无比圆满。 原本应该死于他手的柳清歌，却被他阴差阳错救活了。 如果能跟这个人交好，就算养成十佳好徒儿洛冰河的计划不成功，柳清歌作为百战峰主人 ，起码能看在同门的面子上帮他挡挡！ 有点功利主义，不过老命面前，枉谈节气啊 …… 洞中无日月。沈清秋压根没觉得自己干了些啥，就刷的到了从灵犀洞出关的日子。 沈清秋闭目盘坐在石台上，等到最后一丝灵息游走完四肢百骸，才睁开双眼。 潜心修习数月之久，他已经能将灵力收发自如，而且在原有基础上更上一层楼。这个状态 ，宣告着这具身体的掌控权，已经百分之百属于他，连最后一丝不协调也告于湮灭。双目 光采湛湛，已与过往的神形有所不同。 沈清秋从石台上跃下，身躯越发轻盈，四肢如灌清风，老轻老有劲儿了。 当然，这也极有可能只是他自己的主观感受。毕竟闭关的日子简直快得就像拉动了视频的 进度条，如果是小说，不像飞机菊苣那样注水的话一章就写完了。 临走之前，他觉得应该和隔壁打个招呼，便敲了敲石壁。 沈清秋： “ 师弟你那边情况如何？师兄我且先出去了。 ” 他声音在空旷的洞穴里回荡着，并不大，但足够柳清歌这种修为的人听清了。 那头果然没什么回应，沈清秋也不在意，表达了他的心意（？）就行，当下一甩衣摆，脚 底生风地出洞去、迎接即将到来的一场暴风雨。 算算时日，差不多就是这段时间了，接下来要发生的剧情，非常重要，算是《狂傲仙魔 途》前期的第一个小 □□ 。 魔族上门挑衅，引发的一场大骚乱。 而本书的两位重要女主角，也将在这场小 □□ 里惊鸿一现，并且开始注意到洛冰河。 灵犀洞与外界隔绝，洞中清静，然而甫一出洞，整座穹顶峰仿佛烽火狼烟四起，四处都是 慌乱奔走的弟子们，告警的钟声响成一片。 沈清秋立刻明白，已经上山来了！ 真来得早不如来得巧，刚好踩着点子赶上了。 几名不知是谁门下的弟子一看到他就扑了过来： “ 沈师伯！沈师伯你可算出关了！大事不 好，魔界妖人混进穹顶峰上来了，打伤了我们不少师兄弟！ ” 沈清秋一手摸一个： “ 安定。掌门师兄呢？ ” 弟子 A 哭诉道： “ 掌门师伯下山外出有要事。若非如此，魔族妖人哪能趁机攻上来！ ” 弟子 B 愤愤道： “ 魔族妖人真是卑鄙！不光趁虚而入，还把连接十二峰之间的虹桥都打断 了，还布了奇怪的结界，穹顶峰现在根本无法得到别的峰脉的支援！ ” 这些沈清秋都知道，刚才也就走走过场问问而已。现在的他经过修炼，又有了拳打洛冰河 脚踢柳清歌的经验（ …… ），豪气冲云天道： “ 无需惊慌。我苍穹山泱泱大派，英杰辈出 ，害怕这几个魔界余孽不成！ ” 弟子们顿时觉得找到了主心骨，开火车一般跟在了沈清秋后面。沿路走，原本无头苍蝇一 样乱撞的也连忙跟上，不知道出了什么事的也都跟上，到最后一条队伍越排越长，直到来 到穹顶殿大殿之前。 但凡在穹顶峰上的苍穹山门人，都前来围剿深入腹地的魔族了。清静峰一脉的弟子因为剧 情需要， “ 恰巧 ” 都在穹顶峰来迎接出关的沈清秋，早聚集于此。沈清秋第一眼就是去寻找 洛冰河的身影，见到他果然站在人群之中，神情肃然。 一段时日不见，长高了不少，少年人的身形如秀挺的拔节竹子，那小脸蛋又俊俏，甚是引 人注目。见主角已经到场，沈清秋安下了心，才把注意力转移到敌方身上。 古朴大气的穹顶殿前，群聚着百多名魔气滚滚的异族。而这场入侵的领导者，居然是一名 看上去不过十五六岁的少女。 沈清秋心里小小激动了一下：出来了！终于出来了！ 就算在爱好奇装异服的魔族群众里，这名少女的造型也非主流得很。满头乌黑的长发梳成 数条小辫子，肤色白皙，眼妆浓艳，嘴唇鲜红异常，年纪虽小，却已能看出日后美艳逼人 的风姿。大热天的穿得甚是清凉，几乎就是几条红色的纱幔围在身上，手腕脚腕都带着银 色的环饰，满身的小铃铛随着她轻微的动作叮当作响。 她雪白的赤足直接踏在地面上。沈清秋忍不住斜眼多窥探了两眼。 倒不是处于耍流氓的心态，而是 …… 不远万里从魔界跋山涉水来到这里还赤脚爬了这么高 的山，姑娘你 …… 你脚真的不痛吗？ 不对。重点不是这个！ 重点是，这，就是《狂傲仙魔途》这本书中，人气最高的女主角（之一）  魔族圣女， 纱华铃。 纱华铃是纯血统的魔族子民，心狠手辣，刁钻娇蛮，却和洛冰河爱的死去活来，跟洛冰河 勾搭上后，别说为他杀人了，连背叛魔族这种大逆不道的事都敢做。 虽然这种无脑痴情的妹子现在挺遭人诟病的，但没办法，有更多男读者喜欢。可惜这么热 辣如火的妹子，非男主无福消受。沈清秋忍不住看了一眼洛冰河。刚好，洛冰河也无意之 间扫了过来，两人目光对上，顿时双双一怔。洛冰河欲言又止。沈清秋冲他点点头。 这个时刻，虹桥已断，各峰峰主睡觉的睡觉，闭关的闭关，逛街的逛街，出差的出差，沈 清秋这个长辈的到来，无疑是一记强力定心丸，弟子们顿时有了底气，明帆首先叫了出来 ：“ 妖女！我师傅已经到了，看你还敢嚣张！ ” 人越聚越多，几百名服色统一的弟子神情激愤，成包围之势把入侵者困在殿前。几名魔族 想趁机突围，刚好被沈清秋拿来练手，随手一拿，就把他们提起，扔回了纱华铃脚下。 纱华铃一向聪明机敏，刚才嚣张，是因为欺负苍穹山做久了第一派，守备闲散疏松，又瞅 准岳清源赴外公干，穹顶峰上没有长辈镇场，现在一发觉讨不到好，她立刻改口： “ 此次 我族上山，原本就不是为了争斗。只是久闻中原苍穹山人才辈出，心中好奇，想上山切磋 一番，探个究竟。 ” 沈清秋摇扇道： “ 好说好说。但既然是想切磋一番，又为何要趁掌门不在之时来切磋？为 何要隔断虹桥？又为何要打伤我派众多弟子？没见过这么个切磋法。 ” 纱华铃咬了咬唇，动用了独属于少女的武器。她撩起了一缕垂落在脸颊前的散发，曼声道 ：“ 这位必定就是名动天下的 ‘ 修雅剑 ’ 沈清秋沈前辈了，果然百闻不如一见。铃儿年轻， 未能好好驾驭属下，若有得罪误会，还请仙师海涵。 ” 任她再闻言软语，沈清秋也不会有半点动心。其中来龙去脉，没人比他更清楚了。 说穿了，这一闹，其实就是因为纱华铃刚刚被封了一个魔族圣女。心高气傲的她不知天高 地厚，想一举杀入苍穹山第一峰，夺取穹顶殿的题字作为战利品，回魔族邀功。同时向人 界示威。 沈清秋道： “ 那现在姑娘可有所结论？ ” 纱华铃抿嘴笑道： “ 虽然现在我族处于弱势，那也只是因为贵派人多势众嘛。铃儿不敢断 然下结论。 ” 沈清秋摆长辈架子摆得如鱼得水，道： “ 哦？那你要怎样才能下结论？ ” 纱华铃轻启朱唇，说出了一个看似公平正义的方法。 “ 不如我们各自挑选三名代表，进行三场比试。 ” 这方法，挺好的。毕竟现在人界和魔族已经勉强平衡多年没撕破脸皮，如果贸然一锅端了 纱华铃和她手下这堆乌合之众，不是不行，只是容易变成 □□ ，魔族定然不会让她白白被 端，如此挑起更大的争端，似乎不值。干脆放他们走，又太憋屈，总不能让这群异族在穹 顶峰来去自如。划个道儿，比一比，教训一顿对方，双方各退一步留点面子，似乎是最好 的处理方式。 原作中这一段因为是个小 □□ ，沈清秋记得还算清楚。 第一场，沈清秋 VS 魔族独臂长老。为了突显沈清秋的人渣特质，他当然必须用卑鄙的下 作手段获胜。再对比之后第三场洛冰河光明磊落的行为，可以让读者产生强烈的反差。 而在这里，沈清秋可不会就那么白白诋毁自己的形象。 独臂长老一身紫黑色调，沉默木讷，听了纱华铃的指令，走到前方的一片空地来。 本门弟子都在为沈师伯呐喊助威。沈清秋知道这位独臂长老有几斤几两，微笑道： “ 你只 有一只手臂，这样就算我赢了你，也是胜之不武。 ” 纱华铃掩嘴道： “ 哦？铃儿倒有个法子，我看不如 …… 仙师也自断一臂？那这样就不算胜 之不武啦！ ” 场下怒声四起。沈清秋不以为意，微微一笑，缓缓把折扇展开： “ 一只手都不用，如何？ ”,"CHAPTER 10: DEMON GIRL’S PROVOCATION Even though the person he’d worked so hard to save had treated him as disgusting, Shen Qingqiu was incomparably satisfied. Liu Qingge, who should have died by his hand, had been saved by him in a freak accident 52 . If he could become friendly with this person, even if his plan to raise Luo Binghe into a top ten best disciple didn’t succeed, as the Bai Zhan Peak Lord, Liu Qingge could at least stand before him as a fellow sect sibling and help shield him a little! Although this was a little utilitarian, as his own sorry life was on the line, it was all pointless discussion 53 … There was no sense of time within the caves. Shen Qingqiu felt like he hadn’t done anything at all, when the day to exit his seclusion in Ling Xi Caves arrived. Shen Qingqiu sat cross-legged, eyes shut on a stone platform, and waited until the last shred of spiritual energy had finished circulating through all his limbs and bones, before opening his eyes. Having intensively cultivated for months, he could already control his spiritual energy freely, and had risen one level above his original cultivation base. This state proclaimed that he’d already obtained one hundred percent command over this body; even the last shred of bad coordination had been annihilated. Both of his eyes shone brightly, and his immortal figure was different from how it had been in the past. Shen Qingqiu jumped down from the stone platform, his body all the more lithe; as if his four limbs were instilled with a breeze, filled with vigor. Of course, it was possible this was only his subjective feeling. After all, the days in seclusion had passed by so quickly, as if a video progress bar had been dragged; if this were a novel, and not padded like that of “Great Master” Airplane’s, the writing would have been finished in one chapter. Before leaving, he thought he ought to greet his neighbor, and so knocked on the stone wall. Shen Qingqiu: “Shidi, how is your situation over there? Shixiong will be leaving first.” His voice echoed inside the empty cavern; it wasn’t loud, but enough for a cultivator like Liu Qingge to hear clearly.As expected, there came no response; Shen Qingqiu also didn’t mind; expressing his kind wishes was enough; with a sweep of his hem, he immediately exited the caves like the wind was beneath his feet, to welcome the approaching storm. Calculating the time and date, it was about time for that: the upcoming story event was very important, and could be considered early Proud Immortal Demon Way’s first small climax. The demons arriving to provoke them, triggering a huge disturbance. And two important female leads in the book, would also show a brief glimpse of themselves during this small climax, and start paying attention to Luo Binghe. Ling Xi Caves was isolated from the outside world; inside the cave was tranquil, but as soon as he exited, the entire Qiong Ding Peak seemed to be filled with the fire and smoke of war; panicked disciples were running around everywhere, and the alarm bells were ringing as one. Shen Qingqiu immediately understood: they’d already arrived! Perfect timing;3 he’d just happened to make it in time. As soon as they saw him, several disciples from some unknown peak threw themselves at him. “Shen-shibo! Shen-shibo you’ve finally left seclusion! It’s a disaster; monsters from the Demon Realm snuck into Qiong Ding Peak, and injured quite a few of our sect siblings!” Shen Qingqiu patted a disciple with each hand. “Settle down. Where is Zhangmen-shixiong?” Disciple A said tearfully, “Zhangmen-shibo left the mountain for something. Otherwise, how could the monsters from the demon race use this chance and invade us!” Disciple B said furiously, “The monsters from the demon race are truly despicable! Not only did they take advantage of our weakness to invade, they also severed all the Rainbow Bridges connecting the Twelve Peaks, and set up some strange barrier, so right now Qiong Ding Peak is completely unable to receive support from the other peaks!” Shen Qingqiu knew all of these, and was just asking while passing through. The current him had gone through cultivation training, and on top of that had experiences of punching Luo Binghe and kicking Liu Qingge (…); with a heroic spirit that reached the heavens, he said, “No need to panic. Our Cang Qiong Mountain as a sect is majestic and unparalleled, and has produced great numbers of heroes; we would never fear these dregs from the Demon Realm!”The disciples immediately felt like they’d found their pillar of support, and followed behind Shen Qingqiu like a train. Along the way, the ones who’d originally been flailing around like headless flies also rushed to follow, and the ones who didn’t know what had happened followed as well; in the end, the procession kept growing longer and longer, until they arrived before Qiong Ding Peak’s main hall. Every single Cang Qiong Mountain Sect member on Qiong Ding Peak had come forward to encircle and exterminate the demons that had entered deep within. Due to plot requirements, the disciples from Qing Jing Peak were all “coincidentally” at Qiong Ding Peak to greet Shen Qingqiu as he left seclusion, and had been gathered here since earlier. Shen Qingqiu’s first glance sought out Luo Binghe’s form, and indeed he saw him standing within the group, expression solemn. It had been some time since he’d last seen him; he’d grown taller by a fair amount, his youthful figure like a graceful, elongating stalk of bamboo; along with that handsome little face, he drew much attention. Seeing that the protagonist was at the scene, Shen Qingqiu’s heart settled down, and he turned his focus to the enemy. Before the elegant and magnificent Qiong Ding Hall, gathered more than a hundred members of a foreign people, roiling with demonic qi. And the leader of this invasion, was actually a young girl who appeared no more than fifteen or sixteen. Shen Qingqiu’s heart became a little excited: she’s appeared! She’s finally appeared! Demons loved exotic and unusual dress, but even among them, this girl’s design was exceptionally unorthodox. Her jet-black head of hair had been combed into many small braids; her complexion was fair, her eye make-up bold, her lips abnormally scarlet; although she was young, the glamorous and threatening bearing she would have in the future was apparent. As it was a hot day, she dressed coolly, having practically just wrapped several red, gauzy bolts of cloth around herself; her wrists and ankles were decorated with silver bangles, the tiny bells all over her body jingling with her slight movements. Her bare, snow-white feet directly touched the ground. Shen Qingqiu could not help side-eyeing, peeping at them twice more. It wasn’t due to an indecent mindset, but rather… you’ve traveled thousands of miles from the Demon Realm, crossing over land and sea; after arriving, you even climbed such a tall mountain barefoot, young miss, do… doyour feet really not hurt? No. This wasn’t the main point! The main point was, this was (one of) the most popular female lead(s) in the novel of Proud Immortal Demon Way Demon Saint Sha Hualing 54 . Sha Hualing was a pureblooded demon, vicious and merciless, crafty and proud, yet madly in love with Luo Binghe; after getting involved with Luo Binghe, not only did she kill for him, she even dared do a disgraceful thing like betraying the demons. Though this type of brainless, lovesick girl was often denounced now, there was nothing to be done: an even larger number of male readers liked it. A pity such an exciting 55 girl could only be enjoyed by the male lead. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help glancing at Luo Binghe. At the same time, Luo Binghe also inadvertently swept his gaze over; their two gazes met, and both of them immediately startled. Luo Binghe was about to speak, but said nothing. Shen Qingqiu rushed to nod. At this time, the Rainbow Bridges had been severed, so for the Peak Lords of the various peaks, the ones sleeping kept sleeping, the ones in seclusion remained in seclusion, the ones strolling around kept strolling, the ones away on official business remained away; so Shen Qingqiu’s arrival, being a member of the older generation, was undoubtedly a powerful calming agent; the disciples immediately gained confidence; Ming Fan was the first to yell, “Demoness! My master is here now, let’s see if you dare be so arrogant!” More and more people gathered; several hundred disciples in robes of the same color, with furious expressions surrounded the invaders, trapping them within the hall. Several demons wanted to use the chance to break through, perfect for Shen Qingqiu to use as training; he casually grabbed them, lifted them up and threw them back to Sha Hualing’s feet. Sha Hualing had always been clever and resourceful; her arrogance before was because Cang Qiong Mountain Sect’s defenses, due to having long been the number one sect, were lax and loose, plus she’d seen that Yue Qingyuan was out on official business, leaving Qiong Ding Peak without one of the older generation to guard it; now sensing that things weren’t good, she immediately changed her tune. “My people’s ascending the mountain this time, was never for the sake of battle. It was just that we’ve long heard that Cang Qiong Mountain produces great numbers of talent, so we were curious, and wanted to ascend the mountain to exchange pointers and investigate.” Shen Qingqiu waved his fan while saying, “How kind of you. But sinceit’s to exchange pointers, why come when the Sect Leader is away to do it? Why severe the Rainbow Bridges? And why injure so many of our sect’s disciples? I’ve never seen this method of exchanging pointers.” Sha Hualing bit her lip, and utilized that weapon exclusive to young girls. She lifted a stray hair from before her cheek, and slowly said, “This must be the one whose name moves the world, the ‘Xiu Ya Sword,’ Senior Shen Qingqiu; as expected, hearsay cannot compare to seeing the real person. Ling-er is young, and unable to manage her subordinates properly, if we have offended you or caused misunderstandings, we beg this immortal master to be magnanimous and forgiving.” No matter how softly she spoke, Shen Qingqiu still wouldn’t be moved the slightest bit. No one was clearer than him about what was behind this situation. To say how it really was, this trouble had happened because Sha Hualing had just been granted the title of a Demon Saint. Being proud and arrogant, she had an exaggerated opinion of her own abilities, and wanted to slaughter into Cang Qiong Mountain’s first peak in one go, seize Qiong Ding Hall’s inscription as a trophy of war, and bring it back as proof of her achievement. At the same time, it would be a demonstration of force towards the Human Realm. Shen Qingqiu said, “Then what is young miss’s conclusion now?” Sha Hualing pursed her lips while smiling and said, “Though right now my people are at a disadvantage, that is also only because your sect has great numbers. Ling-er is unable to arrive at a definite conclusion.” Shen Qingqiu put on the airs of an elder as smoothly as a fish took to water, and said, “Oh? Then what do you need to arrive at a conclusion?” Sha Hualing parted her red lips, and elegantly spoke a method that seemed fair and just. “Why don’t we each choose three representatives, and hold three matches.” This method was rather good. After all, currently the Human Realm and demon race had maintained an uneasy balance for many years, and had yet to drop pretenses; hastily wiping out Sha Hualing and her mob wasn’t impossible, but would easily light a fuse: the demons would definitely not let her be wiped out in vain, and would stir up an even greater conflict; it wasn’t worth it. Simply letting them go would also generate too many grievances: they couldn’t allow a foreign people to come and go as they pleased in Qiong Ding Peak. By setting up conditions and holding some matches, teaching the other party a lesson, both parties could back down and save some face; that was the best way to handlethis. Since this was a small climax in the original work, Shen Qingqiu still remembered it fairly clearly. The first match, Shen Qingqiu versus the demon Elder Dubi 56 . To highlight Shen Qingqiu’s scummy nature, he of course had needed to use despicable and underhanded means to achieve victory. By comparing it with Luo Binghe’s honourable and upright actions in the third match afterwards, a strong contrast would be generated for the readers. And here, Shen Qingqiu was not going to tarnish his own image so pointlessly. Elder Dubi’s entire body was a dark purple color; he was taciturn and reticent; upon hearing Sha Hualing’s command, he walked forwards to an area of open ground. The Sect’s disciples were all cheering and shouting for their Shen-shibo. Shen Qingqiu knew the extent of this Elder Dubi’s strength, and said while smiling, “You only have one arm; even if I defeat you like this, it’d be due to an unfair advantage.” Sha Hualing said from behind her hand, “Oh? Actually, Ling-er has a method, how about… this immortal master also severe an arm? That way there won’t be an unfair advantage anymore!” Angry voices rose around them. Shen Qingqiu was unconcerned, smiled slightly, and slowly spread his fan. “I won’t even use a single hand, how about that?”"
此言一出，一片哗然。洛冰河在人群之中，也愣住了。 一只手都不用？ 纱华铃哼了一声，认为沈清秋这是在托大，但又窃喜不止。能这么轻轻松松胜下一场，何 乐而不为？她急忙道： “ 既然沈前辈都这么说了，那便开始吧！ ” 旁人有不少觉得此女未免脸皮甚厚，虽姿态天真烂漫，言语之间却毒辣阴险，还上赶着占 人家便宜。沈清秋看书时作为看戏的读者是一种感受，现在作为局内人，又是另一种感受 ，还好他本来就吃不消纱华铃的处事风格，不过看在她年纪尚小，人又娇美的份上，勉强 可以当做是萝莉任性的可爱。 诸多注视之中，沈清秋果然依言没有拔出佩剑，而是把玩着手中折扇，对独臂长老微微一 笑。 独臂长老只有一臂，但抡起鬼头刀来却丝毫不受影响。而他这虎虎生风的一刀，居然没砍 中目标。他一个回头，沈清秋已经站到了另一个方位，继续笑，笑得脸酸。 然而，修雅剑已经出鞘。沈清秋并没有直接用手触碰剑身，只是左手暗暗捏着一个剑诀， 操纵着修雅剑翻飞挥舞。独臂长老被雪亮的剑光闪得眼睛疼，忙提刀再上！ 刀剑相击，顿时叮当之声不绝于耳，火花飞溅炫舞。 众人看得目不转睛。实在是这一场比试，可谓好看又 “ 好看 ” 。前一个好看是指打得给力， 真刀对真枪，生死攸关。后一个好看，则是指视觉效果华丽。尤其是沈清秋，游刃有余， 书香清气间刀光剑影飞驰，还能气度从容纸扇轻摇，似乎随时能七步之间吟诗一首，这做 派，怎一个惊艳了得！  不对，这 B 装的，到家了！ 洛冰河看得几乎心驰神荡。他知道沈清秋厉害，却没料到，厉害到这个地步。 好强！ 在本门弟子的欢呼声中，沈清秋拿下了第一场比试的完胜。 这一刻，沈清秋有点能体会原装货不装 B 会死的心情了。 因为真的是太爽了！ 众弟子们崇敬的目光连成一片星星闪闪，沈清秋觉得自己的经历何其励志！ 人渣反派也可以刷威望值！ 同时，系统也传来喜讯： 【魔攻仙山，比斗第一场，沈清秋胜，武力值 +50 。 B 格 +50 。】 沈清秋欣慰的笑容没有维持多久，系统的下一个消息就给了他一巴掌。 【预警提示：如洛冰河未参与比斗，主角爽度将扣除 1000. 】 “ 啥？！ ” 毫无心理准备的沈清秋，大惊失色。 他吭哧吭哧老牛拉破车一样攒了这么久的爽度，也不过才 300 多，这一下就扣 1000 多？！ 系统你杀人啦？！ 这场比试，是至关重要的剧情。同时负担着前期小 □□ 、两位女主亮相争妍、收小弟、收 秘籍等重要作用。如果不能让洛冰河在这里出场，他就不能出风头，引起众人注意，爽度 > 可是如果让他作为本派代表之一出战，那沈清秋这做的算是什么事啊？ 原装货能够把洛冰河推上场，是因为他不要脸！他置门派荣辱于不顾！他恨洛冰河入骨要 接魔族之手虐他！ 可现在，沈清秋这三点都不符合！ 说到底为什么堂堂主角的爽度一定要负担在别人身上！沈清秋尚在怒斥系统的不科学，第 二场比斗已即将开始。 纱华铃害怕沈清秋以一挑三，忙道： “ 如果三场都由一个人上，那么就没有切磋的意义。 我族派出的第二名比试者，就是我自己。 ” 她要上场，第一固然自信自己的实力，第二也是觉得沈清秋应该不会仗着前辈身份欺压后 辈。沈清秋表示根本不想理这点小心思，就算他本来有以一挑三刷武力值和威望的雄心壮 志，听到系统那一条通知也萎掉了。 不过第二场比试，也有个极富噱头的看点。 沈清秋道： “ 她的话你们都听到了。有谁愿意担此重任？ ” 他虽然是问所有的本门弟子，目光却落在了某一片区域。 那一片区域里站的全都是身姿婀娜的女弟子，毫无疑问，是仙姝峰的弟子们。在这一群一 个赛一个肤白貌美气质佳的仙姝峰 MM 们中间，有一个人格格不入地遮着面纱。 在沈清秋问出这一句后，这个人缓缓地站了出来。 沈清秋感到一阵难以自持的鸡冻。 来了！要来了！本书两大女主角之间的第一次 PK ！ 柳溟烟是个大美女。惊天地泣鬼神的大美女。就算是身在自古就美女辈出的仙姝峰，那也 是能鹤立鸡群的存在。 她的哥哥是百战峰的主人，她却因为年纪较小入门较晚，成为仙姝峰的下一代弟子。 因为相貌太过美丽，夺魂摄魄，不得不常年用面纱罩住脸庞，犹如一朵高岭之花，遥不可 攀。 总之，向天打飞机大大为了写这个角色的外貌，估计把自己从小学到高中学的所有褒义成 语都用上了，真是难为他了。 沈清秋很喜欢这个女主角，不光是因为柳溟烟美貌值最高的原因。也因为此女颇为大气， 识大体，懂大局，行事也公正磊落，是洛冰河庞大后宫中，难得有智商也有人品的老婆。 还有一点。柳溟烟是唯一一个，向天打飞机笔下没有详细描写被推倒过程的女角色。虽然 这一安排使得许多读者大大不满，甚至盖高楼狂喷，但也使得柳溟烟多了别的女主所没有 的东西：冰清玉洁的色彩！ 没办法，得不到的总是最好的  ( ￣  ￣ ”)  这一战的看点就在于此。有魔教妖女，自然要有正道圣女。每个男人都有一个被天使和恶 魔夹在中间左右为难的梦。看她们前一刻还为自己争风吃醋，下一刻又为自己出生入死， 是雄性生物至高无上的 YY 圣典桥段。邪恶妖女身上狂野放浪的魅力能让他们如痴如醉， 纯洁圣女欲拒还迎的禁欲感，又何尝不让人心内瘙痒呢！ 不得不说，飞机菊苣真的很会抓人的爽点！沈清秋忍不住又看了洛冰河一眼。 洛冰河被他看得难以不在乎。 不知道沈清秋究竟为什么一直要这么留意他？难道师尊真这么 …… 在意自己？ 可惜，在向天打飞机菊苣的笔下，女角色之间的打斗，除非为男人撕【哔  】，否则一 般没什么精彩看点  呃不，其实想想，他笔下任何打斗都没啥看点，因为来来去去就是 用哪几个词，什么 “ 白光一闪 ”“ 七色长虹 ”“ 五彩剑气 ”“ 恐怖如斯 ” 。 几柱香之后，柳溟烟落败。毕竟这时她还没有去万剑峰找到自己的剑，虽然尽力，奈何武 器只是一把普通细剑，而纱华铃已经是魔教圣女，圣器挂得满身都是，两人实力自然尚有 差距。 柳溟烟走到沈清秋前， “ 弟子落败。有辱使命，请沈师伯责罚。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 在旁人不出时站出，你有这份责任担当，已是不易，胜败如得失，常态而已 ，无须在意，日后赢回来就是。 ” 纱华铃扳回一局，容光焕发，娇笑道： “ 这第三场，就是定胜负的一局啦！不知道沈前辈 又要派哪一位上场呢？这次可要小心挑选呢。 ” 沈清秋负手而立，意味深长道： “ 不劳姑娘费心。沈某早有人选，而且沈某可以保证，无 论是输是赢，此人都会是你命中的克星。 ” 纱华铃只当是他危言耸听，拍了拍手掌，道： “ 哪位勇士第三场上场？ ” 魔族众中，缓步走出了一名巨型长老。 说是巨型，实在是因为他太高了。 绝壁超过一丈了有木有！ 虎背熊腰，蓬头散发，浑身上下披满带刺的铠甲，拖着一柄精铁大锤。每走一步，沈清秋 都感觉地面似乎有轻微的震颤。 纱华铃得意道： “ 先给仙山的各位的提个醒，天锤长老的铠甲倒刺上涂满了剧毒，这种剧 毒对魔族无效，但人若被刺中，无药可解。 ” 这句话给沈清秋的第一感受是：尼玛向天打飞机菊苣，取名字不要太爽太省事！ 一只手臂的就叫独臂长老，武器是个大锤子，就叫天锤长老。敢不敢认真取个名字啊？！ 而在旁人之中，掀起的则是一阵激愤。 “ 臭妖女！比试就比试，使用剧毒，还有什么公平可言！ ” 纱华铃反驳道： “ 我可没有隐瞒这一点。若觉得不公平，或是害怕中毒身亡，放弃比试， 直接认输就不用比了。魔族也不会嘲笑人族，毕竟爱惜性命，人之常情。我族却是视荣誉 胜过一切的！ ” 魔族的哄笑和弟子们的谴责声中，沈清秋揉了揉眉心，无声叹息。 纱华铃这样的女人，在读者视角可以带入主角 YY 的时候，那自然是一万个喜欢，一万个 爽。可一旦真的成为她身边的人，他就不信还有人真喜欢的起来！ 倒不是因为和书中描述的有差距之类的，事实上，糟糕的就是：太还原了！ 凶狠毒辣的个性，再加上抛弃大脑的痴情，不是主角的人还是早点闪旁边去吧。一旦你威 胁到她自己或者是洛冰河的一丁点利益，她第一个要你的狗命，连剁手砍脚挖眼的机会都 没有，哪怕你是她亲爹都得小心点儿。原作中她为了扶持洛冰河在魔界上位，坑的不就是 自己的爹 …… 沈清秋对纱华铃的挑衅无动于衷，留了一段空白，作为给魔族众人制造压力的时间，最后 才回身，双目定定凝视着某人所在的方向。 “ 洛冰河，你，出来。 ”,"CHAPTER 11: BACKSTABBING THE MALE LEAD, NO. 2 As soon as these were said, everyone was in an uproar. Within the crowd, Luo Binghe also stood in shock. To not use a single hand? Sha Hualing snorted, thinking that this was Shen Qingqiu being full of himself, but was secretly filled with endless glee. That they could win a match this easily, why wouldn’t they go for it? She hurriedly said, “Since Senior Shen has already said so, let us start!” Quite a few bystanders thought that this girl’s face really was extremely thick; even though her manner was pure and innocent, her words were vicious and sinister, and she even rushed to take advantage of others. When reading, as a reader enjoying the drama, Shen Qingqiu had had one impression; now as an insider within the situation, he had another; luckily he’d never been able to tolerate Sha Hualing’s way of dealing with things, but having seen that she was young, and adding on her daintiness, he’d been able to force himself to regard it as a young girl’s cute willfulness. Under the gazes of many, Shen Qingqiu indeed followed his words and didn’t draw his sword, but played with the fan in his hand, smiling at Elder Dubi. Elder Dubi only had one arm, but it didn’t hinder him from swinging his Guitou Knife the slightest bit. But this savage swing of his, actually didn’t hit his target. He turned around, and Shen Qingqiu was already standing somewhere else, still smiling, to the point his face was sore. However, Xiu Ya had already left its sheath. Shen Qingqiu had not directly touched his sword at all: only his left hand had secretly formed a sword gesture, commanding Xiu Ya to fly and turn over, brandish itself. Elder Dubai’s eyes were in pain from the flashes of the sword’s snow-white gleam; he rushed to lift his knife and attacked again! Knife and sword clashed, and instantly ringing noises sounded incessantly, while sparks sprayed and danced. The crowd was unable to turn their eyes away. In reality, this was just a competition, but could even be said to be captivating, and “captivating.” The first captivating was due to how impressive the fight was, using real weapons, being a matter of life and death. The second captivating, referred to themagnificent effects. Especially Shen Qingqiu, moving skillfully and easily, with that pure and literary air, the glint and flash of blades streaking about, and he could still gracefully and leisurely wave his paper fan, as if at any instant, he could improvise a poem within seven steps 57 ; this style, how incredibly breathtaking! No, to be able to act cool to this level, was too perfect! Luo Binghe watched until his heart was practically galloping, his soul tremoring. He’d known Shen Qingqiu was incredible, but he’d never anticipated that he was this incredible. So strong! Surrounded by the cheers of the Sect’s disciples, Shen Qingqiu obtained a complete victory for the first match. At this moment, Shen Qingqiu could understand why the original goods’ had clung to acting cool, like it was his lifeline. Because it was really too gratifying! The crowd of disciples’ gazes formed a sea of sparkling stars; Shen Qingqiu felt, how inspiring this experience of his was! A scum villain could also gain reputation points! At the same time, the System also sent good news: Demonic invasion of immortals’ mountain, first match of the competition, Shen Qingqiu’s victory, martial ability points +50. B-points +50. Shen Qingqiu’s pleased smile hadn’t lasted very long, when the System’s next news gave him a slap. System alert: If Luo Binghe does not participate in the competition, the protagonist’s satisfaction points will be deducted by 1000. “What?” The completely unprepared Shen Qingqiu turned pale with shock. The satisfaction points he’d earned, huffing and puffing like an old ox dragging a broken cart, were only in the three hundreds, and in an instant he’d be deducted 1000? System, you trying to kill people? This competition was an important part of the plot. At the same time it also was responsible for being a small, early stage climax, debuting two female leads and pitting their splendor against each other, getting an underling, getting a secret technique, important things like that. If Luo Binghe could not make it on stage here, he would miss the limelight and be unable to grab everyone’s attention, so satisfaction points -1000. But if Shen Qingqiu made him a Sect representative and sent him out tobattle, what would he be doing? The original goods could push Luo Binghe onto the battlefield, because he was shameless! He didn’t care about the Sect’s reputation! He hated Luo Binghe to the bone, enough to use the hands of demons to torture him! But now, Shen Qingqiu didn’t meet any of these three points! At the end of everything, why must someone else be responsible for the dignified protagonist’s satisfaction points! Shen Qingqiu was still angrily rebuking the System for being unscientific, when the time came for the second match to begin. Sha Hualing was afraid Shen Qingqiu would fight all three matches, and quickly said, “If the same person enters all three matches, it would lose the meaning of exchanging pointers. My people’s participant for the second match, will be me.” For her to enter, first it was of course because she believed in her own strength, second it was also because she thought Shen Qingqiu probably wouldn’t use his position as a senior to bully a junior. Shen Qingqiu didn’t want to pay any attention to her thoughts at all and demonstrated so; even if he’d originally had the ambition to fight all three matches, to earn martial ability points and reputation, after hearing the System’s notification, it’d wilted. However, the second match, also had an impressive gimmick worth watching. Shen Qingqiu said, “You’ve all heard her words. Who is willing to bear this heavy duty?” Even though he was asking all the disciples in their Sect, his gaze fell on a certain region. Within that region all stood graceful female disciples; without a doubt, they were Xian Shu Peak’s disciples. Within this group of pretty girls 58 , each fairer, more beautiful, and more refined than the last, there was one person who inharmoniously wore a veil. Right after Shen Qingqiu asked this question, this person slowly came out. Shen Qingqiu felt a difficult-to-control burst of excitement. It’s here! It’ll soon be here! The two big female leads in this book, their first VS 59 ! Liu Mingyan was a great beauty. A heaven-and-earth-shattering great beauty at which gods and ghosts would weep. Even though she belonged to Xian Shu Peak, which had produced generations of beautiful women since ancient times, her existence was still a crane among chickens, above and beyond themall. Her older brother was Baizhan Peak’s master, but because she was younger she’d entered the Sect later, and became a disciple of Xian Shu Peak’s next generation. Because her face was excessively beautiful, capable of stealing souls, she had to hide her face with a veil all year round, like a flower on a high cliff, unattainable and out of reach. In brief, for the purpose of describing this character’s appearance, Master Airplane Shooting Towards The Sky had probably used all the flattering vocabulary and idioms he’d learned from elementary to high school; it must have been difficult for him. Shen Qingqiu was very fond of this female lead, and it wasn’t only because Liu Mingyuan’s beauty points were the highest. It was also because this woman had great poise, understood the whole picture, grasped the general situation, and her conduct was fair and honest; within Luo Binghe’s gigantic harem, it was rare to have a wife with both intelligence and moral character. There was also one more point. Liu Mingyan was the only female character for whom Airplane Shooting Towards The Sky didn’t write detailed sex scenes. Even though many readers were very unsatisfied with this arrangement, to point they spammed the comments with ranting, but this also gave Liu Mingyan something no other female lead had: an image as clear as ice and pure as jade! Can’t be helped, the unobtainable ones would always be the best  (  ”)  What made this battle worth watching was this point. If there was an evil, demonic girl, naturally there would be a just, holy one. Every man has dreamed of being caught between an angel and a devil. To watch them being jealous of each other over himself one instant, then be willing to risk life and limb over himself the next, was every male organism’s highest, most-fantasized-over, and sacred scene. You had to say, “Great Master” Airplane was really good at grasping what people found gratifying! Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help giving Luo Binghe another glance. Luo Binghe found it very hard to not care about his gaze. Why exactly did Shen Qingqiu keep paying attention to him? Could it really be that Shizun… minded him this much? A pity, under “Great Master” Airplane Shooting Towards The Sky’s pen, battles between female characters, other than ripping beep for the male gaze,there was usually nothing impressive worth watchingah no, actually if one thought about it, under his pen none of the battles were worth watching, because it was always the same phrases, like “flash of white light”, “a rainbow of colors,” “multicolored sword energy,” “so horrific 60 .” Several incense times later, Liu Mingyan lost. After all, at this time she hadn’t gone to Wan Jian Peak to find her personal sword; even though she did her utmost, her weapon was only a thin, ordinary sword, while Sha Hualing was already a Demon Saint: saintly weapons hung all her over body, so there was naturally a gap between their abilities. Liu Mingyuan walked over to Shen Qingqiu. “This disciple lost. For failing the mission, I request Shen-shibo’s punishment.” Shen Qingqiu said, “When no one else would come forward, you assumed this responsibility; this was already not easy; whether you obtained victory or defeat, both would have been within expectations, so you need not be concerned, and only need to win it back in the future.” Having taken back a round, Sha Hualing’s face was glowing, and laughed delicately while saying, “This last match is the round that will decide the victor! I wonder who Senior Shen will send out? This time you must choose carefully.” Shen Qingqiu stood with his hands clasped behind his back, and said with a profound air, “Young miss need not worry. This one has long decided on a person, and can guarantee that, no matter if he wins or loses, this person will become your life’s bane.” Sha Hualing took these words as him trying to scare her, and clapping her hands, said, “Which brave warrior will come out for the third match?” From the crowd of demons, a giant elder slowly walked out. Calling him giant, was because he really was too tall! Definitely taller than one zhang, wouldn’t you say! With a build like that of a bear or a tiger’s, a head of disheveled hair, armor that covered him from head to toe with spikes, and dragging a giant iron hammer. Shen Qingqiu felt like the ground shook lightly with every step he took. Sha Hualing gleefully said, “First to give everyone from the immortal’s mountain a warning, the spikes on Elder Tianchui’s 61 armor are coated with a highly toxic poison; this poison is ineffective against demons, but if a human gets pierced, there is no cure.” The first feeling this sentence gave Shen Qingqiu was: shit, “Great Master” Airplane Shooting Towards The Sky, don’t just name things howeveryou please and without any thought! Calling the one with a single arm Elder Dubi, calling the one whose weapon was a giant hammer, Elder Tianchui. Are you afraid of naming things properly? Meanwhile from the bystanders, it triggered a wave of rage. “Shitty demoness! If you want to compete then just do so; to use poison, how can you say it’s fair!” Sha Hualing retorted, “I didn’t conceal this information. If you think it’s unfair, or are afraid of losing your life to the poison, give up the match and admit defeat, then you won’t need to compete anymore. Us demons won’t mock humans, after all you value your lives, and such is human nature. But my people value glory over everything else!” Amidst the demons’ roaring laughter and the disciples’ cries of condemnation, Shen Qingqiu rubbed between his brows, and silently sighed. A woman like Sha Hualing, when seen from the reader’s perspective where they could bring in the fantasy of being the protagonist, would of course be loved and found gratifying by thousands. But once they became a person next to her in reality, he didn’t believe anyone could bring themselves to like her! It wasn’t because there was a difference from how she was described within the book; in reality, the problem was: she was too close to it! A cruel and vicious personality, along with an infatuation where she threw her brain away; if you weren’t the protagonist better hurry to stay away. The moment you threatened a tiny bit of her or Luo Binghe’s interests, she’d immediately want your life, without even a chance of other punishments like chopping off your hands or feet, or gouging out your eyes instead; even if you were her father you’d have to be careful. In the original work, to help Luo Binghe gain standing in the Demon Realm, wasn’t the one she backstabbed her own father… Shen Qingqiu remained unaffected by Sha Hualing’s provocation, and left a stretch of silence, using the time to pressure the crowd of demons; only at the end did he turn around, fixing his gaze in a certain person’s direction. “Luo Binghe, you come out.”"
清静峰一众弟子，顿时一片哗然。 其他人门下的弟子还好，因为不熟悉清静峰的情况，还以为派出的一定是沈清秋的得意弟 子天纵奇才，才能来对阵这个一看就起码有几百岁的魔族长老，只是奇怪怎么以前从来没 听过这个人，而且看上去年纪也不大。清静峰上那一群人还能不清楚洛冰河的斤两吗？ 明帆脸都白了，期期艾艾叫道： “ 师尊 …… 派这小杂 …… 派洛师弟上场，不太适合吧？ ” 沈清秋： “ 哦，那你上？ ” 明帆连连摇头。虽说他既不想上场，也很乐意让洛冰河去挨揍，但事关本派荣辱啊！让人 打上山摘了牌子，还输了比试，苍穹山丢脸，清静峰更是大大的丢脸！ 宁婴婴更是急得眼泪都出来了，耍赖似的抱住洛冰河的胳膊，边跺脚边叫： “ 不要不要不 要！ ” 洛冰河没什么实战经验，那魔族长老浑身带刺带毒，那柄锤子也起码有几百斤，这 不被打死才怪！ 你们以为我想让他上场的吗？我也是被逼无奈啊！ 沈清秋道： “ 我说让他上就让他上，你们对为师的决定有什么不满么？婴婴，放开他。 ” 宁婴婴见师父板起了脸，知道没办法了。 洛冰河安抚地拍拍她，虽然脸色苍白，却语音坚定道： “ 师姐不要担心。我虽然不中用， 但既然师尊派我出场，我一定会全力以赴，就算拼了性命，也不能丢本派的脸。 ” 宁婴婴抹抹眼泪放开洛冰河的手臂，似乎不忍心留在这里看心上人挨打，跺了几脚嘤嘤嘤 地跑了。 沈清秋大喜，跑了好，跑了的话这场戏后面宁婴婴搅出来的岔子也没了！ 众人见站出来的这个少年虽神形清正，苗子和根底都不错，但一看就是修为尚浅的年轻弟 子。反观魔族派出来的那名大锤长老，虎背熊腰的身躯往那里一站，对比洛冰河还在发育 的身形，就形成一种压迫感，浑身散发着黑腾腾的魔气。众人都有些迟疑，有的猜测也许 是在隐藏实力，可等到真正开打，大家都无语了。 什么隐藏实力！他是真的打不过啊！ 这哪里是比斗，根本是单方面挨打！ 洛冰河自从进场后，根本就没有出手的机会。那名魔族长老力大无比，一柄大锤挥舞的虎 虎生风，虽然洛冰河尽力闪避和寻找间隙攻击，锤子还是不时砸在他身上。 不仅苍穹山这边目瞪口呆，魔族那边也咋舌不已：这也太惨了吧 …… 有人小声道： “ 这不是输定了嘛 …… 还比什么？ ” 大锤，哦不，天锤长老仰天长笑，声若洪钟： “ 说的很是！小娃娃还是早早认输下场，老 夫还可以留你一条性命。 ” 沈清秋淡淡地道： “ 他会赢的。 ” 废话。挂逼主角，当然会赢的。只是会赢的略艰难。 他声音不高不低，却刚好能传到比试场的中央。 洛冰河正面遭受重创，几口血闷在胸腔，听到这么笃定的一句话传到耳朵里，不知怎的， 就把淤血咽了下去。 会赢 …… 吗？ 师尊是因为真的觉得他会赢，才把上场的机会给他的？ 魔族众人大笑着起哄。嚷嚷着叫他快点认输。 而洛冰河却不随他们的意愿，一连受创数次，居然越发镇定起来，对外界哄叫充耳不闻。 脚步也越发轻盈。天锤长老的巨锤十次倒有九次都沾不了他的边了。 天锤长老身上唯一没有被毒刺甲包裹的地方，就是他的脸和拳头。这并不是什么很好的消 息。这代表他这两个地方练到了家，即便没有毒刺甲保护，也不会吃亏。 可同时，这也很可能，是唯一的突破口！ 洛冰河放慢呼吸，凝神细察。 师尊挑他上场，看着明似是为难自己，可反过来看，如果这一场输了，颜面无光的不仅是 洛冰河，连带着整个门派、更包括选他上场的沈清秋自己也会被牵涉其中。 师尊，是真的坚信，他会赢，才选他上场比试的！ 洛冰河同学在丰富的脑补之下，成功开启了弥天大雾系统。 从来没有人这样信任过他。 就算是为了这份大胆的托付，他也必须赢下来给所有人看！ 那柄大锤又一次挟着沉沉的破风声袭来。洛冰河瞳孔骤缩，掌心运力，凝气成诀！ 所有人都被这个坚持不懈的少年吸引了。虽然洛冰河暂时没有反击的空隙，却一直没有放 弃寻找反击的机会，更没有认输。而这一刻，反击的刹那终于到来，机会的尾巴也被洛冰 河无比精准地抓在了手中。 僵持了进半个时辰后，第三场比试，终于有了结果。 除了沈清秋，所有人都没预料到这个结果。 拥有百年功力、满身毒刺的天锤长老，居然被一个十五岁的少年打败了！ 柳溟烟和纱华铃果然被洛冰河所吸引，四只美目齐齐望了过来，凝视着洛冰河的身影，迟 迟不肯撤去。 【得到柳溟烟 & 纱华铃关注；苍穹山派魔族入侵之战一战成名；主角爽度 +500. 】 沈清秋很生气。 凭什么！扣就扣 1000 ，加只加 500 ，黑心系统双标 > 但是，没关系，现在所有人心里想的都是一样的东西。 洛冰河，真是后生可畏！ 沈清秋，真是深不可测！ 纱华铃憋了半晌，终于挤出一句： “ 苍穹山果然人才济济，少年英雄辈出。铃儿 …… 很是 佩服。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 好说好说。既然比试已经有了结果，姑娘可否撤回你们的族人了？恕苍穹山 目下忙乱，无法招待远客。 ” 言下之意 …… 根本不是言下之意，他这就是在直接明白地下逐客令。 纱华铃有气没地方发，手指拧了一阵身上的红纱，忽然爆发了。 她一伸手，猛地打了天锤长老又快又狠的一耳光，娇声怒斥道： “ 与沈前辈门下这般年轻 的弟子对阵，却输得这么难看，魔族的脸都被你丢尽了！ ” 天锤长老也是可怜，魔界等级森严，纱华铃又是出身高贵的圣女，他挨了一耳光，却唯唯 诺诺不敢反抗，只敢不住道： “ 属下无能，但求圣女责罚！ ” 沈清秋看不下去了： “ 纱姑娘，如果想要教训属下，请到别处去教训。穹顶峰可不是贵族 发威的地界。 ” 纱华铃一耳光泄了愤，总算出了口恶气，一回头，又满脸堆笑道： “ 沈前辈说的是。铃儿 只是看到您门下的青年才俊，再看看自己手下这对废物，心里好生失望，才一时失控，前 辈千万不要笑话。 ” 她再一转脸，对天锤长老又是一张冷若冰霜的 □□ 脸： “ 独臂长老与沈前辈对峙输了是理所 当然。你却也输了比试，不用我说了，你自己看着办吧。 ” 这个 “ 自己看着办 ” 是什么意思，天锤当然再清楚不过。 他的心当场凉了半截。原本觉得这穹顶峰上除了沈清秋都是半大的小娃娃，修为浅薄的弟 子，才想捡个现成便宜，在新圣女面前邀功，却没想到栽了个大跟头，连性命都要不保 了。他一转眼，看见洛冰河被众人围在中间，嘘寒问暖，歹意顿生。 沈清秋他不敢动，这个害他这么惨的小娃娃，却非要拉着跟他一块儿死垫背不可！ 沈清秋格外留神着这群魔族的没一个动作和神情。天锤眼睛里一闪而过的毒意当然没被漏 过。可魔族真是个奔放的种族，说干就干，一点缓冲时间都没有，上一秒才生出这个意思 ，下一秒就挥舞着大锤撞了上去！ 天锤长老身形高大，快速逼近，就像一座铁山迎面飞来，洛冰河受创不轻，动作迟缓，眼 看着要被砸上一记。却听沈清秋冷哼一声，身形忽然闪现，扇尖在天锤长老膝弯处一点。 天锤长老当场就跪了。 是真跪了！整个身躯摔到地上，不省人事。那柄大锤也被沈清秋顺手捞了起来，提在手里 掂了掂，果然有点分量。不过他这么一个气质高雅的形象拿一柄巨锤总归不太美观，沈清 秋立刻把它扔进魔族聚集地。锤身铛的一声闷响，砸入地面，分量惊人，声势更是骇人。 沈清秋皮笑肉不笑道： “ 想灭口？我门下弟子，还轮不到你们来欺负。 ” 正气凛然说这话时，不光魔族众人无言以对，连沈清秋自己都心中老脸暗红。 仙师，不正是您老人家自己把这个弟子送出去让人虐的吗！ 洛冰河看着挡在自己身前的青衣背影，连道谢都忘了。只知道，师尊又救了他一次。 师尊总是这样，看似对他严苛，却总是会在最危急的关头，挡在他前面。 沈清秋回头瞄他一眼： “ 没事吧？ ” 心虚地刷一刷好感度 …… 洛冰河忙道： “ 弟子没事！多谢师尊相救。 ” 哎呀呀，这孩子傻白甜的，让沈清秋老脸越发要红，忙转头，对纱华铃道： “ 纱姑娘，自 己的属下自己好好管教。既然输不起，当初又为何要定下三场比试之约？ ” 纱华铃也没料到会有刚才那么一出，微感尴尬，正想说几句场面话，谁知道，就在这个时 刻，异变突生。 本来瘫死地上一动不动的天锤长老突然一跃而起，不懈地再次朝洛冰河扑去！,"CHAPTER 12: FRENZIED INFLUX OF FAVOR Qing Jing Peak’s group of disciples immediately fell into an uproar. The disciples from the other branches thought it alright, as they were not familiar with Qing Jing Peak’s situation; they even thought that Shen Qingqiu would definitely send a disciple he was proud of, an unparalleled talent; only that way could they face this demon elder that appeared to be in his hundreds; it was just strange that they’d never heard of this person, and when looking at him he seemed rather young. Could Qing Jing Peak’s group not be clear about Luo Binghe’s abilities? Ming Fan’s face had gone white, and he stammered, “Shizun… to send this little mon… send Luo-shidi; doesn’t it seem unfitting?” Shen Qingqiu: “Oh, then you go?” Ming Fan shook his head multiple times. Even though he didn’t want to enter, and was happy to let Luo Binghe get beaten up, this concerned their Sect’s reputation! To let others invade the mountain and take their inscription, along with losing the competition, Cang Qiong Mountain would lose face, and Qing Jing Peak, even more, would lose a massive amount of face! Ning Yingying was even more anxious, to the point she was tearing up; acting in defiance, she grabbed Luo Binghe’s arm while stomping and yelling, “No no no!” Luo Binghe had no real battle experience: a demon elder covered from head to toe with spikes and poison, with that hammer also weighing at least several hundred jin, he’d definitely be beaten to death like this! You lot think I want him to enter? I was also forced into this; I have no choice! Shen Qingqiu said, “I said let him enter, so let him enter; are you unsatisfied with this master’s decision? Yingying, let go of him.” Ning Yingying saw that her master’s face had become stony, and knew there was nothing she could do. Luo Binghe patted her soothingly; even though his face was stark-white, he said in a steady voice, “Don’t worry, shijie. Even though I won’t be useful, since Shizun has sent me out, I will definitely spare no effort; even if I must stake my life, I won’t lose face for the Sect.” Ning Yingying rubbed away her tears and let go of Luo Binghe’s arm; as if she couldn’t stand to stay here and watch her crush take a beating, she stomped her feet several times then ran off, whimpering.Shen Qingqiu was overjoyed; good, run; if she ran then the trouble she’d have made after this drama would also be gone! The crowd saw that although the youth who came out was upright and honorable in body and spirit, with good potential and foundation, a single glance showed that he was a young disciple with shallow cultivation. In contrast, that Elder Tianchui sent by the demons, standing there with his bear-like build, when compared with Luo Binghe’s still-developing figure, radiated an oppressive air, his entire body emitting dark, roiling demonic qi. Everyone had some hesitations, while some conjectured that perhaps Luo Binghe was hiding his strength, but when the fight actually started, they were all speechless. What hiding his strength! He really wouldn’t be able to beat him! This wasn’t a match, but simply a one-sided beatdown! From the moment he stepped in, Luo Binghe essentially had no chance to strike. That demon elder had incomparable strength, his swings filled with the vigor of a tiger; even though Luo Binghe did his best to dodge and search for an opening to attack through, from time to time the hammer still managed to smash into him. Not only was Cang Qiong Mountain’s side dumbstruck, the demons’ side was also at a loss for words; this was too horrible… Someone quietly said, “Isn’t this a definite loss… what’s the point of the match?” Elder Dachui 62 , ah no, Elder Tianchui laughed facing the sky, the sound like a great bell. “Well said! Little children should hurry up and admit defeat, then this old one can still spare your life.” Shen Qingqiu lightly said, “He will win.” Bullshit. He was the overpowered protagonist; of course he’d win. Just, the path to victory would be difficult. His voice was neither high nor low, but just enough to travel to the center of the match area. Luo Binghe had directly taken heavy blows, and was holding back several mouthfuls of blood within his chest; upon hearing such confident words enter his ears, he somehow managed to swallow down the blood. He will… win? Shizun had given him the chance to enter, because he really thought he would win? The group of demons laughed and jeered. Shouted at him to hurry up and admit defeat.Yet Luo Binghe did not follow their wishes; after taking several injuries in a row, he actually became more and more poised, turning a deaf ear to the jeers and shouts from without. His steps also became lighter and more graceful. Elder Tianchui’s giant hammer could not even brush him, nine out of ten times. The only places on Elder Tianchui’s body that weren’t covered with spikes, were his face and fists. This wasn’t actually good news. This meant that these two places had been trained extensively, that he wouldn’t be at a disadvantage even without the protection of the poisonous spikes. But at the same time, this was also very likely to be, the only breach in his defenses! Luo Binghe slowed his breaths, and attentively observed. For Shizun to pick him, though it seemed obvious that he was making things difficult for him, but conversely, if he lost this round, not only would Luo Binghe lose face, but the entire Sect as well, and furthermore the one who’d chosen to enter him, Shen Qingqiu himself would also be implicated. Shizun really did firmly believe he would win, only then would he choose to enter him in the match! With Student Luo Binghe’s plentiful imagination, he successfully activated a Massive Misunderstandings 63 System. No one had ever believed in him like this. If only because he’d been entrusted with something so audacious, he absolutely had to win so everyone could see! That huge hammer once again came whistling towards him. Luo Binghe’s pupils shrank, and gathering energy within his palms, condensed his qi into an attack! Everyone watching had been captured by this youth who kept persevering without pause. Though Luo Binghe right then had no space to counterattack, he’d also never given up looking for a chance to do so, and furthermore refused to admit defeat. At this instant, the chance to counterattack came, and Luo Binghe also with incomparable precision, grabbed onto its tail. After a deadlock that approached an hour, the third match finally came to a conclusion. Other than Shen Qingqiu, no one had anticipated this conclusion. Elder Tianchui who was covered from head to toe in poisonous spikes, and had a hundred years’ worth of skill, had actually been defeated by a youth of fifteen years! Sure enough, Liu Mingyan and Sha Hualing were drawn to Luo Binghe;four beautiful eyes gazed neatly over, fixing on Luo Binghe’s form and unwilling to avert. Captured Liu Mingyan & Sha Hualing’s attention; became famous in a fight during the battle with the demons invading Cang Qiong Mountain Sect: protagonist satisfaction +500. Shen Qingqiu was furious. How dare you! A single deduction was 1000, yet an addition only 500; black-hearted System, double-standards-holding dog! However, it was fine, right now everyone was thinking the same thing. Luo Binghe, though young, was truly worthy of respect! Shen Qingqiu, was truly beyond comprehension! Sha Hualing held herself back for a long while, then finally squeezed out a line. “Cang Qiong Mountain really is full of talent, producing generations of young heroes. Ling-er… is truly impressed.” Shen Qingqiu said, “Well-said, well-said. Since the match already has a result, could the young miss withdraw your people? Excuse Cang Qiong Mountain for being such a mess right now; we’re unable to entertain guests from faraway.” The meaning hidden within his words… well, they weren’t even hidden; him doing this was a direct command telling them to get out. Sha Hualing was filled with anger, but there was nowhere for it to go; her fingers wrung at the red gauzy cloth on her body for a while, then she suddenly exploded. She reached out, and fiercely gave Elder Tianchui a fast and violent slap, her sweet voice saying angrily, “To face off against Senior Shen’s young disciple, yet lose so badly, you’ve completely lost all face for the demon race!” Elder Tianchui was also pitiful; ranks within the Demon World were strict, and Sha Hualing was a Saint of noble birth; he took the slap, yet could only be obsequious, not daring to fight back, only to repeatedly say, “This subordinate is incompetent, and begs the Saint for punishment!” Shen Qingqiu couldn’t stand watching anymore. “Miss Sha, if you wish to discipline your subordinates, please go somewhere else to do so. Qiong Ding Peak is not a place for nobles to throw their weight around.” With that slap, Sha Hualing had vented her anger, finally releasing some of her resentment; she turned back, full of smiles and said, “As Senior Shen said. It was just, when Ling-er saw the incredible young talent beneath you, then looked at the trash under me, my heart was filled with disappointment, so I lostcontrol for a moment; begging Senior not to laugh.” She then turned, facing Elder Tianchui with the expression of a stepmother, one as cold as a refrigerator. “For Elder Dubi to lose to Senior Shen in their confrontation was a matter of course. Yet you also lost your match; there is no need for me to say anything, figure out yourself what to do.” What this “figure out yourself what to do” meant, of course Elder Tianchui could not be clearer about. His heart half-chilled on the spot. Originally he’d thought that everyone on Qiong Ding Peak other than Shen Qingqiu were only a bunch of half-grown little children, disciples with shallow cultivation; hence he’d wanted to take advantage of easy pickings to earn achievements before the new Saint; he’d never thought that he’d have a terrible fall instead, to the point he would lose his life. He glanced over and saw Luo Binghe surrounded by a crowd, all asking concernedly after his well-being, and malice surged within him. He didn’t dare touch Shen Qingqiu, but this little child who’d brought him so much misfortune, he absolutely had to make him bear the blame with him, drag him along to their deaths together! Shen Qingqiu had especially been paying attention to the group of demons’ every movement and expression. Of course he hadn’t missed the flash of ill-intent in Elder Tianchiu’s eyes. But demons were truly a bold race, taking action immediately, without even the slightest of buffering time; only a second after coming up with the idea, he rushed forwards while swinging his hammer! Elder Tianchui’s body was large and tall, and quickly closed their distance, like a mountain of metal hurtling towards Luo Binghe; Luo Binghe’s injuries weren’t light, and so his movements were slow; it looked like he would be smashed into. Yet Shen Qingqiu coldly giving a hmph was heard, his figure suddenly appearing in a flash, and the tip of his fan gave a single tap to the bend of Elder Tianchui’s knee. Elder Tianchui fell to his knees on the spot. He really fell to his knees! His entire body crashed to the ground, unconscious. Shen Qingqiu also casually scooped up that giant hammer, and held it in hand, weighing it: as expected, it was a tad heavy. However, with the elegant temperament of his image, him holding a giant hammer was not very aesthetic after all, and so Shen Qingqiu immediately threw it into the group of demons. With a muffled thud, the head of the hammer slammed onto the ground, the display significantly shocking, his intimidating air becoming even more terrifying.Shen Qingqiu’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “You wanted to kill him? My disciples, I won’t give you any chance to bully.” When he spoke these words with awe-inspiring righteousness, not only were the demons at a loss for words, even Shen Qingqiu felt that within himself, his face reddened slightly. Immortal Master, weren’t you the one who sent this disciple out to be abused by others! Luo Binghe watched the teal-clothed back before him, having forgotten to even say thanks. He only knew that Shizun had saved him yet again. Shizun was always like this; it would look like he was harsh on him, yet when it came to the most critical moment, he’d always stand before him. Shen Qingqiu threw a glance behind him. “Are you alright?” Let’s guiltily try and gather some favor points… Luo Binghe rushed to say, “This disciple is fine! Many thanks to Shizun for the rescue.” Aiyaya, this child is so foolishly sweet; it caused Shen Qingqiu’s face within to grow even redder; he quickly turned back and said to Sha Hualing, “Miss Sha, you need to properly discipline your subordinates. If you can’t stand losing, why initially set the deal of using three matches?” Sha Hualing also hadn’t predicted that the attack just now was going to happen, and was slightly embarrassed; she was just about to say a couple of perfunctory words appropriate for the situation, when at that instant, an abnormality no one saw coming occurred. The Elder Tianchui who’d been lying motionless on the ground, suddenly jumped up, and relentlessly threw himself at Luo Binghe a second time!"
他的锤子已经被沈清秋缴了，难不成这是想用身躯压死洛冰河？ 可看见他那张开双臂，仿佛要给洛冰河来一个拥抱的姿势，沈清秋脑子里忽然闪电般转过 几道弯，流出一身冷汗！ 我次奥次奥次奥次奥次奥次奥！他身上还穿着毒刺甲！ 这一刹那，沈清秋完全忘记了洛冰河的金身不破不死定律。千钧一发之际，他下意识再一 次挡了过去。 修雅出鞘，剑光雪亮，直刺入天锤长老的沉重身躯。但他凭着一身蛮力和狠劲，被刺穿个 窟窿也不后退，反而大喜过望，猛地前冲，硬生生让修雅剑从自己后背穿了出来，带着满 脸狰狞的笑意，改扑向沈清秋。 沈清秋当机立断，立马撒手，可惜已经晚了。 右手传来阵阵刺痛，他顿时从心凉到了脚底。 天锤倒在地上，呸的吐出一口血，狂笑道： “ 沈清秋给我陪葬，哈哈哈哈。值！值了！ ” “ 师尊！ ” 洛冰河猛地捉住沈清秋的右手： “ 你被刺中了？！ ” 沈清秋挣开他的手道： “ 没事。没刺中。别听他危言耸听。 ” 说着低头瞅了一眼，心头又是 一串麻溜儿的草草草草草弹幕刷过。 从手背到手臂，一排排的小针眼！已经开始发红了！ 幸好他没有密集恐惧症。反倒是洛冰河看见了以后，脸全白了。 有谁能听到沈清秋心中的惊涛骇浪：妈蛋第几次被主角坑了！都说了他不会死啊不会死！ 你特么上赶着救他干什么啊草草草！ 天锤长老总算拉了个垫背的，还是重量级的垫背的，一点也不沮丧了，得意道： “ 老夫从 不危言耸听。这毒说了无解就是无解。沈峰主，安心等死吧！ ” 剑光一闪，洛冰河抽出修雅剑抵到他脖子上，动作迅捷无伦，沈清秋险些没看清。 洛冰河这时跟换了个人似的，冷冷地道： “ 你们一定有办法，不交出解药，我定让你先 死！ ” 纱华铃突然道： “ 这位小公子，天锤的确没有骗你。这毒叫做 ‘ 无可解 ’ 。对于人来说，确 实无药可解。输了比试还做了这种事，他左右都是要死，又怎么会怕你用死来威胁他 呢？ ” “ 无可解 ” ！ 这辈子就没听过比这更不用心的 □□ 名字了！ 虽然看过原作早就知道有这么种奇毒，但还是无法阻止沈清秋吐槽向天打飞机菊苣取名字 的实用主义风格！ 纱华铃目光闪动，明显是看形势突变，又在打不怀好意的算盘。 沈清秋怎么会不清楚她这角色的尿性，一边运起灵力压下右手不断传来的阵痛和抽搐感， 一边唇带微笑，故作轻松道： “ 话虽这么说不错，可纱姑娘是不是忘了，我已入境多年？ 金丹中期，究竟还算不算凡人呢？ ” 纱华铃神情一变，然而，又很快定了神，娇笑道： “ 是不是凡人我不知道。但我知道有个 法子，可以判定沈前辈到底中毒没有。中了 ‘ 无可解 ’ 的人，会从伤口处开始，隔绝灵力流 通，慢慢波及全身，最后不光灵气，连血液也凝结滞涩。请沈前辈用右手使一记灵力暴击 ，就能见分晓了。 ” 灵力暴击，顾名思义，就是把大股的灵力运集于一点，然后猛地爆发，利用灵力波的剧烈 震荡产生攻击效果。效果类似于扣下扳机、子弹出膛，或者手里扔了个 □□ 出去，具体如 何依发力者的修为而定。 沈清秋私底下试过，他能达到扔出个手榴弹这种程度，可现在，他的右手就像精密机器人 被拆掉电路的一部分，勉强使得上力气，但灵力流动完全被阻隔。 日了狗了，不会就这么给废了吧！ 洛冰河听到了 “ 无可解 ” 的描述，嘴唇颤了颤。 这一刻，沈清秋往日待他的不好，都从他心里被抹消了。 他清清楚楚的，只有师尊被魔族害到可能功力尽废，甚至丧命！ 都是因为他。 沈清秋见他神色变幻，随手摸了摸他的脑袋： “ 不必担心。 ” 沈清秋一抬眼睛，诡谲地笑道： “ 使一使倒也无妨。只是不能白白使。纱姑娘你今日大闹 穹顶峰，沈某一直忍到方才。现在我改主意了，总不能说来就来说走就走，那我苍穹山派 岂不被人耻笑？不如我们对击一掌，定下生死约，无论谁有任何损伤，都是其咎由自取， 后果如何，都一概不得追究。如何？ ” 他现在不能示弱！ 整座穹顶峰上，现在就只靠着他这个长辈撑着了。一旦他倒下去了，依纱华铃的狠辣，轻 则后果是魔族把穹顶殿拆掉，扛着招牌和山门回魔界，从此门派声誉大跌；重则屠山！ 不要怀疑，这女人绝对真的干的出来这种事。 倒不如铤而走险，赌上一把！最后一下，打死她倒也不难！ 沈清秋却没注意到，不知不觉间，他已经没有把身边这些或焦急、或坚定、或愤怒、或彷 徨的弟子们，当做是书中寥寥数语描写出来的群众角色了。 纱华铃咬着嘴唇，很是纠结。 如果沈清秋真的没中毒，两人对击一掌，就是拼灵力的硬碰硬，自己必死无疑；可如果他 只是虚张声势，错过这一锅端了穹顶峰的大好机会，岂不要悔恨终生？ 沈清秋平静地看着她，看神情，既不期待，也不逃避，等她作出决定。 洛冰河扯他的衣袖： “ 师尊，弟子愿代师尊，受这一击。 ” 沈清秋不动声色扯回衣袖： “ 哪有弟子代师父出头的道理？ ” 洛冰河道： “ 师尊是为弟子受伤的 ……” 沈清秋瞪他一眼： “ 既然知道是为你受伤的，就好好护着自己这条命。 ” 洛冰河心头猛遭重击，说不出话，眼眶却红了。 最终，纱华铃一咬牙，道： “ 那沈前辈请恕铃儿无礼了！ ” 沈清秋道： “ 来来来，手不留情，生死由命！ ” 纱华铃心脏砰砰狂跳，连话都不敢回，火红的身影一跃而起，雪白的玉掌挟着一股霸道的 黑色魔气袭来！ 沈清秋一脚踹开洛冰河，准备好了，这一掌，必然两败俱伤！ 然而，他既没有被纱华铃一掌击飞，也没有口吐鲜血爆体而亡。 杀气腾腾、剑已出鞘的百战峰主人一只手指都没有动，单凭从他身上爆发出来的灵流，就 震开了全力攻来的纱华铃。 片刻的寂静之后，穹顶峰上沸腾了。 “ 柳师叔！ ” “ 柳师叔出关了！ ” “ 百战峰战神出关了，魔界妖人，看你们还敢嚣张！ ” 欢呼声比刚才沈清秋辛苦装了半天的 B 加起来还要大，沈清秋泪洒心田：耍个屁的帅！早 点儿出来你会死！留点 B 给我装又怎样！ 这不愧是一本充斥着杀必死的种马文。纱华铃被震开以后，除了啊的一声娇弱惊叫，身上 那本来能遮住的部位就少之又少的红纱也碎裂成一片一片，引起惊呼阵阵。她用漂亮的姿 势打了个滚缓冲，一咕噜爬起来。魔族果然民风奔放，即便浑身马赛克她也毫不羞恼，只 恨恨地扯过一旁属下的披风，胡乱一披，道： “ 各位，今日是我失算。咱们日后有的是再 见的时候！走！ ” 柳清歌冷笑道： “ 说来就来说走就走。好大的脸。想得倒美！ ” 他身形一错，背后的乘鸾剑一飞冲天，画出成百上千道有形剑气，排列成光阵，落雨冰雹 般朝魔族众人刺下。 纱华铃边率部下落荒而逃，边把手中红纱旋成一片红云，向天抛起，可惜根本阻挡不住凌 厉的剑气，红纱很快被刺成一片窟窿满布。再加上苍穹山派的弟子们围堵，大半魔族伤的 伤，被俘的被俘，只有紧跟着纱华铃的那一小批心腹，狼狈万状地逃下了山。 柳清歌归剑入鞘后，板着脸转身，察看沈清秋手上的伤势。清静峰的弟子们也围了上来。 十几张脸都是清一色的紧张。 沈清秋叹道： “ 差婴婴学雪姨狂拍灵犀洞洞壁把你嚎出来，真是个极正确的选择。 ” 柳清歌： “ 雪姨是谁？ ” 沈清秋： “ 人间绝色。我怎么样？ ” 柳清歌哼道： “ 暂时死不了。 ” 话虽这么说，他左手往沈清秋身体里输去的灵力却没断，脸色也愈发严肃。沈清秋看着他 的手，柳清歌特地澄清道： “ 灵犀洞内欠你的，还给你！ ” 死傲娇！ 把柳清歌拉为队友的计划，有戏！可沈清秋浑身灵脉一阵一阵地抽，让他笑不出来。 洛冰河道： “ 柳师叔， ‘ 无可解 ’ 这种毒，真的无可解么？ ” 柳清歌看了他一眼，还没回答，沈清秋忽然膝盖一软，险些跪了。幸好洛冰河一直扶着 他。可沈清秋实在站不住了，摆手道： “ 让我躺下来 …… 让我躺会儿。 ” 洛冰河从没见过沈清秋这么虚软的模样，跪在沈清秋身边，眼睛布满血丝，哽咽道： “…… 师尊。 ” 沈清秋勉强抬起一只手臂，摸了摸一直都很想摸的冰哥的脑袋，忍了老半天的一口鲜血， 总算是颤颤巍巍吐出来了。 饶是如此，他还是坚毅顽强地说完了刷好感度的关键台词。 “ 我知道 …… 你一定会赢。 ” 听了这一句，洛冰河浑身一震。 事后想想，沈清秋觉得如果以上帝视角来看，他会忍受不了地摔书大骂：这 TM 什么角色 啊一会儿打一会儿救的有病吧！精分帝 + 蛇精病！ 这时，系统传来提示。 【沈清秋角色复杂度 +20 ，形象哲学深度 +20 ，人物悬疑度 +10 ，总计 B 格 +50. 】 …… 沈清秋悚然了。角色的哲学深度是这样计算的吗？ 还有请不要随便开启奇怪的数值谢谢！ 两眼发黑的沈清秋一抬头，觉得他好像看见洛冰河的眼泪断线珠子一般坠出了眼眶。 错觉吧。 这是他失去意识前最后一个念头。,"CHAPTER 13: ACTING COOL DRAWS LIGHTNING STRIKES 64 His hammer had already been seized by Shen Qingqiu; could it be that he wanted to use his body to crush Luo Binghe? But looking at his open arms, at his pose like he was about to give Luo Binghe a hug, in Shen QIngqiu’s brain his thoughts suddenly made several lightning-like turns, and his entire body broke out in cold sweat! F-uck f-uck f-uck f-uck f-uck f-uck me! He’s still wearing the poison- spiked armor! In that instant, Shen Qingqiu completely forgot about the rule of Luo Binghe having an indestructible body; subconsciously, he once again moved to block. Xiu Ya left its sheath, blade’s flash bright like snow, and pierced right into Elder Tianchui’s heavy body. But he had behind him an entire body’s worth of brute force and all-out effort, and didn’t back down even with a hole pierced into him; instead he seemed overjoyed, vehemently rushing forward, forcefully letting Xiu Ya run clean through him and out his back, his face stretched in a sinister grin, and switched to throw himself at Shen Qingqiu. Shen Qingqiu quickly made the decision, and promptly gave up stopping him, but it was already too late. From his right hand came stabs of pain, and immediately his heart chilled down to its depths. Tianchui collapsed to the ground, spat out a mouthful of blood, and laughed madly. “Shen Qingqiu, I’ve taken you down with me, hahahaha. Worth it! It was worth it!” “Shizun!” Luo Binghe suddenly grabbed Shen Qingqiu’s right hand. “You’ve been pierced?” Shen Qingqiu wrenched his hand free and said, “Nothing’s wrong. I wasn’t pierced. Don’t listen to his alarmist ravings.” As he spoke he lowered his head to glance at it, and in his heart once again a frantic bullet screen of fuck- fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck rushed by. From the back of his hand to his forearm, were rows and rows of tiny pinholes! They were already turning red! Luckily he didn’t have trypophobia 65 . Instead, after Luo Binghe saw it, itwas his face that went completely white. No one could hear the raging waves in Shen Qingqiu’s heart: motherfucker how many times has the male lead screwed you over! It’s already been said that he won’t die ah, he won’t die! Why did you specially rush to rescue him fuuuuuuck ! Elder Tianchui had finally dragged someone down with him, and it was a heavyweight; no longer even a bit depressed, he gleefully said, “This old man has never spoken only to scare. If I say this poison has no cure, then it has no cure. Peak Lord Shen, be at ease and await your death!” A blade flashed; Luo Binghe pulled out Xiu Ya and held it to his throat; his movements so matchlessly agile, Shen Qingqiu nearly missed them. At this time it seemed as if Luo Binghe was another person; he coldly said, “Your group must have a solution; if you don’t hand over the antidote, I’ll definitely kill you first!” Sha Hualing suddenly said, “Young master, Elder Tianchui really isn’t lying. This poison is called Without-A-Cure 66 . When it comes to humans, it indeed has no cure. To lose a match and also do something like this, only death awaits him; why would he fear you threatening him with death?” “Without-A-Cure!” There has never been a poison named with less effort! Even though he’d seen the original work and had long known about this rare poison, Shen Qingqiu still could not help tsukkomi-ing at the pragmatism of “Great Master” Airplane Shooting Towards The Sky’s naming sense! Sha Hualing’s eyes flashed; it was obvious that with the sudden twist in their circumstances, she was once again scheming something malicious. How could Shen Qingqiu not be clear on her character’s nature; he circulated his spiritual energy to suppress the continuous waves of pain and twitching in his right hand, while his lips bore a smile, purposely putting on a mask of effortlessness and said, “While your words aren’t wrong, has Miss Sha forgotten that I’ve already cultivated for many years? As one in Mid-Core Formation stage, could I still be considered a common person?” Sha Hualing’s expression immediately changed, however, it quickly settled again, and she laughed delicately while saying, “Whether you’re a common person or not, I do not know. But I do know a method that can be used to determine whether Senior Shen has been successfully poisoned. When a person is affected with Without-A-Cure, starting from their wound, their spiritual flow will become disconnected, then this will slowly spread to theirentire body; in the end not only their spiritual qi, but even their blood will coagulate and stagnate. I ask Senior Shen to send a spiritual blast with his right hand, then we will understand.” A spiritual blast 67 , as the name implied, involved amassing a large amount of spiritual energy into a single point, then letting it violently explode, using the waves of spiritual energy’s powerful oscillations as an attack. The effect was similar to pulling a trigger and releasing a bullet, or hurling a detonator; how it appeared in reality depended on the cultivation of the user. Shen Qingqiu had attempted it privately himself, and had been able to achieve the level of throwing a grenade; but now, his right hand was like intricate robot’s with part of its circuit shorted out; he forcefully exerted himself, but his spiritual flow had been completely cut off. Goddamnit, he couldn’t have been crippled with just this, right! Upon hearing “Without-A-Cure’s” description, Luo Binghe’s lips trembled. In this instant, all the times Shen Qingqiu had wronged him in the past were wiped clean from his heart. The only thing he was clear about, was that the demons had harmed Shizun to the point that his abilities might be crippled, even his life might be forfeit! All because of him. Shen Qingqiu saw his expression fluctuate, and patted his head in passing. “No need to worry.” Shen Qingqiu lifted his eyes, smiling slyly while saying, “There’s no harm in trying. Only that I can’t do it without some return. Miss Sha, today you ran amok in Qiong Ding Peak, this one has been enduring it until now. Now I’ve changed my decision: I can’t let you come and go as you please; if I do, won’t Cang Qiong Mountain Sect become a laughingstock? How about we exchange one palm strike, and set down a contract of life and death: no matter who is injured and how, we bear all blame ourselves; whatever the result, we must accept it completely. How about it?” He couldn’t show weakness now! The entire Qiong Ding Peak now depended only on him, a member of the older generation, for support. As soon as he fell, with Sha Hualing’s mercilessness, at best the result would be the demons destroying Qiong Ding Hall, then carrying the inscription and mountain gates back to the Demon World, and thereafter their sect’s reputation would plummet; at worse it’d be a massacreof the entire mountain! Don’t doubt it, this woman was definitely capable of doing something like this. It would be better to take a desperate risk, and make this one gamble! Killing her at the last moment wouldn’t be difficult! Shen Qingqiu hadn’t noticed that unconsciously, he no longer considered the disciples around him, whether they were anxious, resolute, angry, or indecisive, as mob characters the novel had described in a scant number of words. Sha Hualing bit at her lip, incredibly torn. If Shen Qingqiu really hadn’t been poisoned, this exchange of blows would directly pit their spiritual strength against each other, and she would definitely be killed; but if he was only bluffing, and she missed this big chance to wipe out Qiong Ding Peak, wouldn’t she regret it for life? Shen Qingqiu calmly looked at her; on his expression was neither anticipation nor avoidance, waiting for her to make her decision. Luo Binghe yanked his sleeve: “Shizun, this disciple is willing to take Shizun’s place, and receive this strike.” Shen Qingqiu yanked his sleeve back without batting an eyelid. “In what sense is a master standing behind his own disciple acceptable?” Luo Binghe said, “Shizun was injured for this disciple’s sake…” Shen Qingqiu gave him a glare: “Since you know it was for your sake, then properly protect this life of yours.” Luo Binghe’s heart suffered a heavy blow; he was unable to speak, but the rims of his eyes turned red. At last, Sha Hualing gritted her teeth and said, “Then Senior Shen, please forgive Ling-er’s rudeness!” Shen Qingqiu said, “Come, come, I won’t show any mercy, let fate decide who lives or dies!” Sha Hualing’s heart thundered in her chest, and she didn’t even dare reply, her fire-red figure rising with a leap, her snow-white, jade-like palm bearing a billow of overwhelming, black, demonic qi! Shen Qingqiu kicked Luo Binghe aside, having made his preparations, with this one strike, he’d ensure there were no winners! However, he was neither sent flying by Sha Hualing’s palm strike, nor did he cough up fresh blood, with his body destructing and killing him. Roiling with killing intent, the master of Bai Zhan Peak whose sword hadalready left its sheath, without even lifting a single finger and using only the spiritual energy bursting forth from his body, blasted away the Sha Hualing who was attacking with her entire strength. After a short silence, Qiong Ding Peak boiled over. “Liu-shishu!” “Liu-shishu left seclusion!” “The Bai Zhan Peak War God has left seclusion; you demons, let’s see if you can still be arrogant!” The cheers were greater than the total amount of coolness 68 Shen Qingqiu had painstakingly earned up until now; a rain of tears showered down on Shen Qingqiu’s heart: you damn show-off! Would it kill you to arrive sooner! How about you leave some coolness for me! This truly proved itself to be a fan-service-packed stallion novel. After Sha Hualing was blasted away, other than a single, delicate scream, the red gauzy cloth on her body that had barely covered anything in the first place also tore into shreds, inciting a series of alarmed cries. She used a beautifully-executed roll to cushion herself, and stood up with a grunt. Demons were indeed bold and unrestrained by custom, even though her entire body was censored out she wasn’t ashamed in the slightest, and only spitefully tore off the cloak of a subordinate beside her, carelessly throwing it over herself while saying, “Everyone, today was my miscalculation. We will definitely meet again in the future! Let’s go!” Liu Qingge sneered and said, “Coming and going as you please. How shameless! Dream on!” His posture shifted, and the Cheng Luan on his back soared into the sky, summoning tangible sword qis by the hundreds and thousands, which arranged themselves into a glowing array before stabbing downwards, descending like rain or hail on the crowd of demons. Sha Hualing led her troops and fled while whirling a piece of red gauze above her head, before throwing it upwards; unfortunately, it simply could not block the fierce rain of sword qis; the red gauze was quickly pierced full of holes. On top of that, Cang Qiong Mountain Sect’s disciples were hemming them in, and so most of the demons suffered great injuries or were captured; only the small heart of the group that had kept right up against Sha Hualing managed to flee down the mountain, thoroughly battered and humiliated. After returning his sword to his sheath, Liu Qingge turned, stone-faced, to examine the condition of the wound on Shen Qingqiu’s hand. The Qing JingPeak disciples also came to surround them. More than ten faces, all filled with the same expression of anxiousness. Shen Qingqiu sighed and said, “It was definitely the right decision, to send Ning Yingying to copy Xue Yi 69 , and pound on the wall of Ling Xi Caves, wailing until you came out.” Liu QIngge: “Who’s Xue Yi?” Shen Qingqiu: “World’s greatest beauty. How am I?” Liu Qingge hmphed and said, “You won’t die for now.” Though he said this, the spiritual energy his left hand was sending into Shen Qingqiu’s body did not stop, and his expression became increasingly grave. Shen Qingqiu looked at his hand, and Liu Qingge specially clarified, “What I owe in Ling Xi Caves, I’m returning!” So damn tsundere ! His plan to nab Liu Qingge as a teammate, had promise! But the meridians of Shen Qingqiu’s entire body underwent a series of convulsions, and so he was unable to smile. Luo Binghe said: “Liu-shishu, does this poison, ‘Without-A-Cure,’ really have no cure?” Liu Qingge glanced at him; before he could answer, Shen Qingqiu’s knees suddenly went weak, and he almost fell into a kneel. Luckily Luo Binghe had been supporting him the entire time. But Shen Qingqiu really could not stand anymore, and waved his hand while saying, “Let me lie down… let me lie down for a while.” Luo Binghe had never seen Shen Qingqiu this weak; he kneeled beside Shen Qingqiu with bloodshot eyes, choking on sobs as he said, “Shizun.” With great difficulty, Shen Qingqiu lifted an arm and patted Bing-ge’s head like he’d always wanted to; the mouthful of fresh blood he’d been holding back, finally spilled falteringly forth. Since things were like this, he still persistently and tenaciously finished saying an important line for currying favor. “I knew that… you’d definitely win.” Upon hearing this sentence, a tremor went through Luo Binghe’s entire body. Thinking about it afterwards, Shen Qingqiu felt that if he’d been looking at this with an omniscient viewpoint, he’d have burst out smashing the book down and cursing: the fuck is with this character ah hurting him one moment saving him the next messed in the head! Multiple personalities and insane!At this time, the System sent a notification. Shen Qingqiu’s character complexity levels +20, character depth levels +20, character suspense levels +10, total B-points +50. Shen Qingqiu was terrified. This was how character depth was calculated? Also, please don’t randomly create strange point types thank you! His vision going dark, Shen Qingqiu lifted his head, and thought he saw Luo Binghe’s tears, falling from his eyes like pearls. Must be mistaken. This was his last thought before he lost consciousness."
不知睡了多久，沈清秋才要死不活地醒过来。 睁眼看见头顶亲切熟悉的白纱幔，就知道是在清静峰他的清静舍里。 他吸了口气，想伸个懒腰，忽然发现房门一开，进来一个人。 明帆端着一个盘子，见他醒了，盘子往桌上一扔，就嚎开了。 “ 师尊你可算醒了！ ” 还有一人站在门外。洛冰河站在门口，似乎想进来，却欲行又止。 明帆嚎了一阵，湿了被单一片，回头呵斥洛冰河： “ 你怎么还站在这里？不知道师尊看了 你就心烦吗？ ” 又对沈清秋道： “ 不知道这小子犯了什么病，非要杵在这里，像根棍子似的 ，撵他也不走！ ” 沈清秋摆手： “ 无妨。随他。 ” 明帆道： “ 我、我这就叫柳师叔、掌门师伯和木师叔去！他们说您一醒就要告诉他们的！ ” 说完一咕噜爬起来往门外冲。 看来这一觉真是睡了很久 …… 岳清源已经回来了。至于 “ 木师伯 ” ，说的必然是千草峰的木 清芳。千草峰擅药，精于医术，那是必须到场的。 洛冰河让开路，见明帆走远了，还不肯离去，只定定望着屋内，拳头一直紧紧握着。 沈清秋慢慢坐直了，道： “ 可是有话要说？那便进来。 ” 洛冰河依言走进屋来，忽然在他床前扑通一声，跪下了。 沈清秋： “…… ！！！ ” 系统你等下？怎么回事？我只是睡了一觉而已，为什么醒来就变这种模式了？我到底睡了 多久？现在已经是十年后了吗？ 洛冰河跪下后，抬起头，目光炙热且愧疚： “ 请师尊原谅弟子以往的愚昧无知。 ” 愚昧无知这四个字，跟谁放到一起都不能和洛冰河放到一起啊？ “ 弟子原先只以为，师尊并不十分关心自己。直到第三场比试之后，我才明白师尊往日的 苦心。 ” 沈清秋：不不不，原先你那师尊是真的不关心你，他巴不得你死，真的 …… 不过，你到底 明白了我的什么苦心？你倒是说说看，我自己也很好奇！ 洛冰河却偏不接着说下去了，只认真地道： “ 从今往后，弟子一定尽心尽责服侍师尊，唯 师尊命是从。 ” 沈清秋神色复杂地看着他。 救了他一回，以前的打骂凌虐全都忘光了？这好感度也太好刷了吧？ 当然，他是无法体会当时洛冰河那百转千回的心路历程的。 沈清秋默然片刻，道： “ 你明白就好。先起来吧。 ” 虽然他一点都不明白，冰哥你究竟领悟了啥啊？ 见洛冰河慢慢站起身，却仍不肯离去，反而略见忸怩，似乎有什么话想说。沈清秋问道： “ 还有什么事吗？ ” 洛冰河道： “ 师尊睡了许多天，刚刚醒来，不知是否有胃口？ ” 其实严格来讲，沈清秋早捱过了辟谷，不吃东西也无事。但无法抗拒口腹之欲的天性，一 听有吃的就眼睛发绿： “ 很有。非常有。 ” 洛冰河立刻跑去厨房，他这几日每隔一时辰就重做一道粥，总算是派上用场了。还冒着热 气的粥端上了桌，洛冰河扶着沈清秋从床上坐起，殷勤到另人发指，就差没喂到沈清秋嘴 里去了。沈清秋小臂上冒出了一点鸡皮疙瘩，自己拿过勺子吃了几口，见洛冰河还站在床 边，巴巴地望着他。 沈清秋想了想，恍然大悟，矜持地赞许道： “ 味道不错。 ” 味道岂止是不错。清静峰这一脉一听就是走清新寡淡风的，连厨子的风格都是这个路线， 吃了这么久沈清秋嘴里都要淡出鸟来。而手里这一碗虽然也是粥，不过也许是调料和手法 问题，跟以往那种清汤寡水的粥不是一个等级的。雪白的粥米，细碎的葱花，鲜美的肉沫 ，还有恰到好处的姜丝，适宜的温度！ 久违了。沈清秋几欲迎风流泪。 洛冰河听他夸赞，眼睛顿时亮晶晶的，道： “ 师尊若是喜欢，弟子每日都给师尊变着花样 做如何？ ” 沈清秋当场呛了一下。 洛冰河忙给他拍背。沈清秋摆手说没事。 他只是有点惊悚。 洛冰河的好厨艺是把妹的一大杀器，没想到他竟有此殊荣，吃到了原作中屈指可数的几位 重点后宫妹子才吃得到嘴的 “ 洛冰河 の 料理 ” 。 更惊悚的是那句台词啊台词。这句 “ 每日都给你变着花样做（饭） ” ，不是洛冰河把几位大 小姐哄得心花怒放甘愿入后宫时用的吗？ 东西可以乱吃，话不能乱说！ 见沈清秋表情诡异，洛冰河略有不安，问： “ 师尊不喜欢吗？ ” 白给我做的谁不喜欢谁傻叉。沈清秋和颜悦色道： “ 为师很是喜欢。那今后这些就交给你 了。 ” 终于不用继续吃清汤寡水了。堂堂清静峰领导，岂能连个小灶也开不起！ 得到肯定，洛冰河一下子又春暖花开起来。沈清秋瞧他那个样子，不知为什么，忽然手痒 ，又想摸摸他的脑袋。莫非冰哥的头有特殊的磁场？否则为何手总是不受控制？ 打发走（白给人定了当苦力还）喜笑颜开的洛冰河后，沈清秋敲了敲系统。 “ 无间深渊那里的剧情非走不可？ ” 系统：【若洛冰河错过 “ 无间深渊 ” 剧情线，爽度 10000 。】 听清了后面那个数字，沈清秋又是习惯性的一口凌霄血。吐完摸摸嘴，算了，吐啊吐啊的 也就吐习惯了。 很合理。如果不能把洛冰河打入无间深渊，那他就开不了金手指。主角不能开挂，那还有 什么爽度？ 所以，无间深渊的剧情，非走不可。而作为本书第一猥琐、第一人渣的反派，这个光荣任 务的执行者，当然，必须，当仁不让，非他莫属。 他还不死心地再问一下，只是唏嘘，还不能彻底死心。现在这个小太阳一样的洛冰河，注 定要堕落成那个阴暗冷血的魔族青年。连他这种理应开挂的穿书重生者也无法改变这个事 实。 他，注定是要把主角一掌打下无间深渊、开启一代挂逼传奇之旅的男人！ 这份工作真的很没前景。 不干，爽度直接减去 10000 ，死得不能再透了。 干了，洛冰河开了金手指黑化以后，绝对不会绕过他。 平时的福利也差，勤恳工作薪水微薄 …… 这都是些什么事儿啊！ 洛冰河前脚没走多久，几位师兄师弟后脚就探病来了。 沈清秋躺在床上，把小话本套在道德经里面看，见岳清源先进来，不动声色合上书，小话 本掖被子里，道德经的封面亮出来，想下床，岳清源忙制止了他： “ 别乱动。你现下不宜 落地。躺着就是。 ” 转向身后的木清芳： “ 木师弟，你再来给他看看吧。 ” 昏迷期间，木清芳已经为沈清秋诊治过一次。现在大概算复诊，沈清秋把手腕给他，有礼 道： “ 有劳木师弟。 ” 木清芳微微一怔，点了点头，坐在床边，手指搭上他的脉门。以他千草峰峰主的医术，怎 样的疑难杂症，判定和应策都只需要一瞬，可他还是认认真真搭了半晌，才神色凝重移开 手指。 岳清源问道： “ 如何？ ” 事关功体，沈清秋毫不矜持： “ 这毒究竟能不能解？ ” 柳清歌袖袍一振，在桌边坐下，哼道： “ 它名字叫无可解，你说呢？ ” 沈清秋叹气道： “ 那木师弟干脆说说我还能活几年？几个月？还是几天？ ” 木清芳摇摇头，道： “ 虽然无可解，却有可抑。 ” 他声音平和，不轻不重，沈清秋却觉得自己赚大发了。 这毒虽然名叫 “ 无可解 ” ，但它其实是可以解的。 因为原作中，在那场 □□ 迭起的仙盟大会里，有位娇柔婉约的别派小师妹也中了这种魔族 奇毒。 关键在于，她是主角的妹子啊。 你见过有种马文的男主让自己的妹子死于奇毒的吗？ 如果有，那就是一个不合格的种马文男主！ 那就是一本扑街万年的失败种马文！ 解法也很简单！让我们来回顾一下原作的发展。 因为剧情的不可抗力，婉约小师妹为了救才刚认识不到一个时辰的男主，中了魔界妖人的 阴招，身染奇毒。洛冰河觉得他有着不可推卸的责任，于是负担起了为婉约小师妹寻找解 药的重任。 刚好在仙盟大会举办的深山里，长着一株有千年之岁的奇花  对不起具体叫什么花还是 什么草沈清秋已经忘记了，因为《狂傲仙魔途》里的各种奇花起码有上百棵而且个个都起 码有千年之岁，再算上奇草奇树，鬼才记得住名字。 向天打飞机，你当奇花是大白菜在大甩卖啊，给奇花们留一点物以稀为贵的尊严好吗！ 洛冰河以为这株传说中的奇花一定能解婉约小师妹身上的毒，费劲千辛万苦为她去摘，光 摘花就费了三天（三十章）。这三天里一边摘花一边打怪，两人眉来眼去培养了深厚的革 命友谊。婉约小师妹身上的毒越来越深，浑身娇弱无力之际，洛冰河终于把花给摘下来 了。两人大喜过望，连忙让婉约小师妹把花给生吃了。 可是，没起作用！毒没解！ 两人心灰意冷。妹子觉得 “ 人之将死，一定要留点回忆才不枉此生。反正我没有几天好活 了，我再也不要压抑自己的感情 ” ，于是趁着娇躯软弱无力，就把洛冰河给推了 …… 洛冰河做做样子抵抗了下就以 “ 她都是为了我。不忍心拒绝她最后一个心愿 ” 为由，半推半 就地从了 …… 那么，毒，究竟是怎么解的？ 啪啪啪戏之后，妹子的毒自然就解了！ 雷吗？俗吗？牵强吗？可是很爽啊对不对！爽雷爽雷的哈哈哈哈 …… 因为洛冰河是人魔混血嘛。而且魔族的那一半血脉是魔族第一圣君传下来的，上古天魔之 血！一点点小小的魔族奇毒，根本不够他塞牙缝的，在两人啪啪啪的过程中，早就被洛冰 河吸过去消化个精光了。顺便连妹子刚才生吃的奇花的营养成分都被他吸收了，于是又功 力大进啊岂可修！,"CHAPTER 14: VULGAR SETUP After sleeping for an unknown length of time, Shen Qingqiu finally awoke, more dead than alive. Opening his eyes and seeing the familiar white, gauzy curtains above his head, he knew that he was on Qing Jing Peak, in his quiet and peaceful residence. He took a deep breath, wanting to stretch, when he suddenly realized that the door had opened, and someone entered. Ming Fan held a tray in both hands; seeing him awake, he threw the tray onto the table, and started to bawl. “Shizun you’re finally awake!” There was still another person standing outside. Luo Binghe stood by the entrance, like he wanted to come in, yet hesitated. Ming Fan bawled for a while, soaking a large patch of the bedsheet, before turning back and rebuking Luo Binghe, “Why are you still standing here? Don’t you know that seeing you annoys Shizun?” He then said to Shen Qingqiu, “I don’t know what’s wrong with this guy; he insisted on staking himself here, like a stick or something, even after shooing him he won’t leave!” Shen Qingqiu waved his hand: “No matter. Let him.” Ming Fan said, “I, I will go and get Liu-shishu, Zhangmen-shibo, and Mu- shishu! They said to tell them when you wake up!” After saying this, he got up with a grunt and rushed outside. Looks like he’d slept for a very long time… Yue Qingyuan had already returned. As for “Mu-shishu,” that must be Qian Cao Peak’s Mu Qingfang. Qian Cao Peak specialized in medication, and was proficient in the art of medicine, so him being here was a must. Luo Binghe let him pass, and even after seeing that Ming Fan had gone a distance, still wouldn’t leave his spot; he only stared fixedly into the room, his fist clenched tightly the entire time. Shen Qingqiu slowly sat up and said, “Do you have something to say? Then come in.” Luo Binghe complied and entered the room, then suddenly with a thump, fell to his knees before the bed. Shen Qingqiu: “…!” Wait a moment, System? What’s going on? All I did was sleep for awhile; how did things become like this after waking up? How long did I sleep for? Is this already ten years in the future? After kneeling, Luo Binghe raised his head, gaze fervent and full of guilt. “Shizun, please forgive this disciple’s foolishness and ignorance up until now.” Foolishness and ignorance, no matter who you’re describing with these words, you can’t describe Luo Binghe with them? “Originally, this disciple was always under the impression that Shizun didn’t care about me at all. Only after the third match, did I understand how much painstaking effort Shizun had put in.” Shen Qingqiu: No no no, your original Shizun really didn’t care about you; he earnestly wished you dead, really… although, exactly what painstaking efforts of mine did you understand? Say it out loud; I’m very curious myself! But Luo Binghe did not continue speaking on that topic, and only earnestly said, “From this day forth, this disciple will definitely carry out my duty and serve Shizun will all my heart, obey only Shizun’s esteemed commands!” Shen Qingqiu looked at him with a complicated expression. All the mistreatment and abuse from the past completely forgotten, just because he’d saved him once? Surely this favor was too easy to curry? Of course, he was unable to understand the course of Luo Binghe’s thoughts at that time, with its hundreds and thousands of twists and turns. Shen Qingqiu was silent for a moment, then said, “As long as you understand. First, why don’t you get up.” Even though he didn’t understand in the slightest; Bing-ge, what exactly did you realize? He watched Luo Binghe slowly stand up, yet he remained unwilling to leave, and instead seemed bashful, as if there was something he wanted to say. Shen Qingqiu asked, “Is there something else?” Luo Binghe said, “Shizun has slept for many days, and just woke up; I was wondering if you have an appetite?” In actuality, strictly speaking, Shen Qingqiu had long restricted himself into inedia; even if he didn’t eat he would be fine. But he was unable to resist his nature of craving good food; as soon as he heard there were things to eat, his eyes went green with desire: “Quite a bit. Very much so.” Luo Binghe immediately ran to the kitchen; every couple of hours for the past few days he’d been remaking a serving of congee, and now it could finally be put to use. After bringing the congee, still steaming hot, to the table, LuoBinghe helped Shen Qingqiu sit up on the bed, so solicitous it made one’s hair stand up, coming just short of feeding Shen Qingqiu directly. Shen Qingqiu’s forearms burst out in a bit of goosebumps; he ate a few mouthfuls using the ladle himself, and saw that Luo Binghe was still standing by his bedside, silently watching him. Shen Qingqiu thought for a moment, then suddenly came to a realization, and reservedly said a few words of praise, “It’s quite good.” It wasn’t just quite good. The branch that was Qing Jing Peak, just from the name you could tell they tended towards the fresh and light, and even the style of their cooks followed this principle; after eating their food for so long Shen Qingqiu’s mouth had become bland enough to hatch chicks 70 . And even though the bowl in his hand was full of congee, perhaps it was an issue of ingredients and technique, but compared to the watery, meager congee he’d had in the past, it was on a different level. Snow-white congee rice, finely chopped scallions, delicious minced pork, and shredded ginger in just the right amount, all at the perfect temperature! It had been too long. Shen Qingqiu almost wept nonsensically 71 . Hearing his praise, Luo Binghe’s eyes immediately shone, and he said, “If Shizun likes it, how about this disciple does this for Shizun everyday, with variations of course?” Shen Qingqiu choked on the spot. Luo Binghe rushed to pat his back. Shen Qingqiu waved him off, expressing that he was fine. He’d only gotten a bit of a shock. Luo Binghe’s excellent cooking skills were his lady-killing weapon; he’d never thought that he would have this rare honor, to eat what only a few key harem members in the original work got to eat: “Luo Binghe no Ryouri 72 .” Even more shocking was that line ah, that line. This line, “I’ll do (this for) you everyday, with variations of course 73 ,” wasn’t that what Luo Binghe had used to coax several spoiled young ladies into willingly and ecstatically entering the harem? Eating whatever you want is fine, but saying whatever you want is not! Seeing that Shen Qingqiu’s expression was strange, Luo Binghe was slightly uneasy, and asked, “Shizun dislikes it?” You made me free food; whoever dislikes it is an idiot. Shen Qingqiu said amiably, “This master likes it very much. From today onwards I’ll leave this to you.”Finally, he didn’t need to continue eating that watery, meager fare. Under the great Qing Jing Peak’s guidance, they probably couldn’t even open a mess hall! Having received approval, Luo Binghe once again blossomed like a spring flower. Shen Qingqiu watched that appearance of his, and without knowing why, his hand suddenly itched, wanting to pat that head again. Could it be that Bing- ge’s head had a special magnetic field? Otherwise why couldn’t he control his hand? After making a happily beaming Luo Binghe leave (returning his goodwill by using him as hard labor), Shen Qingqiu knocked on the System. “Is the scenario at the Endless Abyss unavoidable?” System:If Luo Binghe misses the “Endless Abyss” scenario, satisfaction points -10000. Upon hearing that number at the end, Shen Qingqiu once again, out of habit, vomited a fountain of blood. After vomiting he wiped his mouth; whatever, he’d vomited so much he’d gotten used to it. This was very logical. If Luo Binghe wasn’t struck into the Endless Abyss, then he wouldn’t be able to activate his golden finger. If the protagonist couldn’t become overpowered, then where was the satisfaction? Therefore, the Endless Abyss scenario was unavoidable. And as this novel’s number one loser, number one scummy villain, the execution of this glorious task, naturally, absolutely, inescapably, had to fall to him. Unwilling to give up, he asked for another while, and ended up sighing, still unable to give up completely. Luo Binghe, who was currently like a little sun, was destined to fall and become that gloomy, cold-blooded, demon man. Even a transmigrator like him who ought to have access to cheats, was unable to change this reality. He was designated to be the man who struck the protagonist into the Endless Abyss, catalyzing his overpowered, legendary journey! This job’s outlook was really terrible. If he didn’t do it, his satisfaction points would be deducted by 10000; he couldn’t be more thoroughly dead. If he did it, after activating his golden finger, Luo Binghe definitely wouldn’t let him off. Even the benefits during normal times were bad, having to diligently work while underpaid… what exactly was this! Luo Binghe hadn’t left for long, when several of his sect siblings came tovisit. Shen Qingqiu lay on the bed, reading a novel while hiding it inside a text on Daoism; upon seeing Yue Qingyuan enter, he shut the books without batting an eyelid, so that the novel was tucked inside, with the Daoism text’s cover exposed proudly; he wanted to get off the bed, but Yue Qingyuan hurried to stop him. “Don’t move around carelessly. You shouldn’t be leaving the bed right now. Just keep lying down.” He turned to Mu Qingfang who was behind him. “Mu-shidi, come and take another look.” During the time he was unconscious, Mu Qingfang had already diagnosed and treated him once. This time was probably for further diagnosis; Shen Qingqiu held out his wrist, and politely said, “I’m troubling Mu-shidi.” Mu Qingfang startled briefly, then nodded, sitting by the bed and putting his fingers on Shen Qingqiu’s pulse. With his medical expertise as the Qian Cao Peak Peak Lord, no matter how complicated the case was, he only needed an instant to make a judgment and come up with a prescription, but he still conscientiously stayed there for a long while, before finally removing his fingers, expression solemn. Yue Qingyuan said, “How is it?” As the person concerned, Shen Qingqiu showed no reservedness. “So, can this poison be cured, or not?” Liu Qingge shook out his sleeves, sitting down next to the table and hmphed. “It’s named Without-A-Cure; you think?” Shen Qingqiu sighed and said, “Then Mu-shidi might as well tell me, how many years do I have left? How many months? Or how many days?” Mu Qingfang shook his head, saying, “Even though it’s Without-A-Cure, it can be repressed.” His voice was even, neither quiet nor loud, but Shen Qingqiu felt like he’d hit the jackpot. This poison, although it was called “Without-A-Cure,” in actuality there was a cure. Because in the original work, at the Immortal Alliance Conference with its climax after climax, a lovable and graceful little shimei from another sect had also been hit by this rare poison. The important thing was, she was the protagonist’s woman. Have you ever seen a stallion novel where the male lead let his own woman be poisoned to death? If there was, then he would be a subpar stallion novel male lead!And that would be a shitty failure of a stallion novel! The cure was very simple! Let us review the developments in the original work. Because the plot was unavoidable, to save the male lead that she’d known for less than half an hour, Wanyue-shimei was hit by a demon’s underhanded trick, and her body became infected with the poison. Luo Binghe felt that he had an unshirkable duty, and therefore took on the burden of looking for a cure for Wanyue-shimei. It just happened that deep within the mountains where the Immortal Alliance Conference was being held, there grew a spray of mythical, thousand- year old flowerssorry exactly what the name was, whatever-flower or whatever-grass, Shen Qingqiu had already forgotten, because the number of mythical flowers within Proud Immortal Demon Way numbered at least in the hundreds and every single one was at least a thousand years old, then adding on all the mythical grasses and mythical trees, who the hell could remember all those names. Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky, do you think mythical flowers are like Chinese cabbages on sale; leave mythical flowers at least a little of the dignity that comes with being rare and precious! Luo Binghe had thought that this legendary flower would definitely be able to cure the poison within Wanyue-shimei’s body, and put a tremendous amount of effort into picking it for her; just picking the flower took three days (thirty chapters). For three days they journeyed to pick the flower while fighting monsters, and through exchanging flirtatious glances developed a deep sense of camaraderie. Wanyue-shimei’s poison had worsened, her entire body fragile and devoid of strength, when Luo Binghe finally managed to pick the flower. The two of them were overjoyed, and hurried to let Wanyue-shimei eat the flower raw. However, it was ineffective! The poison wasn’t cured! Both their hearts sank. The girl thought, “since I’m about to die, I must leave behind some memories, that way my life won’t be in vain. I don’t have many days left, after all, so I won’t suppress my feelings anymore;” therefore using her fragile and weak body, she pushed Luo Binghe down… Luo Binghe put up a brief show of resistance, before using the reason of, “she did it all for my sake; I don’t have the heart to reject her final wish,” to yield with half-hearted reluctance, and went along with it… Then, in the end, how was the poison cured?After the papapa 74 scene, the girl’s poison was naturally cured! Is it ridiculous? Cliche? Implausible? But it’s gratifying, right? Ridiculously gratifying, ridiculously gratifying hahahaha… Because Luo Binghe was of both human and demon blood, right. And the demon half of his bloodline was from their number one Saintly Ruler, that of heavenly demons from ancient times! A tiny, insignificant demonic poison, wasn’t even enough to get stuck between his teeth, and had long been absorbed and digested completely by Luo Binghe during their papapa. Incidentally even the nutrients of the mythical flower the girl had just eaten raw were absorbed by him, and so his martial ability once again made great progress, damn it 75 !"
所谓的主角待遇，就是即便踩到狗屎，里面都会藏着秘籍或者仙丹吧。 沈清秋回忆这段，回忆得脸色变幻莫测。连旁人叫他都忽略了，岳清源连唤了好几声，他 才回过神： “ 什么？ ” 木清芳递了一张纸给他： “ 每月持续服用这四位药材，再和一名灵力高强者合力运功，让 他助你灵力如常运转，当无大碍。 ” 顿了顿，道： “ 只是，恐怕沈师兄今后偶尔会有灵气滞 涩，或者运转不灵的突发状况了。 ” 室内的其他三个人都颇为留意他的神色。 须知，对于修仙者而言，灵气运转滞涩是非常可怕的问题。尤其是高手对决，一不留神就 毙命了。殊不知，对于这个结果，沈清秋已经很满意了。 像他这样的人渣反派角色定位，中了无可解的奇毒，居然还能活下来，太给面子了。 就算知道和主角啪啪啪就能解毒，可他能吗？他能吗？哈哈哈哈 …… 岳清源叹道： “ 早知如此，我就不该下山。 ” 沈清秋觉得他语气太过沉重，忙道： “ 仙盟大会本来就是各派掌门共同协商安排的大事， 师兄你不到场怎么能行？此次都怪魔界卑鄙狡诈，还有我自己不小心，师兄千万莫要往自 己身上揽。 ” 这里不把话说明白，依岳清源的性格，搞不好他一辈子再也不下山，死守苍穹山派都是有 可能的。谁知道那头，木清芳又愧疚道： “ 不，都是我不好。如果不是当时未能及时觉察 有魔界妖人入侵，又学艺不精，不能根治沈师兄，也不会至此。 ”“ 不不不，不关你们的 事。啊说起来我不小心用锤子把穹顶殿前面的地砸了个大坑 ……” 三个人稀里糊涂一阵乱劝，场面混乱又滑稽，害沈清秋又感动又尴尬，起了一身鸡皮疙瘩 ，头皮发麻。柳清歌面无表情望向窗外。等他们揽完责任了，才喝了一口茶，道： “ 此事 不可为十二峰主人之外的人所知。 ” 身为苍穹山第二峰的峰主，却有了这个致命的弱点，若被旁人悉知，那可不是好玩的。三 人自然明白。 岳清源问道： “ 清秋可会觉得峰主这担子过重？ ” 如果是原来的沈清秋，八成要怀疑岳清源想削权什么的。然而现在的沈清秋知道他是真心 担忧他过于操劳不利调养，忙道： “ 掌门师兄，你就别操心我了。我还不至于废到那个程 度。 ” 他笑了笑，又道： “ 我现在手足能行口能言，一身修为也都还在，满足得很。 ” 几人又谈了些魔族入山当日的细节，岳清源和木清芳便先一步离去了。目送走他们，沈清 秋好笑之余，又觉得说不出的温馨安定。 苍穹山这些同门们，虽然性格各异，有好相处的，也有不好相处的，但同气连枝。分居十 二峰，出了事却是能靠得住的一家人（不包括原装沈清秋）。 柳清歌放下早已冰凉的茶水： “ 若非你身上没有鬼气，我一定会怀疑你被夺舍了。 ” 留下来的这个，刚好就是不好相处的。 某种程度上，你的猜测是很正确的。 柳清歌继续道： “ 在灵犀洞中你救我，已经是匪夷所思。这次魔界偷袭，你又为了救门下 一名籍籍无名的弟子，险些丧命。中毒损及灵力，你本该气急败坏，却安然处之。这些事 谁做来都不奇怪，唯独你做来就乱套了。 ” 沈清秋一点也不想跟他讨论关于自己性格 OOC 的问题。他叫了明帆进来，换上新茶，往 后一靠，笑道： “ 籍籍无名？那也只是现在罢了。 ” 柳清歌道： “ 你那徒弟，根骨的确上佳。可这样的资质，每年各大门派挑出来的，不少， 最后真正能出类拔萃的，常常万中无一。 ” 沈清秋危机感顿生。 万一柳清歌成为了洛冰河开挂路上的绊脚石，两人正面对上，卡擦一下就被 KO 了怎么 办？为了大家都好，很有必要提醒柳清歌。 他苦口婆心道： “ 相信我，我这徒弟今后必定有所成，望柳师弟有机会能多多提携教导一 下他 ……” 明帆郁闷个半死。他只是去换一通茶水，却活生生被迫听了以往跟他同仇敌忾痛整洛冰河 的沈清秋讲了一堆大赞洛冰河的好话。其心塞之程度，唯有 “ 以往跟你一起狂喷小贱人的 闺蜜忽然和那些年你们一起掐过的小贱人成 CP 了 ” 可比拟。恶心得他决定立刻去恶心别 人。 明帆风风火火找到了厨房里正琢磨着明早给沈清秋做什么吃的洛冰河，劈头盖脸一顿破口 大骂，然后吩咐： “ 给我去砍柴！砍八十捆！堆满柴房！挑水！师兄弟们房里的水缸都是 空的你瞎了看不见吗？！ ” 洛冰河困惑道： “ 可是，师兄，柴房堆满了，我睡哪里？ ” 明帆单脚跺了跺地面，唾沫横飞： “ 这儿不是平的？不能睡？！ ” “ 师兄们房里的水缸我今天才刚打满 ……” “ 那水不新鲜了，重打！通通重打！ ” 如果是在以前，洛冰河心里可能还有点委屈或者悲愤，可如今他的心态大大不一样了。 在他眼里，这些都是对他的历练。 他已经有一个这么好、事事都为他着想，连性命都能为他豁出去的师尊（ …… ），还有什 么历练不能接受？还有什么苦头不能吃？ 洛冰河二话没说，立刻转头就准去做。 明帆看到他这个样子，一点欺负人的快感都没有，反而更心塞了。 他边走边骂骂咧咧道： “ 真不知道这个臭小子哪根筋入了师尊的眼，师尊忽然就对他另眼 相看了。什么必有所成什么出类拔萃！就算师尊被这臭小子灌迷魂汤了，柳师叔也不会提 携他的，教导他，想都别想！我呸 ……” 他虽然边走边嘟哝着骂，声音不大，可飞速进步又天生五感灵敏的洛冰河哪会听不到。明 帆嘟嚷的虽然是残言片语，可基本把关键词点了出来，洛冰河一下子就把情景猜了个七七 八八。 原来师尊在柳师叔面前，是这样说自己的 …… 在自己看不到的地方，有一个人这么看重自己，这种感觉，实在是非常奇妙。 一股暖流蓦地用上心头，越涌越汹涌，渐渐地包裹了整个身体。 洛冰河仿佛感觉出一股坚定的力量在心底某个地方生了根，开始发芽，连握着笨重木水桶 的手也更加有力了。 此时，洛冰河不但没有被刁难的自觉，反而露出这种幸福又满足的表情。 如果沈清秋在这里，他一定会怀疑，洛冰河内心深处其实是个抖 m…… 不过，沈清秋打死也不会知道，由于神助攻的猪队友明帆同学，洛冰河的好感度又被刷出 了一个新高。此时的他正美滋滋地躺下。 今天，一向高冷的清静峰几乎门槛都被踏破了。各峰主人都带了弟子和慰问品来探病。 毕竟纱华铃挑衅之时，虹桥被斩断，穹顶峰被结界隔绝，他们未能及时赶到现场，一场恶 斗全让沈清秋一个长辈给扛了，好歹苍穹山没丢太大脸。无论以往交情好或是不好，都必 须来表示一下。沈清秋坦然受礼，还趁机把没见过面的几位峰主的脸也认了，顺便寒暄一 阵，拉近关系。 晚上，他美滋滋地想：总算是可以安心睡个好觉了。 两个时辰之后。 …… 安心睡个屁！ 沈清秋站在一片混沌虚无的空间之中，沧桑地眺望远方望不到边的地平线。 他之前明明含着欣慰的笑容，在自己床上舒舒服服坠入了梦乡，谁能解释一下，为什么他 会被拉进这个空间？！ 沈清秋真恨不得弄个锣来，给敲一敲系统就会自己出来，也用不着总是在脑子里扯嗓子喊 了： “ 系统？在线不？ ” 系统：【系统为您提供 24 小时服务。】 沈清秋： “ 这是哪儿？什么情况？ ” 系统：【这里是梦境之地。】 沈清秋： “ 我当然知道这里是梦境。现实里你弄这么抽象派的景色给我看看？我问的是为 什么我会在这儿。 ” 拜托，千万不要是他所想的那样。 可这个世界的神实在太不给他面子了，他刚想着不要不要，下一秒，他就看到了一个再熟 悉不过的身影。 洛冰河茫然地站在前方一片荒原的中央。 他也像完全不知道为什么自己会出现在这里，片刻茫然过后，忽然眼里出现了沈清秋的身 影。他一怔，立刻像见到母鸡的小鸡（什么鬼比喻），欢欢喜喜地跑了过来。 “ 师尊！ ” 他已经被困在这个世界好久了，看到沈清秋出现，一时激动，一连叫了好几声。 沈清秋一看到他，就知道这里是什么地方了、什么剧情了。 霎时，沈清秋万念俱灰，泪洒心田，拍了拍他的肩： “ 听到了，不用叫那么多声。 ” 洛冰河忙道： “ 是。师尊。您怎么也在这儿？您知道这里是哪里吗？ ” 沈清秋偷懒，原样照搬系统的台词： “ 这里是梦境之地。 ” 洛冰河又问道： “ 那我为什么会在这儿？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 谁在这里都可以奇怪，只有你在这里是理所当然。这里是你的梦境。 ”,"CHAPTER 15: NIGHTMARE INSTANCE The so-called protagonist’s privilege, was that even if he stepped in dog shit, there would be a hidden scroll or elixir inside, probably. As Shen Qingqiu flashed back on this segment, his facial expression kept changing erratically. He failed to notice even when the others addressed him; Yue Qingyuan had to repeatedly call him many times, before he finally returned to himself. “What?” Mu Qingfang passed him a piece of paper. “Continuously take these four medications daily, then circulate your spiritual energy with someone who has high quantities of it; they will assist you in maintaining regular spiritual circulation, then it shouldn’t be a problem. After pausing for a moment, he said, “It’s only, I’m afraid from today onwards, occasionally there will be situations that suddenly arise where Shen-shixiong’s spiritual qi will stagnate, or your circulation will malfunction. The other three people in the room all paid close attention to his expression. One must remember that to cultivators, the stagnation of your spiritual circulation was an incredibly terrifying problem. Especially in a duel between experts, where a single slip in attention would mean your life. Little did they know, Shen Qingqiu was already very satisfied with this result. For this kind of scum villain role, to be hit by a poison like Without-A- Cure and still continue living, it was already giving him too much face. Even if he knew that papapa with the protagonist could cure the poison, could he do that? Could he? Hahahaha… Yue Qingyuan sighed and said, “Had I known this, I should not have left the mountain.” Shen Qingqiu thought his tone was too serious, and hurried to say, “The Immortal Alliance Conference has always been a big event the various sect leaders work together to organize; Shixiong how could you not be there? This time was due to the demons’ underhandedness and deceitfulness, as well as my own carelessness; Shixiong must not hold yourself responsible.” If he didn’t say it clearly here, with Yue Qingyuan’s personality, he might never leave the mountain ever again, stay and defend Cang Qiong Mountain Sect to to his last; this was all possible. Who’d known that Mu Qingfang would then also guiltily say, “No, the fault is all mine. If it weren’t for me failing to realizethere was a demonic invasion, as well as my skill being too poor, unable to fully cure Shen-shixiong, it wouldn’t have become like this either.” “No no no, it has nothing to do with you two. Ah, thinking about it I wasn’t careful and smashed a giant hole into the ground in front Qiong Ding Hall with the hammer…” The three of them devolved into jumbled urging, the scene both chaotic and comical, causing Shen Qingqiu to be both touched and embarrassed, his entire body breaking out into goosebumps and his scalp going numb. Liu Qingqiu stared out the window, face expressionless. He waited until they finished blaming themselves, then finally took a sip of tea and said, “This matter must stay unknown to anyone outside the twelve Peak Lords.” To be Cang Qiong Mountain Sect’s second peak’s Peak Lord, yet have such a deadly weakness, if outsiders became aware, it would not be fun. All three of them naturally understood. Yue Qingyuan said, “Does Qingqiu think the burden of Peak Lord too heavy?” If it was the original Shen Qingqiu, he’d most likely suspect Yue Qingyuan of trying to reduce his authority, something of that sort. However the current Shen Qingqiu knew that he was genuinely worried about him overworking and damaging his health, so he rushed to say, “Zhangmen-shixiong, really, don’t worry about me anymore. I haven’t been crippled to that extent yet.” He gave a smile, then said, “Right now, my hands, feet, and mouth still work, and I still have my cultivation; I am plenty satisfied.” They then discussed several details of that day’s demon invasion, before Yue Qingyuan and Mu Qingfang took their leave first. Shen Qingqiu watched them go, thinking it all terribly funny, yet he also felt an unspeakable warmth and peace. His fellow disciples of Cang Qiong Mountain, even though their personalities were all different, with some easy to get along with, some difficult to get along with, but they all breathed as one. Though split into twelve peaks, whenever something went wrong they were a dependable family (not including the original Shen Qingqiu). Liu Qingge put down his tea; it had long gone ice-cold. “If it weren’t for your body’s lack of ghostly qi, I would definitely suspect you’d been possessed.” And this one who remained, just happened to someone difficult to get along with. On a certain level, your guess is very correct. Liu Qingge continued, “You saved me in Ling Xi Caves; that’s alreadyinconceivable. During the demon ambush this time, you also rescued a nameless disciple, and almost lost your life. You were poisoned to the point of damaging your spiritual energy levels, and should be furious, yet you peacefully accepted it. Others doing so wouldn’t be strange, but you doing so upturns everything.” Shen Qingqiu absolutely didn’t want to discuss the issues of his own OOC personality with him. He called Ming Fan, changing the tea, then leaned back and smiled, saying, “Nameless? That’s only for now.” Liu Qingge said, “That disciple of yours, his base is indeed excellent. However, a fair amount with this level of aptitude are picked by the large sects every year, and in the end the number who can become truly outstanding, is not even one in ten thousand.” Shen Qingqiu suddenly sensed danger. What if Liu Qingge became a stumbling block on Luo Binghe’s journey to becoming overpowered, and during a confrontation between the two of them, was KOed in a snap? For everyone’s sake, he needed to warn Liu Qingge. He patiently and earnestly said, “Believe me, this disciple of mine will definitely be successful; I hope when Liu-shidi has the chance, you can frequently give him a little support and guidance…” Ming Fan was half-dead from depression. He only went to change the tea, yet had been forced to hear Shen Qingqiu, his ally in torturing a common enemy, say a heap of good words about Luo Binghe, praising him. The level of suffocation he felt, was akin to “the confidante you cursed a little bastard with suddenly went and became a couple 76 with the same little bastard you’d tormented together over the years.” Repulsed, he immediately decided to be repulsive to others. A stormy Ming Fan found Luo Binghe in the kitchen, currently pondering over what food to make Shen Qingqiu the next morning, and showered him with verbal abuse, before commanding, “Go chop some wood! Chop eighty pieces! Fill the entire woodshed! Fetch water! The water jars in our rooms are all empty are you blind can’t you see?” Luo Binghe said, perplexed, “But, Shixiong, if the woodshed is full, where do I sleep?” Ming Fan stomped his foot, spittle flying everywhere. “Isn’t it flat here! Can’t you sleep here?” “I just filled the water jars in the shixiongs’ rooms today…” “That water isn’t fresh anymore, redo it! Redo them all!” If this was the past, there still might have been some grievances orbitterness in Luo Binghe’s heart, but today his attitude was completely different. In his eyes, these were all training experiences for him. He already had such a good Shizun, one who thought of everything for him, who was even willing to sacrifice his life for him (…); what training could he not take? What suffering could he not withstand? Luo Binghe didn’t say another word; he immediately turned to get ready to work. Seeing him like this, Ming Fan couldn’t derive even a little satisfaction from the bullying, and instead felt stuffier. He walked while cursing, “I really don’t know what part of this brat caught Shizun’s eye, for Shizun to suddenly see him in a new light. What “will be successful” what “become outstanding!” Even if that brat’s fed Shizun some bewitching potion, Liu-shishu still won’t guide or support him; don’t even think about it! Bah!” Even though he was cursing the entire time as he walked, his voice wasn’t loud, but how could Luo Binghe, with his blindingly fast progress and naturally sharp five senses, not hear. Even though all Ming Fan had muttered were harsh words and phrases, on the whole he’d touched on the keywords, so within an instant Luo Binghe guessed in bits and pieces, most of the picture. So Shizun actually spoke about him like this in front of Liu-shishu… Having someone talk about you in a place you couldn’t see, this sort of feeling, was truly very wonderful. A flow of warmth suddenly surged in his heart; the more it surged the stronger it became, gradually wrapping around his entire body. Luo Binghe felt like a steady strength had taken root somewhere in the depths of his heart, starting to bud; even his hand carrying the heavy wooden bucket seemed to become stronger. At this time, not only did Luo Binghe not feel like others were making things difficult for him, he even showed a joyful and satisfied expression. If Shen Qingqiu was here, he would definitely suspect, that within the depths of his heart, Luo Binghe was actually an extreme masochist 77 … However, Shen Qingqiu was completely unaware 78 , that thanks to student Ming Fan the useless teammate’s divine assistance, Luo Binghe’s favor had again risen to a new high. Right now he was elatedly lying down. Today, the always-lofty Qing Jing Peak’s doorstep almost broke from all the stamping. The various peak masters all brought their disciples to visit. After all, during Sha Hualing’s provocation, the Rainbows Bridges hadbeen severed, and Qiong Ding Peak had been sealed off by a barrier; they were unable to arrive at the scene, and so the burden of the fight had fallen on Shen Qingqiu as one of the older generation; anyhow Cang Qiong Mountain didn’t lose too much face. No matter if their past relationship had been good or bad, they absolutely had to come express some sentiments. Shen Qingqiu calmly received their greetings, and used the chance to learn the faces of several Peak Lords he hadn’t met before, while conveniently making some small talk and strengthening relationships. That night, he elatedly thought, finally I can have a peaceful night’s sleep. Four hours later. Peaceful night’s sleep my ass! Shen Qingqiu stood in the middle of a stretch of chaotic nothingness, and somberly stared out at the endless horizon. He’d plainly just been full of satisfied smiles, comfortably sinking into slumber in his bed; could someone explain why he’d been dragged into this space? Shen Qingqiu really wished he had a gong, one he could ring to summon the System, so he wouldn’t need to always yell at the top of his lungs within his mind, “System? Are you online?” The System: The System provides you with 24-hour service. Shen Qingqiu: “Where is this? What’s the situation?” The System: This is the world within a dream realm. Shen Qingqiu said, “Of course I know this is a dream realm. Show me how such abstract scenery can exist in reality? I’m asking why I’m here.” Come on, please don’t let it be what he’s thinking. But this world really didn’t give him any face; he’d just thought, don’t don’t, and the next second, he saw a figure that was incomparably familiar. Luo Binghe stood before him, bewildered, in the middle of a stretch of wasteland. He also seemed completely lost about why he’d appeared here; after a moment of bewilderment, suddenly Shen Qingqiu’s form came into view. He startled, then immediately ran over happily, like a chick who’d seen its mother hen (what shitty simile is this). “Shizun!” He’d already been trapped in this world for a long time; seeing Shen Qingqiu appear, he became momentarily excited, and called repeatedly many times. As soon as Shen Qingqiu saw him, he knew what place this was, and whatscenario this was. Instantly, all of Shen Qingqiu’s hopes turned to dust, a shower of tears raining down on his heart, and he patted Luo Binghe’s shoulder. “I already heard, no need to call that many times.” Luo Binghe hurried to say, “Yes. Shizun. How come you are also here? Do you know where this is?” Lazy, Shen Qingqiu directly copied the System’s lines. “This is the world within a dream realm.” Luo Binghe asked again, “Then why am I here?” Shen Qingqiu said, “Anyone else here can find it strange, but only your presence is natural. This is your dream realm.”"
洛冰河愣住了： “ 我的？ ” 他退了一步，看着无边苍凉之意的天地，喃喃道： “ 我的梦境，居然 …… 是这样的吗？ ” 境由心生。他小小年纪，心境不是花红柳绿，竟是如此景象，实在不能不感慨。 沈清秋装模作样思忖片刻： “ 这不是普通的梦境。恐怕你在不知不觉中被人动了手脚。梦 境中灵力波动强烈而不稳，为师是无意间被你拉进来。 ” 洛冰河面露惭色： “ 弟子不中用，又连累师尊。 ” 他凝神细思： “ 究竟是何人会对我的梦境 做手脚？ ” 沈清秋充分体验了一把剧透党的乐趣，直接戳破谜底： “ 不必多想。这梦境边缘有魔气翻 腾，手段又这么不入流，是魔族的人无疑。 ” 洛冰河闻言，并不吃惊，只是又被激起了对魔族的仇恨，道： “ 魔界妖人行事果然歹毒。 ” 真不知道洛冰河日后得知自己魔族混血身份的时候，想起自己说过的这句话，会是什么表 情…… 沈清秋笑了笑，道： “ 歹毒倒未必，说不定，人家是相反的心思呢。 ” 上帝视角说的话，旁人往往理解不能。洛冰河不明白，什么叫相反的心思？但沈清秋笑得 意味深长，句尾飘飘地上扬，捎带几分轻浮之意，有些味道使人心猿意马。到此为止，洛 冰河便没敢往下细想。 沈清秋其实一点也没有轻浮的意思，他觉得自己很正直。对洛冰河的梦境动手脚的，正是 纱华铃。其中自然有害人的心思，但更多的成分，大家都懂的，自然是有女怀春芳心暗 动。 不然为什么不害别人，单只害他呢？对于魔族妖女而言，喜欢的人，就是要拿来狠狠欺负 的。欺负不死她才服气，死了便太没用了，没啥好留恋的。 “ 这梦境大不简单。寻常的梦魇之术，困不住我，动动心念就能破除，可这个梦境，做的 着实精致。恐怕如果毁坏了幻境的核心，谁都没法出去。 ” 洛冰河急了： “ 即是说师尊会被永远困在梦境里？ ” 沈清秋看他一眼： “ 你也会。 ” 洛冰河心念一动，脸色忽红忽白： “…… 都是弟子不好。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 事到如今，多说无益，尽快设法，破除结界出去吧。 ” 洛冰河默然点头，跟在沈清秋身后，朝梦境边缘走去。 沈清秋面如波澜不惊，脑如惊涛骇浪，正与系统你来我往。 系统：【系统提示：您现在进入的是重要剧情支线：梦魔的结界。请保证此支线中，辅助 洛冰河战胜梦魔的幻境。否则将扣除 1000 爽度。】 又来了。又是扣爽度，每次都是这种让人看了要心肌梗塞的数字。我勤勤恳恳耕耘那么久 也挣不来几点爽度，你一扣就扣 1000 ，这样真的好吗？！做人 …… 不，做系统不要太绝！ 不过这也不是重点。重点是  剧本拿错了！ 让我们来看看这一段剧情的原定的前景提要：洛冰河被推入梦魔的攻击范围，危机之前为 求自保，出于本能，他拉了一个自己最信赖的人，一同进了结界。 沈清秋十万火急敲打系统： “ 大大，，！你确定没出 Bug ？这段洛冰河可是要泡 妹子的。而且妹子要负责帮他解开心结，用爱帮他战胜心魔，怎么我现在就直接替了这戏 份？！说好的情深意重心灵交融的收后宫呢？说好的不离不弃生死相依的小师妹呢？！ ” 系统：【自我检测未发觉 Bug 。系统运行正常。】 没有 Bug ，就是说这段剧情，要么走好，要么死。 蝴蝶效应啊！ 本来被洛冰河一起拉进梦魇中的应该是宁婴婴。作为前期在清静峰上洛冰河最近亲最信赖 的人，这个闯关 + 刷亲密度的任务明明是她的活儿。 现在怎么回事？ “ 最信赖、最亲近的人 ” 这顶帽子，怎么就莫名其妙地扣到了自己头上？ 沈清秋表示很受宠若惊但一点也不想接受此等殊荣。 洛冰河见沈清秋神色莫测，关切地问道： “ 师尊，怎么了？ ” 沈清秋立刻收神，镇定道： “ 没怎么。为师在想，操纵梦境的魔物善于攻击人心脆弱之处 ，你须得提防警惕。 ” 洛冰河点头，神色坚定地道： “ 弟子绝不再让师傅受到牵连。 ” 太苦逼了。不仅被卷入了危险剧情，而且，恐怕他必须要把妹子戏份的责任也担过来了。 沈清秋一点都不想跟着男主闯刀山火海面对口怕的梦魔大大顺便帮他挡刀以及做免费的心 理辅导啊 …… 话说回来，埋怨无益。以往他遇到这种情况总会习惯性地喷一喷向天打飞机，可想想，飞 机菊苣也很无辜哇。人家作为一个根正苗红的种马文写手，肯定也不愿意文章里出现这种 情况，好端端的妹子被换成了人渣反派，多糟心。普通读者都要摔书了。 两人前行，头顶云空和身边景色如同万花筒一般，时而拉长扭曲，时而破裂成万千碎片， 变幻莫测，他们走在这个世界里，画面极其诡异，就像人是达芬奇画的，背景是毕加索画 的，画风不同违和感不是一般的强烈。 忽然，黑压压的云层里，现出了一座城池的楼角。 两人停下脚步，洛冰河看向沈清秋，等他示意。沈清秋沉吟道： “ 兵来将挡，水来土掩。 进。 ” 走到城门口，洛冰河仰头望着，表情微微见迷惑。 沈清秋心知肚明，他是觉得这座城看起来很熟悉。 当然熟悉，这就是洛冰河幼年时期流浪的那座城。 城门前自然没有士兵把守，自己缓缓打开，沈清秋带着他走了进去。 这梦境真实到可怕，抽象时抽象得像几团色块，写实时又与现实毫无二致。城里的大路、 集市、民宅、小摊，无一不精致得令人发指。灯火通明，人来人往，远远看着，似乎热热 闹闹的，可走近一看，饶是沈清秋早有准备，还是心里打了个突。 这些活动的 “ 人 ” ，全部都没有脸孔。 他们的脸，只是糊糊的一团，看不清五官，也没有声音。根本不像是活人，却还在忙忙碌 碌地穿梭游走，整座城静如死寂，呈现出一种诡异的繁华。 洛冰河从未见过这种景象，骇然道： “ 师尊，这些是什么东西？ ” 沈清秋有点的慌，但还是负担起了解说小百科的职责。 “ 这是利用梦魇制造出来的幻影城。在梦境中，诸如房屋树木的死物可以制造，但活生生 的人却无法被制造出来，最多只能做成这样没鼻子没脸、口不能言的怪物。话虽如此，利 用梦境能造出一座城的规模，几乎以假乱真，恐怕也只有那个人了。 ” 洛冰河十分配合，虚心求教： “ 哪个人？ ” 沈清秋： “ 梦魔。 ” 梦魔，就是这场梦境副本里的 > 梦魔真身乃是魔族赫赫有名的一位高人前辈，在几百年前的一场天劫中被毁掉了肉身，强 大的元神却完好无损，从此寄生在旁人的梦境之中，靠吸取灵力和精气存活。 同时，他也是主角成魔之路上的启蒙导师之一。或者我们可以给他一个更直观亲切的称呼 ：随身老爷爷。 就是他，在洛冰河破除结界之后，俗套地和主角一见如故，俗套地把一身绝学倾囊相授， 俗套地从此以后时不时帮男主出个谋划个策解决点杂兵什么的。 洛冰河还想再多问几句，眼睛无意见在人群中一扫，却愣了一刹那。沈清秋明知故问： “ 怎么了？ ” 洛冰河脱口道： “ 脸！师尊！刚才我好像看到了有脸的人！ ” 沈清秋从善如流，言简意赅： “ 追。 ” 两人紧随那画风和旁人格格不入的几人其后，在城中七万八转，终于在一条小巷前停了下 来。 有脸的人，一共有五个。看着还是五个少年，个个有鼻子有脸，而不是模糊的一团，其中 四个高的围着地上的的一个，叫骂声不绝于耳，什么 “ 小杂种 ” 、 “ 王八蛋 ” 满箱子乱飞，根 本没注意到身后跟了两个人。 洛冰河道： “ 他们好像看不见我们。 ” 他看着沈清秋，仿佛在问，不是说梦魔无法制造有五官的人吗？ 又到开虐时间了！沈清秋心里叹息一声，道： “ 梦魔的确不能利用梦魇制造人，可这些 ‘ 人’ 不是他制造的。洛冰河，你仔细看一看他们的脸。 ” 洛冰河缓缓把目光移到他们身上，虽神色无大变化，须臾，却有一滴冷汗从额头滑落。 沈清秋道： “ 这些不是梦魔制造出来的幻影，他们是存在于你记忆里的真实人物的投影。 梦魔只把沉睡在你心底的这些影子唤醒了。 ” 洛冰河却已经听不到他的话了，举手覆在太阳穴上，似乎脑筋正在抽搐。 沈清秋知道，洛冰河的心魔，已经来袭了。 那四个流里流气的少年围着地上一个看起来只有四五岁大的孩子，拳打脚踢。那个衣衫褴 褛的孩子双手抱头，蜷缩在地上，一声不吭地挨打，真让人担心，这么小的孩子会被他们 活生生打死！ “ 嘿这没长眼睛的小杂种敢到哥儿几个的地盘上抢饭碗！ ” “ 活腻味了！ ” “ 踩踩踩！他不是可怜吗，不是没饭吃肚子饿吗，打死了也不愁没饭吃了！ ” 洛冰河头痛欲裂。 地上那个孱弱的小身影，那是过去年幼的他，从披头散发和满面血污里露出一双亮如星辰 的眼睛，两道利剑一般射来，和他对视。 洛冰河完全移不开目光。 沈清秋沉声道： “ 收神。幻像而已。 ”,"CHAPTER 16: WRONG SCRIPT PART 1 Luo Binghe startled. “Mine?” He backed up a step, looking at the endless, desolate land and sky, and murmured, “My dream realm, was actually… something like this?” The realm, one’s view of the world, reflected one’s heart. He was so young, yet his mind was not filled with the red of flowers and the green of willows, but actually scenery like this; one could not help feeling sorrow. Shen Qingqiu pretended to ponder for a while. “This is not an ordinary dream realm. I’m afraid that while you were unaware, someone tampered with it. The waves of spiritual energy within the dream realm are strong and unstable; this master was inadvertently pulled in by you.” An expression of shame appeared on Luo Binghe’s face. “This disciple is useless, and involved Shizun once again.” He considered carefully. “Exactly who would tamper with my dream realm?” Shen Qingqiu was fully experiencing the joy of giving spoilers, and got right to the answer. “No need to think too much. There’s demonic qi churning at borders of this dream realm, and to use such lowborn methods, it undoubtedly must be a demon. Hearing these words, Luo Binghe was unsurprised; they only aroused his hatred towards demons, and he said, “The ways of demons are truly poisonous.” He really didn’t know what sort of expression Luo Binghe would have in the future thinking back on these words, once he learned of his own mixed- demon heritage… Shen Qingqiu gave a smile and said, “Not necessarily poisonous, perhaps their thoughts are of the opposite.” Words that had been spoken from an omniscient perspective, outsiders could not understand. Luo Binghe didn’t understand, what did it mean, their thoughts were of the opposite? But Shen Qingqiu’s smile seemed profound, the tail of his sentence lightly inflected upwards, carrying a somewhat frivolous tone, with a hint of something that would cause people’s imaginations to run wild. Luo Binghe stopped here, not daring to think about it further. In actuality, Shen Qingqiu didn’t have any intention of being frivolous, he thought himself very straightforward. The one who’d tampered with Luo Binghe’s dream realm was Sha Hualing. Though she did have harmful intentions, everyone understood what she had even more, which was naturally,the secret yearnings of a young girl for love. Otherwise why did she not hurt others, and only hurt him? For demon women, they must viciously bully the person they like. Only if he didn’t die would she accept them, if he died that meant he was too useless, and not worth having lingering affections for. “This dream realm is rather complicated. An ordinary demon technique could not trap me; I can dispel those using only my thoughts; but this dream realm was truly meticulously made. I’m afraid that if the core of the illusion isn’t destroyed, no one will be able to leave.” Luo Binghe became anxious. “Even Shizun will be trapped in the dream realm forever?” Shen Qingqiu glanced at him. “You will be too.” Luo Binghe’s mind jolted, his face switching between red and white. “It’s all this disciple’s fault.” Shen Qingqiu said, “Things are already like this, so words are meaningless; we should think of something as soon as possible, dispel the barrier and leave.” Luo Binghe silently nodded, and followed behind Shen Qingqiu, heading towards the dream realm’s border. Shen Qingqiu’s face was smooth and without ripple, but his mind was a stormy sea; currently he was in a back-and-forth with the System. The System: System alert: you are now entering an important subplot scenario: Meng Mo’s 79 Barrier. During this subplot, please make sure to assist Luo Binghe in defeating Meng Mo’s illusion. Otherwise 1000 satisfaction points will be deducted. Here it was again. Again deducting satisfaction points, and every time it was this kind of heart-attack inducing number. After assiduously working for so long I’ve only managed to scrounge a couple of satisfaction points, while you remove 1000 in a single deduction, is this really fair? As a person… no, as a System you shouldn’t be so extreme! Although this wasn’t the main point either. The main point wasthis was the wrong script! Let us look at the summary of this scenario’s original setup: Luo Binghe had been pushed into Meng Mo’s range of attack, and before danger struck had sought protection instinctually, pulling the person he trusted most into the barrier with him. Shen Qingqiu urgently pounded on the System. “Master, Good Master,Esteemed Master 80 ! Are you sure there’s no bug? Luo Binghe should be cozying up with a maiden for this section. And the maiden is responsible for unraveling the complexes in his heart, using love to help him defeat his inner demons 81 ; how come I’ve been substituted into this role? Where is the promised, deep and emotional heart-to-heart where she’s accepted into the harem? Where is the promised little shimei who refuses to leave him, interdependent in life and death?” The System: Our self-inspection failed to find a bug. The System is running normally. No bug; that means that with this scenario, he either carries it out well, or he dies. This was the butterfly effect! Originally the one pulled along into Luo Binghe’s nightmare was supposed to be Ning Yingying. As Luo Binghe’s closest, most trusted person on Qing Jing Peak in the early stages, this gate-crashing, intimacy-building task was clearly her job. What was happening now? The hat of “closest, most trusted person,” how did it nonsensically land on his head? Shen Qingqiu acted very flattered and overwhelmed, but he didn’t want to accept this special distinction at all. Luo Binghe saw Shen Qingqiu’s unreadable expression, and asked in concern, “Shizun, what’s wrong?” Shen Qingqiu promptly pulled himself together, and calmly said, “Nothing’s wrong. This master was thinking, demons that manipulate dream realms often attack the human heart’s weaknesses; you must be vigilant and on your guard.” Luo Binghe nodded, his expression firm as he said, “This disciple will definitely not allow master to be dragged in again.” This was too miserable. Not only had he been drawn into a dangerous situation, on top of that, he even had to assume the task of playing out the maiden’s role. Shen Qingqiu absolutely didn’t want to charge through a mountain of knives or a sea of fire with the male lead and confront the terrifying Master Meng Mo, while also blocking knives for him and even providing free psychological coaching… That said, complaining was useless. In the past when he’d faced this kind of situation, his habit was to curse out Airplane Shooting Towards The Sky, butthinking about it, “Great Master” Airplane was also innocent. He was a proper and upright stallion novel author, and definitely wouldn’t have wanted something like this to happen in his work: a healthy maiden being switched out for a scum villain, how disheartening. Ordinary readers would be about to slam the book down. The two of them kept walking, the clouds above and scenery around them like a kaleidoscope, sometimes lengthening and twisting, other times shattering into thousands of fragments, erratic; the picture formed by the world as they walked through was extremely eerie, like if the people had been illustrated by Da Vinci, while the backgrounds had been illustrated by Picasso, the clash of styles not of an ordinary intensity. Suddenly, from the dense cloud layers emerged the buildings of a city. The two of them stopped their steps; Luo Binghe looked at Shen Qingqiu, waiting for his signal. Shen Qingqiu muttered to himself, “We appropriately deal with whatever situations that arise 82 . Enter.” Walking to the city gates, Luo Binghe raised his head to look, his expression becoming slightly puzzled. Shen Qingqiu knew very well, that he was thinking that this city looked very familiar. Of course it was familiar, this was the city Luo Binghe had wandered homeless in during his childhood. The city gates naturally had no guards defending them, and slowly opened by themselves; Shen Qingqiu led him inside. This dream realm was frightening in how real it seemed; when abstract it was so abstract that it became several blobs of color, when photorealistic it was so photorealistic it would have been impossible to reproduce. The city’s streets, markets, residences, vendor stalls, every single one was intricate enough to raise people’s hackles. Lit brightly with lamps, with people coming and going, from a distance it looked bustling and lively, but once he came close, even though Shen Qingqiu had long prepared himself, his heart still almost escaped his ribcage. These “people” who were moving, all of them were faceless. Their faces were just a blurry masses, their features unclear, and they made no sound. They didn’t seem like living people at all, yet they still bustled around, wandering back and forth; the entire city was deathly silent, creating an eerie sense of busyness. Luo Binghe had never seen a scene like this, and said, aghast, “Shizun, what are these things?”Shen Qingqiu was panicking a little from terror, but still took on the duty of an expository encyclopedia. “This is an illusory city created by using a nightmare. In the dream realm, inanimate objects such as buildings and trees can be created, but living people cannot; at most they can only be made to this extent, speechless monsters that lack noses and faces. Even so, to be able to create something on the scope of a city, and be able to blend the fake in with the genuine, I’m afraid it can only be that person.” Luo Binghe was incredibly impressed, and humbly sought instruction. “That person?” Shen Qingqiu: “Meng Mo.” Meng Mo, was this dream realm instance’s BOSS. Meng Mo’s true identity was that of a brilliant, famous, and outstanding elder among demons; several hundred years ago a bout of divine punishment destroyed his physical body, yet his powerful spirit was completely undamaged, and from then on he became a parasite within others’ dream realms, subsisting by absorbing their spiritual energy and vitality. At the same time, he was also one of the protagonist’s teachers on his road to becoming a demon. Or we could give him a more direct and intimate nickname: the Portable Grandfather. He was the one, who after Luo Binghe broke through the barrier, formulaically took a liking to the protagonist, formulaically taught him everything about his lost arts, and formulaically from that point forth would occasionally help the male lead think up plans for taking care of small fry. Luo Binghe still wanted to ask a few more questions, when his eyes involuntarily swept through the crowd, and froze for a split second. Shen Qingqiu asked despite knowing, “What’s wrong?” Luo Binghe blurted out, “Faces! Shizun! Just now I think I saw people with faces!” Shen Qingqiu readily heeded his words, and said concisely, “Chase.” The two closely followed behind the few who were incongruous with the people and style of the surroundings, turning and twisting throughout the city, until they finally stopped before an alley. In total, there were five people with faces. They appeared to be five youths, each one with noses and faces, not just blurry masses; four of them were tall and surrounded one who was on the ground, cursing and yelling incessantly, things like “little mongrel,” “bastard” flew around en masse; they completelyfailed to notice the two people behind them. Luo Binghe said, “It looks like they can’t see us.” He looked at Shen Qingqiu, as if asking, didn’t you say Meng Mo was incapable of creating people with complete features? Time for more abuse! Shen Qingqiu heaved a sigh in his heart and said, “Meng Mo indeed cannot create people using nightmares, but these people weren’t created by him. Luo Binghe, look more closely at their faces.” Luo Binghe slowly turned his gaze to them, and although his expression didn’t change much, in a flash, a drop of cold sweat dripped down from his forehead. Shen Qingqiu said, “These are not illusions created by Meng Mo; they are projections of real people from your memories. Meng Mo only awakened these reflections from the memories sleeping within your mind.” But Luo Binghe could no longer hear him; he placed his hands on his temples, and it seemed as if his head was twitching. Shen Qingqiu knew that Luo Binghe’s inner demons had already struck. Those four rowdy youths surrounded a child on the ground, who appeared to be only around four or five years old, and were punching and kicking him. That shabbily-dressed child had his head covered with both arms, and was curled up on the ground, soundlessly taking the beating; it really made one worry that such a young child would be beaten to death by them! “Heh, this little mongrel sure is blind, daring to enter our territory and snatch our food!” “Must be tired of living!” “Step on him, step on him! He’s pitiful, right, hungry with nothing to eat, right; beat him to death and he won’t worry about having nothing to eat!” Luo Binghe’s head hurt to the point of splitting open. That small, frail figure on the ground, was the young him from the past, and through the disheveled hair and bloodstained face, two bright eyes like stars, like sharp swords shooting forwards, met his gaze. Luo Binghe was completely incapable of moving his gaze. Shen Qingqiu said lowly, “Pull yourself together. It’s only an illusion.”"
然而，梦魔的可怕之处就在于他最擅长唤起人心最原始的恐惧或者愤怒、痛苦，击溃心理 防线。如果是开挂后的洛冰河，一万个梦魔加起来在他眼里也不过是不入流的小小伎俩， 可是现在的洛冰河，体内的魔族血脉尚未觉醒，已经深陷在灰暗的记忆与梦境之中。他所 能看到的，只是他的无能为力。 忽然，两人所在的小巷景象一阵扭曲，幻化成了另一处场景。 沈清秋心道不好，措手不及二连杀！ 这是一座破败的小屋，屋子里只有一张床，一张歪歪扭扭的小桌，桌上一盏昏暗的油灯， 一个小板凳。 床上躺着一名憔悴的老妇人，勉力想撑着身子坐起来，却始终不得力。门外冲进来一个小 小的身影。只十岁出头、面容稚嫩的洛冰河扶着妇人，脖子上还挂着那枚玉佩，急道： “ 娘亲，你怎么又要起来。不是说你休息就好吗？ ” 妇人咳嗽道： “ 躺着也没什么用啊 …… 倒不如起来把衣服给洗了。 ” 小洛冰河道： “ 我已经洗完了，娘躺着等我给你熬好药。吃了药，身子好了，再干活。 ” 那妇人面色灰败，早已病入膏肓，命不久矣。她笑着摸了摸洛冰河的头顶： “ 冰河真乖。 ” 小洛冰河扬起脸，强颜欢笑道： “ 娘想吃点什么？ ” 妇人道： “ 现在是越来越没胃口啦。 ” 顿了顿，犹豫道： “ 上次咱们家少爷倒的那个白色的 粥，倒是有点想尝尝，也不知道厨房还有没有剩的。 ” 小洛冰河用力点头道： “ 我去给娘亲问问！ ” 妇人再三叮嘱： “ 问问就成。没有剩的就随便弄点别的清淡的汤汤水水，能填肚子就成。 千万别向大师傅要。 ” 洛冰河满口答应，哒哒哒一阵风一样地跑出去。那妇人躺了一会儿 ，又从枕头下摸出针线，开始做女红。 屋子里的灯火越来越昏暗。洛冰河神思不清间，伸手想抓住点什么。沈清秋一把拽住他的 手，厉声道： “ 洛冰河！看清楚，这不是你的娘亲，你也再也不是那个任人折辱、无力还 击的孩子了！ ” 梦魇的杀伤之力，其一在于，受困之人心神越激动，神智受到的创伤就越大。像洛冰河现 在这样，极不稳定，对他的元神有很大危害。其二，必须要谨记，绝对不能攻击你梦境中 出现的 “ 人物 ” 。 所有的 “ 人 ” ，都是梦境宿主自身的意识和心神化成的，一旦你攻击他们，其实也就是在攻 击你自己的大脑。有许多人因不明此点，或控制不住自己的情绪，出手攻击了在梦境中伤 害过自己的 “ 人 ” ，从此陷入长眠。而如果洛冰河陷入长眠，沈清秋当然也要跟着一起被困 在他的梦里面。 四周景色变幻莫测。这个梦魇，就是他短短十几年人生中的坎坷和伤口大集合。忽而幻化 成小洛冰河求厨子赏他义母一碗粥吃，却被府上的小公子冷嘲热讽；忽而幻化成刚入清静 峰时，众师兄对他的排挤和刁难，单薄的身影吃力挥舞着生锈的斧头，扛着水桶在长长的 阶梯上越走越慢；唯一的宝贝玉佩被抢走，再也找不到 …… 错乱的一幕幕接连不断地堆积起来。此刻的洛冰河除了这些零散的画面和回忆，什么都看 不到听不清，唯有那些时刻的愤恨、绝望、痛苦、无助、狂怒，一股脑炸成一团，在胸口 和脑子里翻腾不息！ 唯一破解梦魇的办法，就是化解心结，如此自然梦魇不攻自破。可洛冰河拳头紧攥，指骨 喀喀作响，气息越来越不稳，两眼不正常地发红，若有若无的灵力流窜在周身，似乎攻击 欲在不断增强。沈清秋觉得，站在他身边真的很危险！ 沈清秋厉声道： “ 不要出手。即便打中了伤到的也是你自己！ ” 可洛冰河已经完全听不进他的话了。右手一抬，一道凌厉的暴击从掌中飞出，直削幻像里 恣意狂笑的几人！ 沈清秋心里哀叫一声，再怎么痛苦，身体还是很识时务地抢了上去，挡在幻像之前，生生 挡下了这一记暴击。刚好被打中小腹。 刹那间，沈清秋觉得好像被一只象腿踹中，两眼发黑。如果这里不是梦境，只怕一口凌霄 血早已狂喷不止 …… 不愧是主角！ 沈清秋泪流满面。明明才是个小弟子而已，为啥就能打出这么厉害的暴击？好像自从解冻 了OOC 功能，不但没什么伟大建树，反而除了挡刀啊就是挡刀还有挡刀，一直在做舍己 为人的好肉盾有木有！ 随着洛冰河这一记攻击，四周幻像被打破，人影和物件都如玻璃般裂成万千碎片。两人所 处的幻境化为一片偏僻的荒野山林。天幕深蓝，冷金的孤月高高悬于头顶。 洛冰河神智顿时清明。他先是对着站不住、单膝跪地的沈清秋愣怔不语，随后低头看了看 自己的掌心，还有一丝残留的灵力流转指尖，模模糊糊想起刚才他做了什么，脸色一下子 苍白起来。 洛冰河扑到沈清秋身边，扶着他，又急又悔： “ 师尊！你、你为什么不打回来！ ” 依沈清秋的灵力，完全可以直接还他一记暴击，两道灵力相撞，狭路相逢强者胜，不但能 化解洛冰河的攻击，还能反弹一记打回去。 沈清秋发至内心地说了一句 “ 傻孩子 ” ，有气无力道： “…… 本来为的就是不想你受伤。要 是打回来，伤到了你，还有意义吗？ ” 洛冰河听着他虚弱的声音，一掌拍死自己的心都有了： “ 可现在伤到的是师尊啊！ ” 与魔界那三场比试的事还没过去多久，就又让师尊为自己而受伤，这次还是被他亲手击 中！ 沈清秋见这孩子满脸的自责难过都快溢出来了，心有不忍，安慰道： “ 你我修为如何能比 肩？为师多挨几记也不打紧。 ” 洛冰河宁可沈清秋像以前那样恶狠狠地打他骂他出气，哪怕不理不睬冷嘲热讽，他心里也 舒服些，可偏偏沈清秋还这么闻声软语，让他呆呆地说不出话，简直不知道该怎么办才 好。 半晌，他低着声音说道： “ 都是我的错。 ” 前期洛冰河的确是走废萌温软小白花路线，沈清秋以为他又陷入了滥好人式的纠结和自我 反省中，耐心开导： “ 不关你的事。魔族行事偏激诡异，防不胜防。不过，如果你今后再 也不想遇上类似的事，变强吧。 ” 他此话纯属有感而发。这是一个弱肉强食的仙怪世界。变强，是保证不在这个世界随波逐 流、终成炮灰的唯一办法！ 洛冰河心念一动，没有说话，忽地抬头，双目定定凝视着沈清秋。 沈清秋心里咯噔一声。 洛冰河那双黑曜石般的眼睛，却闪着比星月倒影更夺目的光彩。 这…… 这种眼神！ 这种写满 “ 坚定的信念 ” 、 “ 燃烧的斗志 ” 的主角眼神！ 难道 …… 我已经成为了主角人生前进道路上的启明星？！ 洛冰河在沈清秋身侧正襟跪坐，铿锵道： “ 我明白了。 ” 等一下、你又明白什么了？能不能每次不要话只说一半？告诉我后面啊！ 他没注意到洛冰河这句话里并没有以 “ 弟子 ” 自称。洛冰河紧攥着拳头，一字一句道： “ 这 种事 …… 我绝不会让它再发生第二次。 ” 让师尊保护软弱无力的自己、让师尊为此而受伤 …… 这种事，绝对不会再有了！ 沈清秋 “ 唔 ” 了一声。 …… 怎么回事。忽然有一种 “ 被主角罩着好安心啊 ” 的感觉究竟是怎么回事？！ 安心个屁啊这个人今后是要把你削成人棍的你清醒一点！ 沈清秋五味陈杂。 妈的。本来嘛， “ 变强保护重要的人 ” 这一信念，应该是在主角见到为了帮助自己而受伤的 女主楚楚可怜、娇喘微微的模样后被激发的。系统这是 …… 把女主的戏份都加劳资身上来 了？,"CHAPTER 17: WRONG SCRIPT PART 2 However, the terrifying thing about Meng Mo was that he specialized in summoning the human heart’s deepest terror, rage, misery, to destroy people’s psychological defenses. If this was Luo Binghe after activating his god-mode cheats, ten thousand Meng Mos together would only amount to little parlor tricks in his eyes, but the Luo Binghe now, whose demonic blood had yet to awaken, was already trapped inside the dream realm and his dark memories. All he could see was his powerlessness. Suddenly, the alley scene they were became distorted, transforming into another scene. Shen Qingqiu thought, not good, a second killing blow without time to prepare! This was a broken-down little hut; the hut only had one bed, a crooked little table, with a dimly-lit oil lamp on top, and a small wooden bench. On the bed lay a haggard old woman; with great effort she tried to prop herself up, but from beginning to end, she was incapable of it. A tender-faced Luo Binghe, only a little over ten years old, supported that woman; around his neck still hung that jade accessory, and he anxiously said, “Mother, why are you getting up again. Didn’t we say it’s fine to rest?” The woman coughed and said, “Lying down doesn’t help with anything… might as well get up and wash the clothes.” Little Luo Binghe said, “I already finished washing; Mother, lie down and wait for me to finish simmering your medicine. You can work after you take it and get better.” That woman’s face was ashen, her sickness long beyond cure, with little time left to live. She smiled while patting Luo Binghe’s head. “Binghe is so sweet 83 .” Little Luo Binghe lifted his face, forcing himself to smile and said, “What does Mother want to eat?” The woman said, “These days I have less and less appetite. She paused, then hesitantly said, “Last time the white congee our house’s young master threw out, I do wish for a bit of a taste; I wonder if the kitchens have any left.” Little Luo Binghe vigorously nodded and said, “I will go ask for Mother!” The woman warned over and over, “Just asking is enough. If there’s none left then just make something light and soup-like, as long as it fills the stomachit’s fine. Absolutely do not request the chef for any.” Luo Binghe promised profusely, then ran out with a dadada, like the wind. After lying for a while, that woman felt beneath her pillow for a needle and thread, and started doing needlework. The lamplight in the hut became dimmer and dimmer. While Luo Binghe’s mind was unclear, he reached out, trying to grasp something. Shen Qingqiu grabbed his hand and forcefully said, “Luo Binghe! Look carefully, this isn’t your mother, and you are no longer that helpless child who can only take the humiliation!” One of the things that made the nightmare so lethal, was that the more agitated the trapped person became, the more damage it would do to their mind. The way Luo Binghe was right now, extremely unstable, was very harmful to his spirit. Another thing was that you needed to remember, you absolutely should not attack the “people” who appear in your dream realm. Every single “person,” was formed from the dream realm’s host’s own mind and consciousness; as soon as you attacked them, it would also be attacking your own brain. There were many people, who not knowing this, or who were unable to control their own emotions, would attack the “people” in the dream realm who’d hurt them before, and enter a coma from then on. If Luo Binghe fell into a coma, of course Shen Qingqiu would also be trapped in his dream with him. The scenery around them shifted erratically. This nightmare, was a collection of his misfortunes and traumas from his short decade-plus years of life. Suddenly it transformed into little Luo Binghe pleading with the chef to grant his adopted mother a bowl of congee, then being mocked and ridiculed by the manor’s young master; suddenly it transformed into the time right after he’d entered Qing Jing Peak, where he was subjected to his numerous shixiongs’ exclusion and spite, his frail form straining as he swung a rusty axe, carrying pails of water up the long stairs, steps getting slower and slower; his only treasured jade pendant snatched away, never to be found… The disordered scenes piled up as they came one after another without pause. The present Luo Binghe, other than these scattered images and memories, could neither see nor hear anything; within his head there was only an explosion of despair, suffering, helplessness, and fury from those times, churning incessantly within his chest and mind! The only way to dispel the nightmare, was to undo the complexes in one’s heart, causing the nightmare to collapse on itself. But Luo Binghe’s fists weretightly clenched; cracking noises came from his fingers, his breathing increasingly unsteady, his eyes turning an unnatural red, a faintly discernible current of spiritual power coursing around him, as if his desire to attack was constantly increasing. Shen Qingqiu thought, standing near him was very dangerous! Shen Qingqiu said harshly, “Do not attack. Even if you hit them, the one injured will be you!” But Luo Binghe could no longer hear his words. He lifted his right arm, and a powerful spiritual blast flew forth from his palm, to directly remove the people laughing freely within the illusion! Shen Qingqiu gave a cry within his heart, no matter how painful, his body still reacted and rushed over, putting himself before the illusions, blocking this spiritual blast head on. It just happened to hit his lower abdomen. In that instant, Shen Qingqiu felt like he’d been stomped on by an elephant, his vision going dark. If this weren’t the dream realm, he’d be vomiting an unceasing fountain of blood… As expected of the protagonist! Shen Qingqiu’s face was covered with tears. Luo Binghe was plainly only a young disciple, how could he release such a powerful spiritual blast? With this attack of Luo Binghe’s, the illusion around them was broken, the people and objects all shattering like glass into thousands of shards. The illusory landscape around them transformed into a remote, forested wilderness. The sky was a dark blue; the lone, cold golden moon hung high above their heads. Luo Binghe’s mind immediately cleared. He first stared blankly and speechlessly at the half-kneeling Shen Qingqiu, who was unable to stand, then lowered his head to look at his own palm, where a shred of remaining spiritual power was still flowing through his fingertips; vaguely remembering what he’d just done, his face immediately turned stark white. Luo Binghe threw himself to Shen Qingqiu’s side, supporting him, both worried and regretful. “Shizun! Why, why didn’t you hit back!” With Shen Qingqiu’s level of spiritual power, he was wholly capable of returning the spiritual blast, colliding both of their spiritual power together, directly pitting them against each other with the stronger one winning; not only could he dissolve Luo Binghe’s attack, he also could have deflected it back at him. Expressing his innermost feelings, Shen Qingqiu said a single, “Foolish child,” then spoke weakly, “The entire point was so you wouldn’t get injured. IfI deflected it back, injuring you, what meaning would there be?” Hearing that frail voice, Luo Binghe even wanted to strike his own heart and kill himself. “But now the one injured is Shizun!” It hadn’t been long since the incident with the three matches against the Demon Realm, and Shizun had already been injured for his sake again, and this time by his own hand! Shen Qingqiu saw how the self-blame and misery on this child’s face was about to overflow, and unable to stand it, said consolingly, “Can your cultivation compare with mine? Even if this master took several more blows, it wouldn’t matter. Luo Binghe would rather Shen Qingqiu be like in the past, vent his anger by viciously beating and cursing him; even if he was utterly ignored, scorned and ridiculed, it would still ease his heart, yet on the contrary Shen Qingqiu’s tone and words were so gentle, and so he was dumb and speechless, completely at a loss for what to do. After a long moment, he said in a low voice, “It’s all my fault.” The early Luo Binghe indeed walked the path of a brainless moe 84 white lotus; Shen Qingqiu thought he’d once again fallen into a people-pleaser’s conflict and self-reflection, and explained patiently, “It has nothing to do with you. The ways of demons are extremely unpredictable, and impossible to guard yourself against. However, if you don’t want to encounter something similar in the future, you should become stronger. These words of his were spoken purely out of his personal feelings. This was a world of immortals and monsters, where the strong ate the weak. Becoming stronger, was the only way to guarantee that you wouldn’t become cannon fodder pushed around by this world! Luo Binghe thoughts shifted, and without speaking, suddenly raised his head, fixing his gaze steadily on Shen Qingqiu. Shen Qingqiu’s heart gave a thump. Those obsidian-like eyes of Luo Binghe, flashed with a light more dazzling than the reflection of the moon and stars. This… this expression in his eyes! This kind of protagonist’s expression, full of “resolute trust” and “blazing fighting spirit!” Could it be… I’ve already become the protagonist’s guiding star on his life path going forwards? Luo Binghe fell into a proper kneeling position by Shen Qingqiu’s side,and said in a clear, strong voice, “I understand.” Wait, what did you understand this time? Can you not only say only half your words each time? Tell me the rest! He didn’t notice that within this sentence of Luo Binghe’s, he didn’t use “this disciple” to address himself. Luo Binghe tightly clenched his fist, saying word by word, “This kind of thing… I definitely won’t let it happen a second time.” To let Shizun protect his weak self, to let Shizun be injured because of it… this kind of thing, absolutely cannot happen again! Shen Qingqiu gave an “oh.” What’s going on? He suddenly had a “the protagonist is shielding me; I feel so safe” kind of feeling; what exactly is going on? Safe your ass, this person will carve you into a human stick in the future! Wake up a little! Shen Qingqiu was filled with a plethora of complex emotions. Fuck. Originally, this conviction of “become stronger to protect my important people,” should have been aroused by the protagonist seeing the female lead’s frail and lovely, delicately panting form, after she’d sustained an injury from helping him. This was the System… laying all labour and capital associated with the female lead’s role on him?"
这也能发错剧本！还有加戏敢不敢给派盒饭工作餐啊！？ 背着主角又臭又长的台词，拿着龙套又干又薄的工资。这是剥削劳工！ 出于私心，沈清秋勉力抬手，摸了摸洛冰河的头。本来目光倔强洛冰河愣住了，仿佛被一 清泉浇熄了隐隐窜动的怒意。 沈清秋想了想，道： “ 其实，也不必太在意。如果你没法变强，我会守在你身边保护你。 ” 真要让洛冰河成为日后那个以毁灭世界为己任的暗黑系蛇精病青年，倒不如他一直是这么 一朵楚楚可怜的小白花，沈清秋完全不介意把这样的他带在身边照顾一辈子。 他的想法是如此的单纯，落到别人耳朵里可就不是那么回事了。洛冰河已经完全呆住了。 从来没有人，对他许过这么直白又热切的承诺。 天下虽大，又有几个人能说，你不必变强啊，有我在，自然不会让你受欺负就是了？ 而且不是空话。师尊说做得到，就做得到。他已经数次用行动证明了，他宁可自己重创， 也不愿自己受到一丝一毫的损伤。 不过，这句话中的宠溺之感 …… 似乎太过了。最初那阵汹涌的暖意略略平息后，洛冰河的 脸迅速爬上一阵辣辣的热感。 沈清秋咳了一阵，痛苦地发现在梦境中咳不出血来，拧了拧他的手臂： “ 好啦。先扶我起 来。 ” 洛冰河觉得手腕上被拧过的地方不痛不痒，怪异的发麻，立刻觉察到心绪越矩，心底骂了 自己几句，都这时候了想些有的没的，真是对师尊大不敬。忙整顿心思，依言而行。 忽然，一个声音突兀地响起。那苍老声音 “ 咦 ” 了一声，奇道： “ 小子居然能冲破老夫的结 界，不简单。 ” 那声音自带回响，萦绕在两人四周，辩不出来从哪个方向发出的。 这一关的 BOSS 终于出现啦！ 洛冰河扶着沈清秋没有起身，目光警惕。梦魔在沈清秋受伤之时出现，可说情况大大的不 妙。他打定主意，如果梦魔要下杀手，即便力量绵薄，也要全力拖住对方，争取为沈清秋 争取一线生机。 他这个决心不过下了一瞬，那声音又说道： “ 你且过来，让老夫看看，是怎样的少年英雄 ，有这样的本事。 ” 洛冰河看着沈清秋。后者满脑子都是友情出演完毕可以收工了，甚为愉悦，还有心思逗逗 他： “ 人家前辈问的是你这位少年英雄，答个话？ ” 洛冰河涨红了脸，转身朗声道： “ 不敢当。破除结界，全属我师尊一人之力。 ” 那声音哼了一声，似乎甚为不屑。 沈清秋知道他为什么要哼。他虽然替洛冰河挡了一记攻击，可这是洛冰河的梦境，主要还 是靠洛冰河夺回意识的掌控权，才破除了梦魇。不过沈清秋也懒得插嘴辩解。 那声音道： “ 老夫让小子你过来，却不想让这苍穹山的一介凡修也听到你我的对谈，就让 他先睡上一觉吧。 ” 果然，和原作宁婴婴在时的情况一模一样，除了洛冰河以外的人，都会被梦魔挥退。沈清 秋一阵头疼，沉沉倒下。 洛冰河大惊，忙搂着他唤道： “ 师尊？师尊！ ” 梦魔道： “ 不必担心。老夫只是送他进入了梦中梦，睡得更沉了而已。你，快过来！ ” 这次 ，倒是能听出，声音是从西方一处黝黑的山洞里传来的。 洛冰河唤不醒沈清秋，将他轻轻平放在地上，转向那声音来处道： “ 我师尊称您一声前辈 ，我自是更要对您以礼相待，希望您也能不为难师尊。 ” 梦魔嘿嘿笑道： “ 小子，我看了你的记忆，你这个师尊对你也不算好，为什么不让我干脆 把他除掉？我这可是在帮你啊。 ” 他看的多半是以往的原装货沈清秋和洛冰河相处的记忆。那些记忆也的确占大多数就是了 …… 洛冰河摇摇头： “ 师尊并不是前辈你说的那样。况且再怎么样，师尊也是师尊，他如何对 我都可以，做弟子的却不能不敬。 ” 梦魔哼道： “ 迂腐！人界正道，都是这么个虚伪德性。管他师不师，尊不尊。但凡旁人欺 我害我，就该杀了！他明知你修为不足以应付天锤，却还派你上场，是何居心，你难道看 不明白？ ” 洛冰河道： “ 那时候，连我自己都不相信自己能赢。师尊却相信我，不但给我机会，更在 比试途中鼓励我。而最后，我也确实赢了。 ” 还有一句话，他只在心里默默地对自己说。 师尊为救我，替我挡了两次攻击。他待我，是真心好。 梦魔也就胡乱看了些片段，不了解沈清秋为人，也不想在这个问题上过多纠缠，但却对洛 冰河的态度大是满意： “ 小子倒是名重情重义之人。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 不及师尊待我万一。 ” 梦魔如果有嘴角，早就抽搐了。他决定换个话题。 沉吟片刻，梦魔道： “ 老夫感觉你身上，有一种被隐隐压制着的东西。虽然看不出来那究 竟是什么，但恐怕是极其了不得东西。 ” 洛冰河微微诧异： “ 什么东西，连您也看不出来？ ” 梦魔嘿嘿道： “ 我族能者辈出，有比老夫更杰出的魔族在你身上封印了什么，也不是不可 能的事。 ” 梦魔总不至于几百年的老脸不要，跑来骗他这个一穷二白两袖清风十几岁的少年。洛冰河 不可置信道： “ 前辈的意思是，我身上的东西 …… 和魔族相关？ ” 梦魔哂笑： “ 怎么？不乐意了？急着要和魔族撇清吗？ ” 洛冰河的震惊并没持续太长时间。他的心思回转的极快，强硬地道： “ 魔界作恶多端，多 次伤我师尊，我自然是绝不能与他们有瓜葛。 ” 梦魔郁闷： “ 小子，你敢不敢不要三句不离你那师尊？老夫猜，你下一句就要问，敢问前 辈，是否有把它从我身上除去的办法了吧？ ” 洛冰河苦笑道： “ 就算我问，前辈会告诉我吗？ ” 梦魔哈哈大笑： “ 这倒不是我不想告诉你。而是老夫也实在无能为力。连看也看不真切， 又谈何除去？要不是对你这小子捉摸不透，早也将你们两个一并杀了，哪有兴味牵扯上这 半天。你当老夫很清闲吗？ ” 洛冰河不说话。 他想，你实体都没了，只是一团寄生在别人梦境里的虚影而已。你不清闲谁清闲？ 梦魔不知道他在腹诽自己，又道： “ 除掉我是无能为力，不过，压制却不是没有办法。 ” 洛冰河试探着问道： “ 前辈，愿意把方法告知于我？ ” 梦魔诱导道： “ 老夫不光可以教导你压制他的方法，而且，还能教导你更多。 ” 这暗示十分露骨，洛冰河听明白了。他一颗心沉下去： “ 你要我修魔？ ” 听他语气转冷，梦魔有点火光： “ 修魔有什么不好？若你能修魔，你身上那一层东西，将 于你的修为有大大裨益，一日千里！凌驾万人之上，绝非空谈，假以时日，纵横三界翻天 覆地所向披靡，绝不在话下！ ” 听到最后一句，洛冰河心中一动。 一日千里，万人之上，纵横三界，所向披靡。简而言之 …… 强，最强！ 很快，他否决了这个念头。 沈清秋最是憎恶妖魔一路，如果自己禁不住这梦魔的诱惑入了魔道，该怎么面对他？无论 沈清秋是雷霆大怒，或是黯然伤神，自己想绝不想看到。 “ 不行。 ” 洛冰河断然拒绝。 梦魔冷笑： “ 你如果不肯跟我学，恐怕压制不了你身上的魔气。现在潜藏的深，看不出来 倒还好，可老夫感觉得出来，你身上的封印在变弱。等它有朝一日破封印而出，你那嫉恶 如仇、以除魔卫道为己任的好师父，会怎么对你？ ” 提及洛冰河最顾忌之事，他咬了咬牙，道： “ 晚辈只是一介小小凡修，连筑基都千难万险 ，你又何必非要强逼我修魔不可？ ” 这个问题问得太有水准了。除了作者，谁也搞不清楚，究竟为什么所有的奇人高人都总是 哭着喊着要主角做他们的徒弟 / 传人 / 女婿。 不，其实，大概连大多数作者也未必知道这个千古之谜的答案。 “ 小子莫要不识抬举！老夫看你身负奇状，不愿一身绝学随我肉身烟消云散，多少人求也 求不来！ ” 洛冰河面无表情。梦魔见他不接话，忽然涌上一股不祥预感。 果然，洛冰河再开口时，带上了一丝纯良无害的笑容。 他慢条斯理道： “ 前辈这么急着要教我，恐怕不仅是因为不愿绝学后继无人吧？ ” 梦魔暗叫不好。 洛冰河道： “ 寄生于旁人梦境，如果时常更换宿主，元神会在腾转流离间被折损削弱，但 如果能长期寄居在一名固定宿主身上，则可养精蓄锐，稳固元神。 ” 他顿了顿，道： “ 梦魔前辈莫非已大限将至，才不得已要挑我作为宿主来培养？ ” 梦魔被他说穿，既不抵赖也不恼怒，反而大大方方承认了： “ 不错！没想到你这小子居然 也博闻强识，还知道这一点。 ” 梦魔见他神色淡定，琢磨不出这小子心思如何，接着说道： “ 不过你也不要以为老夫的宿 主就非你不可了。魔族天赋异禀者千千万，哪一个不跪下来求此殊荣！倒是你，可要好好 掂量掂量，能不能错过这个机会了。 ” 其实这些年来他的元神日渐衰颓，本来寄居于魔器之中，呆的好好的，静修个百八十年就 又生龙活虎了，偏偏不明就里的纱华铃阴错阳差把魔器当做武器投放到洛冰河身上，他已 经没有力气再去寻找下一个宿主了。 可绝路之中，居然发现新寄居的这小子体内和神识里都潜藏着一股若有若无强大力量，他 狂喜不已，哪能就这么放过？ 他已打定主意，不管洛冰河怎么严词拒绝，他软磨硬泡威逼利诱，用尽各种手段也要说服 他向自己修习魔族术法，让肉身和神识更适合他的寄居。 梦魔道： “ 老夫给你时间，仔细想清楚了。否则，把你和你师尊的神识永远困在梦境中， 这点老夫还做得到！ ” 洛冰河蓦地抬头，那一瞬间，梦魔被这个少年眼里一闪而过的寒光震慑住了。 洛冰河方才的平和谦顺全无，声音冰冷： “ 你现在是在和我谈条件，说什么都可以。但倘 若伤及师尊，一切免谈！ ” 梦魔怔了半晌，才回过神来，震惊于自己刚才居然被一个小小人界凡修的气势所慑的事 实。他纵横三界百年，就算是当初肉身损毁的那艰苦一战，也不曾在气势上为人所压。 他当然不会知道，这种气势，后世称之为（主角专属的）王霸之气！ 山洞中突然爆发出一阵哈哈大笑。 “ 你这小子，当真有点脾气！ ” 那苍老的声音说完这句后，洛冰河顿时觉得四肢沉重起来，四周景物天旋地转，陷入黑 暗。须臾，洛冰河从柴房中醒来，惊觉背心都湿透了。 与此同时，沈清秋也从床上诈尸一样地弹起来。 头晕目眩地喘了几十口气，他才终于缓了过来。,"CHAPTER 18: PORTABLE GRANDFATHER To hand out the wrong script even here! Also, if you’re giving me extra parts, offer me complementary meals? Taking on a main character’s long and tedious lines, while being paid an extra’s thin and meager wages. This is exploitation of labor! Out of selfishness, Shen Qingqiu managed to lift a hand and pat Luo Binghe on the head. Luo Binghe’s originally stubborn gaze froze, as if a handful of clear spring water had doused the flickering anger. Shen Qingqiu thought for a moment and said, “Actually, you need not worry too much. If you cannot become strong, I will stay by your side and protect you.” Instead of letting Luo Binghe become that pitch-black, basket case 85 of a young man who made destroying the world his mission, it’d be better if he could stay this delicate little white lotus forever; Shen Qingqiu absolutely would not mind keeping this kind of him by his side, and take care of him for a lifetime. His thoughts were this simple, but to the other person’s ears, it did not sound that way. Luo Binghe was already completely dumbfounded. No one had ever made such a straightforward and impassioned promise to him. Even though the world was large, how many people could say, you need not to become strong; I am here, of course I will not let others harm you? And they weren’t empty words. If Shizun said he could do it, he could. He had already proven many times with his actions, that he would rather sustain grievous injury than let Luo Binghe suffer a tiny bit of harm. Still, the sensation of coddling within these words… was too much. After that first surge of warmth slowly subsided, a burning heat instantly crawled up Luo Binghe’s face. Shen Qingqiu coughed for a while, miserably discovering that coughing up blood within the dream realm was impossible, then pinched Luo Binghe’s arm. “Alright. First, help me up.” Luo Binghe felt that where his wrist had been pinched neither hurt nor itched, and instead tingled; immediately he realized his thoughts were overstepping and scolded himself a little: thinking such nonsense at a time like this, how disrespectful to Shizun. He hurriedly organized his thoughts and did as he was told.Suddenly, a voice sounded out of nowhere. That hoarse, aged voice let out an “ehhh” sound, and said, “Boy, to actually break through this elder’s barrier, you’re quite something.” That voice came with an echo, hovering all around the two. It was impossible to determine which direction it came from. The BOSS of this level had finally appeared! Luo Binghe was supporting Shen Qingqiu and did not rise to his feet, his gaze wary. Meng Mo had appeared while Shen Qingqiu was injured, it could be said things were not looking good. He made the resolution, that if Meng Mo tried to attack, even with his meager strength, he would still give his all to impede him, and earn Shen Qingqiu any chance of survival. The instant after he made his decision, that voice spoke again. “Come over here and let this elder see, what kind of young hero is capable of such a thing.” Luo Binghe looked at Shen Qingqiu. The latter’s entire mind was full of, I finished my performance of friendliness, can finally leave work now, and so was extremely cheerful; he even felt like teasing him, “The senior is asking this young hero, why don’t you reply?” Luo Binghe’s face reddened; he turned and spoke with a clear voice, “You flatter me. Breaking through the barrier was due to my Shizun’s strength alone.” The voice hmphed, as if full of disdain. Shen Qingqiu knew why he’d hmphed. Though he had blocked an attack for Luo Binghe, this was Luo Binghe’s dream realm, and so required Luo Binghe to wrest back control over his consciousness, only then was the nightmare broken. But Shen Qingqiu couldn’t be bothered to explain. The voice spoke, “This elder wants you to come over here, boy, but I don’t want this ordinary cultivator from Cang Qiong Mountain to also hear our conversation, so I’ll let him sleep first.” As expected, the circumstances were exactly the same as when Ning Yingying was here in the original; everyone else from Luo Binghe would be waved offstage by Meng Mo. A headache came over Shen Qingqiu, and he collapsed heavily. Alarmed, Luo Binghe gathered him in his arms and called, “Shizun? Shizun!” Meng Mo said, “No need to worry. This elder only sent him into a dream within a dream, he’s just sleeping more deeply. You, get over here!” This time, it was possible to hear that the voice was coming from a pitch-black cave off to the west.Luo Binghe could not wake Shen Qingqiu; he carefully laid him on the ground, then turned and spoke towards where the voice was coming from, “My Shizun acknowledged you as a senior, so I must treat you with the same courtesy; I hope you also won’t cause Shizun trouble.” Meng Mo chuckled and said, “Boy, I saw your memories; this Shizun of yours does not treat you well, why not just let me get rid of him? I would be doing you a favor.” The memories he had looked at were mostly those of the original Shen Qingqiu’s and Luo Binghe’s interactions. Those memories were indeed the greatest in number, truly… Luo Binghe shook his head. “Shizun is not like you said, Senior. In addition, no matter what, Shizun is Shizun. He can treat me however, but as his disciple I cannot disrespect him.” Meng Mo humphed, “Small-minded! The Human Realm’s righteous path is full of this type of hypocritical morality. So what if he’s your honored or master or whatever 86 . If someone mistreats or harms me, they should be killed! He knew your cultivation was not sufficient to face Tianchui, yet he still sent you out for the match; can you not tell the kind of intentions he had?” Luo Binghe said, “At that time, even I didn’t believe I could win. But Shizun believed in me; not only did he give me the opportunity, he even encouraged me during the match. And in the end, I truly did win.” And a last sentence he silently said only to himself. To save me, Shizun blocked two attacks for me. His goodness towards me is genuine. Meng Mo had only randomly skimmed some fragments; he did not understand Shen Qingqiu’s behavior nor did he want to try unraveling this issue, though he was quite pleased with Luo Binghe’s attitude. “You, boy, are a person who values loyalty and bonds.” Luo Binghe said, “Not even a thousandth of how Shizun is towards me.” If Meng Mo had a mouth, its corner would be twitching. He decided to change the topic. After murmuring for a moment, Meng Mo said, “This elder senses that within your body, there is something being suppressed. Even though I cannot tell exactly what it is, it must be something incredibly remarkable.” Luo Binghe was a little shocked. “What sort of thing is it, that even you cannot tell?” Meng Mo chuckled and said, “My people produces masters in droves. It isnot impossible that a demon more illustrious than this elder had sealed something in your body.” In any case, Meng Mo was not so eager to throw away his several- hundred-years-old face, that he’d come and trick an impoverished teenager who had nothing. Luo Binghe said, still in disbelief, “Senior means, the thing in my body… is related to demons?” Meng Mo sneered. “What? Are you displeased? Eager to cut any connections with the demon race?” Luo Binghe’s state of shock did not last for too long. His thoughts whirred rapidly and he declared, “The Demon Realm does many evils of all kinds, and has injured my Shizun multiple times, naturally I cannot associate with them.” Meng Mo became depressed. “Boy, can you go three sentences without mentioning that Shizun of yours? Let this elder guess, the next thing you want to ask is, may I ask this senior, is there a method to remove it from my body?” Luo Binghe gave a wry smile and said, “Even if I ask, would this senior tell me?” Meng Mo laughed boisterously. “It’s not that I don’t want to tell you. But that there is truly nothing this elder can do. I can’t even see it clearly, how can I talk about removing it? If not for the fact that I couldn’t make sense of you, boy, I would have already killed you both, why would I care to drag it out for so long. You think I’m that idle?” Luo Binghe did not speak. He thought, you don’t even have a body anymore; you’re just a shade parasitizing on others’ dream realms. If you’re not idle, who is? Meng Mo was unaware that Luo Binghe was ridiculing him and continued, “Removing it is impossible for me, but suppressing it is not out of the question.” Luo Binghe asked tentatively, “Senior, is willing to tell me how?” Meng Mo lead, “Not only can this senior teach you how to suppress it, I can teach you much more.” This implication was extremely blatant, and Luo Binghe understood. His heart sank. “You want me to cultivate the demonic path?” Hearing his tone turn cold, Meng Mo’s temper flared. “What’s wrong with cultivating the demonic path? If you cultivate the demonic path, that thing in your body will bring great benefits to your cultivation, you could leap a thousand miles in a day! You could stand above the thousands; these are not empty words; some day, the entirety of the three realms, the heavens and earth within, could beoverturned and swept away before your power, and it would all be simple!” Hearing that last part, Luo Binghe’s heart jolted. A thousand miles in a day, stand above the thousands. The entirety of the three realms, swept away before him. That is to say… he’d become strong, the strongest! He quickly rejected this thought. Shen Qingqiu hated the way of demons the most. If he could not resist this Meng Mo’s temptation and became a demonic cultivator, how could he face him? Whether Shen Qingqiu would thunder in anger or sink into depression, he definitely didn’t want to see it. “No.” Luo Binghe resolutely refused. Meng Mo sneered. “If you refuse to learn from me, you won’t be able to suppress the demonic energy in your body. It’s hidden deeply now, and fine because it can’t be seen, but this elder can sense that the seal in your body is weakening. One day in the future, when it breaks through the seal, that good Shifu of yours, who abhors evil and makes eliminating demons and upholding justice 87 his mission, how will he treat you?” With Luo Binghe’s greatest worry pointed out, he clenched his teeth and said, “This junior is but an ordinary cultivator, for whom even achieving Foundation Establishment is full of perils and hardships. Why do you insist I cultivate the demonic path?” This question was really too high-level. Other than an author, who knew why all the great geniuses and masters were always crying and pleading for the protagonist to be their apprentice/disciple/son-in-law. No, in fact, even most authors probably didn’t know the answer to this eternal riddle. “Boy, you should appreciate others’ kindness! This elder can see that you are extraordinary. Would you rather all my knowledge vanish like smoke along with my physical body; how many people would beg for it without avail!” Luo Binghe showed nothing on his face. Seeing him refuse to reply, Meng Mo suddenly felt a rush of ominous premonition. Sure enough, the next time Luo Binghe opened his mouth, he did so with a pure and harmless smile. Slowly and composedly, he said, “That Senior is so eager to teach me, surely isn’t only because he’s unwilling for his knowledge to vanish without a successor, right?” Meng Mo cried to himself, not good."
惨惨惨。惨绝人寰！ 凭什么！凭什么原作里宁婴婴也是被梦魔扔进梦中梦去了，凭什么给她织的梦就是童年的 温馨回忆，爹爹妈妈给摘花花骑马马之类的，凭什么轮到他了就是先被拳头大的食人蜂包 围、再在狭窄的墓道里面狂奔、身后紧追着巨大的火球！ 最可怕的是梦中梦的最后，梦魔还给他织出了他最害怕的东西！ 阴暗潮湿的地牢中，他被一只圆环吊着腰，悬在半空，感觉不到四肢的存在。张口发不出 声音，无助地嗬嗬嘶叫。浑身上下都火辣辣地疼。 不知道在梦中过了多久，地牢外才传来石门开启的响动。不急不缓的脚步渐行渐近，一道 人影投射在前方地面上。 墨黑的袍脚用银线绣着精致的纹饰。从那人身上传来的冰冷威压，比地牢中密不透风的黑 暗更令人喘不过气。 沈清秋看不清那个人的脸。但他很清楚那个人是谁！ 梦魔不愧是魔族传说中的人物，这个梦境做得实在太逼真了。连空气中湿润的腐臭味都仿 佛还在他鼻尖，令人作呕。 沈清秋勉强坐了一会儿，真的翻滚下床，开始呕了。 叮咚。系统好死不死这时候弹出提示：【恭喜贵方完成 “ 梦魔的结界 ” 剧情线！系统奖励爽 度500 ！请再接再励！】 沈清秋比了个 “ 打住 ” 的手势，还有心情算账： “ 我们好好谈谈。你，威胁要扣爽度的时候 ，说的不是这个数吧？怎么不也设 500 ？罚多奖少真的好么？而且我多走了一个梦中梦的 剧情线，这个你为什么不算额外的 B 格给我？系统？系统！系统你别装死，我们来签一个 新合同！ ” 这时，有人一阵风一样闯开竹舍的门冲了进来。 “ 师尊！ ” 一听就知道是谁了。沈清秋痛苦地翻了个白眼。 他现在实在不想看到这位的脸啊！ 洛冰河已经扑倒他身边，紧张万分地问： “ 师尊，您怎么样？可有不适的地方？ ” 其实也还好 …… 如果您能离我远一点的话就更好了 …… 沈清秋别开脸，很有骨气和风度地自己站起来： “ 为师一切安好。 ” 洛冰河本来想扶他，却被自然而然地推开了手，不由愣住了。 沈清秋却没注意他这些小情绪，整了整衣物，确认只穿着中衣也无损形象之后，问道： “ 那梦魔后来为难你没有？ ” 为难个毛线。梦魔巴巴地跪舔洛冰河都来不及呢。沈清秋这是明知故问。洛冰河犹疑片刻 ，答道： “ 那位魔族前辈似乎灵力不支，后来弟子就被斥出梦境了。师尊你在梦中梦里没 遭遇什么吧？ ” 沈清秋大言不惭： “ 即便是遭遇了什么，为师还摆不平吗！ ” 当然，摆不平！ 他现在还残留着人棍的阴影，洛冰河靠的离他这么近，浑身都是毛毛的，不禁错开目光压 压惊。洛冰河不清楚其中缘由，见他神色古怪，眼光也不像以往坦然直视自己，心里焦躁 又忐忑。 好在沈清秋心态调整的极快，还记得作为师长，这时候该做什么。下一刻，就伸手抓住了 洛冰河的手腕，正色道： “ 被魔族侵袭可不是闹着好玩的。为师给你探查一番。姑息不 得。 ” 手腕被握住，洛冰河乖乖地道： “ 是。 ” 一颗心刚稍微放下，立刻又被吊起。万一沈清秋揪出了梦魔，而后者暴露了他身上的异状 …… 可沈清秋虽很是尽职尽责地给他检查了一番，却什么异状都没查到。自然检查不出什么东 西，人家梦魔好几百年的功力和鼎鼎大名绝无水分，但过场总归要走。沈清秋探查无果， 还是叮嘱洛冰河，明天去千草峰和穹顶峰让人看看，一旦出问题不能不说。 洛冰河却没有离去的意思，一副心事重重的模样，几番欲言又止，才问道： “ 师尊，魔族 …… 是不是都十恶不赦、应当斩尽杀绝？ ” 听到这个问题，沈清秋没有立刻答复。站在他的立场，确实也难以答复。 见洛冰河僵立原地，强作镇定又略带期待地等待着自己的回答，沈清秋还是缓缓地道： “ 人分好歹，魔族自然也有善恶之别。我们看到的总是魔族迫害人，却也未尝没有人类伤 害无辜魔族的事情发生。种族之见，你不要太过看重。 ” 洛冰河还是第一次听师长级的人物发表这种言论，怔怔听着，心砰砰狂跳： “ 师尊的意思 是，就算与魔族息息相关，也未必天地不容，是吗？ ” 沈清秋反问： “ 天地不容，从何说起？既然不容，为何要让它存在？容不容，谁说了算？ ” 一连串的反问下来，洛冰河的眼睛逐渐亮了起来，隐隐有热血沸腾之感。 最后，沈清秋道： “ 洛冰河，为师今后对你说的话，你可以听听就算。但是今天在这里对 你说的，你一定要牢牢记住。这世上，没有任何东西是不容于天地的。种族如是，人如 是。 ” 洛冰河这时虽然一心向正，却不是迂腐之人。横竖无计可消，倒不如善加利用。 他非变强不可！ 强到永远不会无能为力，强到可以从任何手中保护师尊。 看他双目熠熠生辉，沈清秋不知他心中所想，却是五味陈杂。 他这番劝导，并非纯粹是为了过一把主角人生导师超然智者的瘾。 虽然这是个老得不能再老的大道理，被古装剧武侠剧仙侠剧抱着翻来覆去炒冷饭轮了几十 年，半点长进没有，但是拿到这个人魔仇深似海不共戴天从古至今大战无数次的世界里来 ，却是极其标新立异、甚至冒天下之大不韪。 作为混血，洛冰河很难不受到这种观念的打击，甚至有过半生坎坷皆咎于此、自己不容于 世不容于天不该出生的自暴自弃。沈清秋希望从此刻起，这番话能在他心里埋下一颗种子 ，打开眼界，今后面对真相时看开点，面临旁人的血统攻击也不必耿耿于怀，也许行事就 不会那么偏激、一心想着报复社会了。 即便是日后面对着要把他踹下无间深渊的自己，也要明白，这不是他的错。 若能如此，即便剧情到来时，系统非逼着他说 “ 人魔不共戴天种族仇深似海鸿沟无法跨越 你他妈赶紧去死 ” 之类的台词时，被打脸打得飞起他也顾不得了！ 这里画风一转，沈清秋又觉得刚才自己有点装 B 过头，尴尬恐惧症快要发作，干咳一声： “ 话说回来，魔族天生灵力充沛远胜于人。他们的力量若能善加利用，归于正道，于苍生 又何尝不是一件好事。 ” 魔族人在修习术法的天赋技能上，绝对是碾压完爆人界的。种族不同，能量体系也不同。 人族靠灵气，魔族靠魔气，沈清秋估摸着其实是差不多的东西，就是颜色和叫法不太一 样。也不知道魔界风水好还是怎么回事，大多数的魔族一生下来时就魔气满格，三岁手撕 活人，八岁劈山裂石 …… 咳咳夸张了点。 不过，大实话是，很多资质平庸的人，修个几十年也，就人家魔族一个小婴儿的水准。更 多的人则是像个干涸的池塘，灵力干脆是个零鸡蛋，这种人就是通常说的 “ 没有灵根 ”“ 无 缘仙门 ” 的人，不能更虐。要不是相较喜欢开枝散叶的人类，魔族人丁稀少，人界早就成 魔族的殖民地了，也就欺负人家计划生育抓得严。 折腾了这惊天动地的一通，沈清秋彻夜未眠，两个黑眼圈浮了出来，挥挥手： “ 夜已深了 ，既然没有别的事，就快些下去休息吧。 ” 洛冰河乖乖告了退。可他走出去才没几步，就听沈清秋在身后叫： “ 回来。 ”,"CHAPTER 19: EARNEST INSTRUCTION Luo Binghe said, “When living as a parasite off others’ dream realms, if one often changes hosts, their spirit will weaken and suffer damage during the transfers, but if they live long-term within a set host’s body, they can preserve and nurture it instead, stabilizing their spirit.” He paused, then said, “Senior Meng Mo, could it be that you’re already approaching your limit, and that’s why you have to pick me to be the host you’ll raise?” Having been seen through by him, Meng Mo neither denied it nor became angry, and instead grandly admitted, “That’s right! Who’d have thought, boy, that you were actually so well-learned and knowledgeable, to even know something like this.” Meng Mo saw that his expression was unperturbed, and unable to mull out what this boy was thinking, continued, “However, don’t assume that this elder absolutely must have you as a host. Greatly gifted demons number in the millions; which one wouldn’t kneel and ask for this special honor! Even you should consider carefully, whether you can afford to miss this opportunity.” In actuality, over these years his spirit had steadily degenerated. Originally residing within a demonic artifact, he’d been happily living there; with a hundred and eighty years of meditation he would have been brimming with energy again, but it just had to happen that Sha Hualing, unaware of this and in a series of freak coincidences, used the artifact as a weapon and unloaded it on Luo Binghe, and Meng Mo no longer had the strength to search for another host. But on the road to his doom, he’d unexpectedly discovered that buried within the body and consciousness of the boy he newly resided in, a faintly discernible and incredible power lay concealed, and he became ecstatic; how could he let go of this? He’d already resolved, that no matter how sternly Luo Binghe refused, he’d wheedle and pester, make threats and promises; even if it meant exhausting every single method he’d persuade him to learn demonic techniques from himself, to make his body and consciousness an even more suitable residence. Meng Mo said, “This elder will give you time, so think through it carefully. Otherwise, I’ll trap you and your Shizun’s consciousnesses within the dream realm forever; this elder is capable of that much!” Luo Binghe’s head snapped up, and in an instant, at the cold light thatflashed through the youth’s eyes, Meng Mo froze, intimidated. Luo Binghe’s gentle and humble demeanor from just before was completely gone, his voice ice-cold. “Right now you are discussing terms with me, and are free to say anything. But if you harm Shizun, everything is void!” Meng Mo was frozen for a long time, before finally returning to himself, stunned that he’d actually been terrorized by the power of an insignificant, ordinary Human Realm cultivator’s presence. Of course he did not know, that this sort of presence, in the later generations was called, (the protagonist’s exclusive) aura of awesomeness! The cave suddenly exploded with a burst of loud laughter. “Boy, you really have quite a temper!” After that ancient voice finished saying those words, Luo Binghe immediately felt his limbs become heavy, the scenery around him spinning before he was plunged into darkness. In a flash and with a start, Luo Binghe awoke inside the woodshed, his vest completely drenched. And at the same time, Shen Qingqiu also sprang up on the bed, like a corpse coming alive after death. Head and vision dizzy and spinning, he gasped for breath for a while, and only then did he finally relax. Horrible horrible horrible. Horrible enough to kill! How come! How come in the original work Ning Yingying was also dragged into a dream within a dream by Meng Mo, how come the dream weaved for her was a comforting childhood memory, where her parents let her pick flowers and ride horses, how come on his turn he was first surrounded by fist- sized man-eating wasps, then dashing madly through the narrow passages of a tomb, while tightly pursued by a giant ball of fire! The most terrifying thing was that in the final part of the dream within a dream, Meng Mo had even weaved him what he feared the most! Within the dark and damp dungeon, he was suspended in midair by a ring around his waist, and could not feel his limbs. When he opened his mouth no sound came out, and he could only helplessly hiss. His entire body burned with pain. Only after an unknown length of time had passed within the dream, did the sound of a stone door opening come from outside the dungeon. Footsteps neither fast nor slow steadily approached, then the shadow of a person cast on the floor before him. On the ink-black hem, were embroidered exquisite motifs in silver thread.From that person came an ice-cold pressure, more stifling than the dungeon’s airless darkness. Shen Qingqiu could not clearly see that person’s face. But he knew very well who that person was! Meng Mo truly deserved to be a legendary figure among demons, that dream realm was really far too realistic. Even the damp odor of decay seemed to linger in his nose, nauseating him. Shen Qingqiu managed to keep sitting for a while, then really rolled off the bed, and began to vomit. Ding-dong. Now of all fucking times, a System notification sprang up: Congratulations on completing the scenario, “Meng Mo’s Barrier!” The System awards you +500 satisfaction points! Please continue working hard! Shen Qingqiu made a “stop” gesture, and still had enough in him to try settling debts. “Let’s have a proper discussion. You, when you threatened to deduct satisfaction points, it wasn’t this amount, right? Why not also set it at 500? Are large punishments and small rewards really fair? And I went through an extra scenario of the dream within a dream, why didn’t you calculate extra B- points for me? System? System! System don’t you play dead, let’s sign a new contract!” At this moment, someone slammed open the Bamboo House’s door and rushed inside, like a gust of wind. “Shizun!” He knew who it was from just the sound. Shen Qingqiu miserably rolled his eyes. He really did not want to see this face right now! Luo Binghe had already thrown himself to his side, overflowing with anxiety as he asked, “Shizun, how are you? Do you feel unwell anywhere?” Truthfully, not too terrible… if you could stay a bit further away I’d feel even better… Shen Qingqiu averted his face, and with unyielding strength and poise, stood by himself. “Everything is well with this master.” Originally Luo Binghe had wanted to help him up, yet his hand had been reflexively shoved away; he could not help but freeze. Shen Qingqiu didn’t notice these small shifts of emotion from him, and tidied his clothes, verifying to himself that even with only an inner robe on, his image remained spotless, and asked, “Did that Meng Mo trouble you further afterwards?”Trouble my ass. Meng Mo couldn’t even lick Luo Binghe’s shoes in time. Shen Qingqiu was asking despite knowing. Luo Binghe hesitated for a while, then replied, “That demon elder’s spiritual strength seemed insufficient, and afterwards this disciple was expelled from the dream realm. Shizun, did you encounter anything inside the dream within a dream?” Shen Qingqiu boasted shamelessly, “Even if I did encounter something, could this master not handle it!” Of course he couldn’t handle it! Even now the shadow of being a human stick remained; with Luo Binghe so close to him, his entire body was tingling, and he couldn’t stop averting his gaze while suppressing his fear. Unsure of the reason, Luo Binghe only saw that his expression was odd, gaze no longer calmly looking straight at him like in the past, and was both fretful and anxious within his heart. Luckily Shen Qingqiu adjusted his attitude extremely quickly, remembering that he was a teacher, and what he should do at this time. The next instant, he reached out and grabbed Luo Binghe’s wrist, saying firmly, “Being invaded by a demon is no joke. This master will examine you for a while. We cannot be too lenient.” His wrist in a grasp, Luo Binghe obediently said, “Yes.” His heart had just been able to rest a little, but now it was suspended once more. On the off chance Shen Qingqiu uncovered Meng Mo, and exposed the peculiarity within his body afterwards… But though Shen Qingqiu examined him very diligently for a while, he didn’t detect anything peculiar. Of course he didn’t detect anything, Meng Mo had several-hundred years’ worth of skill and experience, his celebrated reputation wasn’t inflated in the slightest, but Shen Qingqiu had to go through the motions. His examination fruitless, he still repeatedly urged Luo Binghe to visit Qian Cao Peak and Qiong Ding Peak tomorrow and let other people take a look, and to absolutely say something if an issue came up. Yet Luo Binghe had no intention of leaving, and with the appearance of someone full of worries, started and stopped speaking several times before asking, “Shizun, demons… are they all wicked beyond redemption, to be exterminated down to the last?” Upon hearing this question, Shen Qingqiu did not reply right away. He stood in place, indeed finding it hard to answer. Seeing how Luo Binghe had frozen in place, forcibly keeping calm while also somewhat anticipating his answer, Shen Qingqiu slowly said, “Humans canbe good or bad, so naturally demons too can be good or evil. We always see demons victimizing people, but that doesn’t mean cases where humans harm innocent demons never happen. Don’t put too much weight on race.” This was the first time Luo Binghe had heard a teacher express this kind of opinion; he listened in a daze, heart thumping wildly. “Shizun means, even if one is closely connected to demons, it doesn’t mean they’re intolerable to the heavens, is that right?” Shen Qingqiu countered with his own question, “How can you claim they’re intolerable to the heavens? If they’re intolerable, why let them exist? Whether they’re tolerated or not, who has the authority to say?” With this chain of counter questions, Luo Binghe’s eyes gradually lit up; there was a faint sense of burning passion. Finally, Shen Qingqiu said, “Luo Binghe, the words this master tells you henceforth, you may simply ignore after listening. But what I’ve told you here today, you must remember firmly. In this world, there is nothing intolerable to the heavens. This is true for all races, as it’s true for humans.” At this time, though Luo Binghe’s heart faced the righteous path, he was not a small-minded person. In any case, since this could not be removed, why not put it to good use. He absolutely had to become stronger! Stronger until he would never be powerless, stronger until he could protect Shizun from anyone’s hands. Seeing how his eyes were dazzling bright, Shen Qingqiu did not know that within his heart, his thoughts were a jumbled mess. His advice this time, wasn’t purely because he’d developed an addiction to being a sage guiding the protagonist’s life journey. Though this was a universal concept, older than time itself, and had been recycled for many decades by the historical, wuxia, and xianxia genres without the slightest hint of progress, but in this world of ocean-deep hatred between humans and demons, who were unable to coexist and had undergone countless great wars in the past to present, it became extremely unconventional, to the point of risking the world’s condemnation. As someone of mixed heritage, it was extremely difficult for Luo Binghe to not be impacted by these notions; since the greater half of his life had been rough and full of misfortunes, he’d even had despairing thoughts that perhaps the world and heavens found his existence intolerable, that he should have never been born. Shen Qingqiu hoped that from this point forth, these words could sowa seed within his heart, open up his viewpoint. That in the future, when facing the truth, he could remain optimistic, and not take the attacks on his heritage to heart; perhaps then his behaviour would not become so extreme, only thinking of revenge on society. Even if someday in the future he would have to face a Shen Qingqiu who would kick him down into the Endless Abyss, he had to understand, that this was not his fault. If such was possible, when the scenario arrived, and if at that time the System forced him to say lines like, “humans and demons cannot coexist their hatred is ocean-deep and cannot be overcome you fucker hurry up and die,” sending his entire self flying along with his face, there was nothing he could do! Now that the atmosphere had changed, Shen Qingqiu felt he’d gone overboard with his act of coolness, and with his phobia of embarrassment about to erupt, he coughed once. “That said, demons are naturally abundant in spiritual strength, far more than humans. If their strength could be used for good, and belongs to the righteous path, to the common people, then how is that not a good thing.” Demons had excellent talent for cultivation, and absolutely crushed the Human Realm there. As their races were different, their energy systems were also different. Humans relied on spiritual qi, demons relied on demonic qi, Shen Qingqiu reckoned that the two were about the same, with only the color and name being different. Who knew if it was because the Demon Realm had good fengshui or what, but the vast majority of demons were born brimming with demonic qi; at age three they could rip apart a human with their bare hands, at age eight they could split mountains and crack stone… ahem, this was a bit of an exaggeration. However, the truth was, many humans had mediocre aptitude, even after cultivating for several decades, could only achieve the level of a small demon infant. Even more humans were like a dried-out pond, their spiritual strength practically a perfect egg of a zero; these humans were often said to be “lacking spiritual roots” or “lacking any lot for immortality;” it couldn’t get worse than that. If it weren’t for the humans’ comparative love of propagating, with demon numbers being scarce, the Human Realm would have long been colonized by demons, so they were just taking advantage of how strict demon family planning was. After being tormented on this world-shaking journey, Shen Qingqiu had not slept the entire night, and two dark bags had already appeared; he waved hishand. “It’s very late at night; if there is nothing else, then quickly go and rest.” Luo Binghe obediently asked to be excused. But he hadn’t walked out far, when he heard Shen Qingqiu call from behind, “Come back.”"
他立刻折返： “ 师尊还有什么吩咐？ ” 沈清秋： “ 房间在那边，你走反方向做什么？ ” 无论是弟子们休息的竹舍还是柴房，都是出门左拐，洛冰河却直接往右拐了。 洛冰河道： “ 弟子想去厨房，先把师尊明日的早饭备好。 ” 沈清秋为难起来。 他是真想吃洛冰河做的早饭，可大半夜的让一孩子不睡觉给自己做饭，听起来岂不像灰姑 娘和他后母 …… 怎么听怎么不人道。 最终，良知战胜了口腹之欲。他咳了一下： “ 胡闹。三更半夜的做什么饭。回去睡觉。 ” 洛冰河知道他担心自己休息不好，笑着应了，却准备待会儿再偷偷到厨房去琢磨。 沈清秋本想问他，是不是还睡在柴房，可想想，少年人总是有点自尊的，直接问出来，面 上多不好看。况且，就算让洛冰河去睡弟子们的房间，旁人也只会在明帆的授意下排挤他 ，抢他被子藏他鞋子什么的，感觉怪可怜的。 沈清秋： “ 你明天收拾一下东西，到我这边来。 ” 洛冰河一时没明白他的意思： “ 师尊？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 竹舍外面还有一间偏室，从明日起你就搬到里面来住吧。 ” 住近一点的话，今后想给他做早饭、打扫房间什么的也更方便嘛 …… 沈清秋心态调整能力 一向破天际，刚才还连洛冰河的脸都无法直视，现在又敢暗搓搓谋划着让主角大大给他 端茶送水洗衣叠被。正胡思乱想，没注意到对方的反应。突然，洛冰河一个虎扑，结结实 实地抱住了他。 沈清秋猝不及防，先是吓了一跳。然后，老脸一红。 有生之年终于被人熊抱一次结果不是温香软玉的妹子是个从头到脚王霸之气的少年啊啊啊  洛冰河似是开心极了，搂着他的脖子不肯撒手，一直在他耳边叫： “ 师尊！师尊！ ” 沈清秋那手不知道该往哪里放，纠结好一会儿，还是放到了洛冰河头上，摸了摸顺了顺毛 ：“ 好了。叫也叫了，抱也抱了，吵吵嚷嚷的，也不害臊，这么大人了，又不是十岁小孩 ，像什么样子？ ” 本来洛冰河还没怎么在意，被他这么一说，忽然不好意思起来。要不是一时欢喜之情激荡 ，他哪里敢这么对平时高高在上的师尊啊。连忙恋恋不舍把自己从沈清秋身上扒下来，满 脸通红： “ 是、我、弟子逾越了。 ” 求抱抱这种事，十岁以下的小孩子来做是萌萌哒，十五岁的洛冰河来做 …… 还是萌萌哒！ 长了一张青葱粉嫩的小帅哥胚子脸无论做什么都是萌萌哒！ 洛冰河手足无措了一会儿，原本有些心慌意乱，可猛然注意到，沈清秋脸色不太好。 即便是仙功护体，可有旧伤和中毒在先，紧接着又因为他而被卷入梦魔的梦境，没休息好 ，仍是扛不住，模样自然是有几分憔悴。洛冰河不敢再耽误沈清秋休息，依依告退。还是 没回柴房，这次特地绕了一通才到厨房。 他下定决心：接下来很长一段时间都必须重视师尊的饮食调养了！ 洛冰河前脚刚踏出房门，后脚系统提示就来了。 【主角爽度 +50 ！】 沈清秋莫名其妙。 怎么又加了 50 ？系统延迟？还是系统良心发现，觉得之前给我加的太少了？ 算了，困劲上涌，有分加还理他作甚。反正，总不可能是因为抱了一下劳资才加的就是了 ，哈哈哈哈哈哈 …… 第二天，沈清秋还没一觉睡到自然醒，就被阵阵鱼米清香馋醒了。竹舍外洛冰河早已精心 备好餐点，那香味飘得无数吃惯寡淡饭食的清静峰弟子们都躲在一旁窥探。 明帆等人气得恨不得边窥探边咬袍子的角，尤其是看到沈清秋坐到了桌边，慈爱地对洛冰 河的手艺和心意大加褒扬，两人相对而笑一派其乐融融，哀怨值达到了最高点。 太不要脸了！居然使这种奇和谐淫巧计旁门左道来讨师尊欢心！ 而等到傍晚时分，洛冰河搬到沈清秋的竹舍偏室时，一道晴天霹雳，把清静峰原先欺负过 洛冰河的弟子们劈了个尸横遍野。 说是 “ 搬 ” ，其实洛冰河只是一条人过去了。因为他本来就没什么东西留在柴房。 枕头？柴房里的稻草捆一捆就能枕。被子？脱下外衣就能盖了 …… 而这些东西过去之后沈 清秋自然给他准备好了。 沈清秋一直觉得洛冰河这生活未免太过苦情了，整个一虐童实录。苍穹山好歹也是一个修 真大派，总不至于人心阴暗到这种地步，物资缺乏到这种地步。 当晚，洛冰河人生中第一次，躺到了正常的床上。 以往，他躺过在冰川上漂流的木盆，睡过阴冷潮湿的地面，喧闹的街边，风餐露宿时还躺 过山洞，都习以为常。现在睡在一张柔软又整洁的竹床上，反而浑身轻飘飘的没有实感。 尤其是想到沈清秋就睡在离他只有一墙之隔的主室。 这一夜，也许是思虑过多，梦魔并没有出现在他的梦境中。 洛冰河不动声色，坐以静待。过了几日，果然等到了梦魔的再次出现。 这次梦魔就没搞什么神神秘秘的结界，压根没打算藏匿，而是直接出现在了洛冰河的梦中 …… 虽然是以一团黑雾的形式。 这团黑雾在洛冰河眼前时聚时散，变幻不息，那个苍老的声音就是从中发出的： “ 小子， 这三天考虑的如何？ ” 洛冰河反问道： “ 我考虑的如何，梦魔前辈会不知道吗？ ” 梦魔嘿嘿笑道： “ 你选择了一条你绝对不会后悔的路。小子，好好记住这一天，今日就是 你飞黄腾达的开始！ ” 哪个少年人没有飞黄腾达的梦，他说的豪气万千，洛冰河却不为所动，只抱拳一礼，道： “ 晚辈还有一事相求。 ” “ 还有什么事，都是一并说了！快快说完就可以拜师了。 ” 梦魔还在那里催促，却不知道他 想得太美了 …… 洛冰河道： “ 晚辈要说的，正是此事。师尊待我恩重如山，我实在不能不经他的允许，就 擅自摆旁人为师 ……” 还没说完，梦魔立刻忍无可忍道： “ 行行行！老夫不要这个师徒的名分，行了吧？！ ” 还有比他更亏的奇人高人吗？上赶着教人家本族术法，还连人家一声师父都听不到。 和进了门含亲茹苦倾情奉献还得不到名分的小妾有什么区别！ 洛冰河微笑道： “ 那就多谢前辈了。 ” 他一点也不愿意叫沈清秋以外的任何人 “ 师尊 ” 。 梦魔看到他这个样子，若他肉身还在，恐怕鼻子都气歪了。 这洛冰河在他师尊面前那叫一个乖巧听话，跟朵小白花儿似的，怎么到了别人面前，就这 么难对付！完完全全是两个样子，换了个人！ 真是气死老夫也！ 光阴似箭，日月如梭。 …… 沈清秋真的不想用这么烂大街的俗语，但除此以外，他真的找不到更适合的短语。 他每天在清静峰上，弹弹琴，看看书，写写字，画画画，练练功，偶尔挑剔一下洛冰河做 的饭菜不好吃，偶尔串门跟柳清歌斗斗嘴过过招，时不时到岳清源那里汇报一下工作，日 子过得飞快，完美地达成他 “ 混吃等死，颐养天年 ” 的生活目标。 直到仙盟大会终于来到。 这一天终于还是来了。日子过得太悠哉，沈清秋都要把全书第一个大 □□ 给忘了。 挂逼洛冰河登上人生高峰、迎娶白富美、也是从此再也洗不白的第一步 …… 他居然能给忘 了！ 因此，收到烫金的邀请帖时，沈清秋怔了好一会儿。 仙盟大会，是《狂傲仙魔途》的第一个大 □□ 。同时，也是本书的一个转折点。 仙盟大会四年一度，是甄选新秀、扬名立万的绝佳机会。每年形式都因各大掌门的讨论而 有所不同，但一定会有一张金榜。 无论出身名门、抑或落拓江湖，只要你在大会中表现出色，就能金榜题名，扬名天下。 此前，《狂傲仙魔途》的成绩一直不温不火，而仙盟大会一出，书评留言订阅打赏，通通 立刻飞涨！ 其原因，不仅在于从这里开始，向天打飞机菊苣舍弃了他原本就所剩无几的节操，铁打的 男主流水的妹子哗哗地往上送，大段香艳描写和各种令人脸红心跳的擦边球层出不穷，还 有一个重要原因，也是当初吸引沈清秋一路追下去的主要原因。 那就是魔物系统！ 向天打飞机菊苣作为一个连修真设定都没查完全、经常连角色是筑基或者元婴都搞不清楚 的作者，却很少被人吐槽这一点，就是因为他的小说，卖的不是这一点。 《狂傲仙魔途》此书与其叫做 “ 修真 ” 小说，倒不如直接叫做 “ 打怪 ” 小说。 “ 打 ” 的成分，完 全碾压 “ 修 ” 的成分。作为修真文而言，它是一篇不折不扣的雷文，但作为一本怪物图鉴， 倒还挺有意思的。 也就是说，很快，沈清秋就要直面书中描写的那些形状各异、凶残至极的妖魔鬼怪了。 更重要的是，很快，就到了他亲手把魔族后裔身份暴露的洛冰河，残忍地一掌打下无间深 渊的时刻了。 命运的齿轮已经开始缓缓转动 ……,"CHAPTER 20: ARDUOUS TASK He immediately turned back. “Does Shizun have any other instructions?” Shen Qingqiu: “The dorms are that way; why are you walking in the other direction?” The disciples’ bamboo houses and the woodshed were both a left turn out the door, yet Luo Binghe had turned to the right. Luo Binghe said, “This disciple wants to go to the kitchen, and first prepare tomorrow’s breakfast for Shizun.” Shen Qingqiu was in a bind. He really wanted to eat Luo Binghe’s breakfast, but to have a child cook for him instead of sleeping so late at night, doesn’t it sound like Cinderella and her stepmother… either way, it sounds inhumane. In the end, his conscience won over his stomach. He coughed. “Nonsense. It’s the middle of the night, what is there to cook. Go back and sleep.” Luo Binghe knew he was worried about him not resting enough and agreed with a smile, but he still planned to sneak off to the kitchen to work later. Shen Qingqiu wanted to ask him if he was still sleeping in the woodshed, but after thinking it over for a moment, youths still had their dignity; asking outright would be embarrassing. Moreover, even if he let Luo Binghe sleep in the disciples’ dorms, the others would still take Ming Fan’s lead and bully him, steal his blankets and hide his shoes or whatnot, the poor thing. Shen Qingqiu: “Tomorrow, pack up your things and come here.” At first, Luo Binghe did not understand what he meant. “Shizun?” Shen Qingqiu said, “There is a side room outside the bamboo house. Starting tomorrow, you can move there.” If he lived a little closer, in the future, making breakfast and cleaning up around the house would be easier… Shen Qingqiu’s adaptability was as always, as great as a record-breaking dick 88 . Just a moment ago, he couldn’t even look Luo Binghe in the face, but now he even dared to scheme about making the great protagonist wait on him hand and foot: serve his tea, carry his water, wash his clothes, and fold his blankets. Being in the middle of fantasizing, he had not noticed the other’s reaction. Suddenly, Luo Binghe pounced on him like a tiger, grabbing him in a tight embrace. Caught off-guard, Shen Qingqiu first jumped in surprise. Then, his face reddened.In his lifetime someone had finally gave him a bear hug, and it wasn’t a warm and gentle jade-skinned girl, but a youth brimming with awesomeness ahhh Overflowing with happiness, Luo Binghe hugged him around the neck and refused to let go, calling in his ear over and over, “Shizun! Shizun!” Shen Qingqiu didn’t know where to put his hands; after floundering for a while, he placed them on Luo Binghe’s head and stroked his hair. “Alright. You’ve called me and hugged me, made such a racket and you aren’t even embarrassed. You’re already this big, it’s not like you’re a ten-year-old child; how does this look to you?” Originally, Luo Binghe hadn’t thought about it so much; having it put that way, he suddenly grew ashamed. If he had not been overwhelmed by a surge of joy, he would never dare treat his normally aloof and remote Shizun like this. Though reluctant, he hurried to peel himself from Shen Qingqiu’s body, his whole face red. “Yes, I, this disciple has overstepped.” When it came to asking for hugs, on children under the age of ten it was moe 89 , but on the fifteen-year-old Luo Binghe… it was still moe! With a handsome little sprout’s fresh and tender face, anything you do would be moe! Luo Binghe floundered for a while, at first a little flustered, but then he suddenly noticed that Shen Qingqiu’s complexion didn’t look very good. Even though he had the immortal body of a cultivator, there were old injuries and poison, and then because of Luo Binghe, had been dragged into Meng Mo’s dream realm; he hadn’t rested properly and was at his limit, so of course he looked a bit haggard. Luo Binghe didn’t dare interfere with Shen Qingqiu’s rest any longer, and reluctantly said his goodbyes. Still, he didn’t return to the woodshed, and this time made sure to take a detour before going to the kitchen. He promised himself: for the next long while, he must carefully watch over Shizun’s diet and recuperation! As soon as Luo Binghe stepped out of the room, a System notification arrived. Protagonist satisfaction points +50! Shen Qingqiu was mystified. Why add another 50? System lag? Or did the System discover its conscience, and felt it gave me too little before? Whatever, he was exhausted, so what if points were added. Anyway, therewas no way his capital had been increased because of a single hug, hahahahahaha… The next day, Shen Qingqiu hadn’t slept his fill, before the fragrant, wafting scent of fish and rice tempted him awake. Outside the bamboo house, Luo Binghe had long prepared a meal with utmost care; the scent drew in countless Qing Jing Peak disciples used to eating bland food; they hid off to the side, snooping. Enraged, Ming Fan and the others chewed their sleeve hems while watching; especially when they saw Shen Qingqiu sit at the table, affectionately singing praises about Luo Binghe’s handiwork and efforts. With the two smiling at each other joyously, their grief and resentment reached its peak. Too shameless! Using these wicked (harmonious) schemes and unorthodox methods to curry Shizun’s favor! And then that evening, when Luo Binghe moved his things into the side room of Shen Qingqiu’s house, like lightning from clear skies, it wiped out all the Qing Jing Peak disciples who used to bully Luo Binghe, leaving their corpses scattered all over the field. Though the words were ‘moved his things,’ in truth it was only Luo Binghe himself. Because from the beginning, he really didn’t have anything in the woodshed. A pillow? A bundle of the straw from the woodshed was enough to rest his head. Blankets? His outer robes were enough to cover him… and of course Shen Qingqiu would have prepared these things for him already. Shen Qingqiu had always thought that Luo Binghe’s life really was too miserable, really a textbook case of child abuse. Cang Qiong Mountain Sect was one of the major sects of the cultivation world, how could people’s hearts be this dark; how could their resources be so lacking. That night, Luo Binghe laid on a normal bed for the first time in his life. Before, he had laid in a wooden basin floating on the icy river, had slept on the damp and cold ground, noisy streets, and had even laid in mountain caves while roughing it out in the wild, it had become normal. On the contrary, now that he was sleeping on soft and tidy bamboo bed, his entire body felt light and floaty, like none of this was real. Especially when he thought of Shen Qingqiu sleeping in the main room just a wall away from him. This night, perhaps because he had too much on his mind, Meng Mo did not appear in his dream realm.Luo Binghe kept his composure and waited. Sure enough, a few days later, Meng Mo appeared once more. This time, Meng Mo did not set up some mysterious barrier, having no intentions to hide from the beginning; instead he appeared directly in Luo Binghe’s dream… though he did so in the form of a cloud of black mist. This cloud of black mist expanded and contracted before Luo Binghe’s eyes, endlessly transforming, and that aged voice sounded out from its midst. “Boy, what have you decided in these three days?” Luo Binghe replied with a question. “Would senior Meng Mo not know what I have decided?” Meng Mo chuckled. “You have chosen a path you will definitely not regret. Boy, remember this day, today is the beginning of your meteoric rise!” What youth didn’t have dreams of meteoric success; his words were full of grand heroic spirit, but Luo Binghe was not moved; he only cupped his fist and bowed, then said, “This junior has one more request.” “What is it, get it all out! Hurry up and finish so you can finally become my apprentice.” Meng Mo urged him on, not knowing that he was being far too optimistic… Luo Binghe said, “What this junior wanted to speak about is precisely this. My Shizun treats me with utmost kindness; I really cannot apprentice under another without his permission…” Before he could finish, Meng Mo said, at the end of his patience, “Fine, fine, fine! This elder won’t demand the titles of master and apprentice, is that enough?” Was there any extraordinary master getting a worse deal than him? Falling over himself to teach someone his people’s techniques, yet he won’t even get to hear that person call him Shifu. What difference was there between him and a bitterly suffering and absolutely devoted concubine, who still couldn’t gain any status? Luo Binghe smiled. “Then, many thanks to Senior.” He was not at all willing to call anyone other than Shen Qingqiu “Shizun”. Watching him, if Meng Mo had still had a physical body, his nose would have gone crooked in rage. This Luo Binghe, all cute and obedient in front of his Shizun, just like a little white lotus. So then, why was he so hard to deal with when before other people! Two completely different faces, practically a different person! This elder is going to die of rage!Time flew like an arrow, the sun and moon like a weaver’s shuttle. Shen Qingqiu really didn’t want to use this worn-out saying, but other than that, he really couldn’t find a better phrasing. Every day on Qing Jing Peak, he would play guqin, read books, write calligraphy, paint paintings, practice his cultivation, occasionally nitpick Luo Binghe’s food, occasionally bicker or spar with Liu Qingge, and report on his work to Yue Qingyuan from time to time. The days flew by, perfectly accomplishing his life goal of “idling his life away, enjoying his years”. Until the Immortal Alliance Conference finally arrived. In the end, this day really did arrive. His days had been too carefree; Shen Qingqiu had about forgotten the first major climax of the novel. The first step of Luo Binghe cheating his way to the top, of marrying all the dream women 90 , as well as the first step to his blackening, never again to be washed clean… and he had actually managed to forget it! So, when he received the gilded invitation, Shen Qingqiu stared at it in shock for a long time. The Immortal Alliance Conference was Proud Immortal Demon Way’s first major climax. At the same time, it was also an important turning point of the novel. The Immortal Alliance Conference was held once every four years, and was an excellent opportunity to pick out new talent and establish one’s reputation. Each time, due to the major sect leaders’ discussions, the exact structure of the proceedings, but there would definitely be a top ranker’s list. No matter if you came from a prestigious sect, or from the poorest parts of the jianghu, as long as your performance in the conference was outstanding, your name would be listed on the gold-inscribed tablet, and you’d gain fame across the land. Before this, Proud Immortal Demon Way’s performance was always lukewarm, but once the Immortal Alliance Conference arc came out, the reviews, comments, subscriptions, and tips all soared into the heavens! It wasn’t only because from that point forward, “Great Master” Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky abandoned all his already-minimal moral principles, and poured forth women one after the next 91 , with large sections of titillating descriptions and blush-inducing, barely-legal passages emerging one after another; there was another important reason, and it was this main reason that had first drawn Shen Qingqiu to follow the novel until the end. That was the demonic beasts!The reason “Great Master” Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky, as an author who hadn’t even properly researched cultivation settings, and was often confused whether characters were at the Foundation Establishment or Nascent Soul stages, rarely received tsukkomi on this point, was because this was not the selling point of his novel. Rather than being called a “cultivation” novel, Proud Immortal Demon Way might as well just be called a “monster-fighting” novel. The “fighting” component well outweighed the “cultivation” component. As a cultivation novel, it was out-and-out filled with landmines, but as a monster handbook, it was pretty entertaining. That is to say, very soon, Sheng Qingqiu would directly face those savage monsters of all shapes and sizes, as described in the book. And more importantly, very soon, it would be time for him to personally and mercilessly strike Luo Binghe, with his demonic heritage revealed, into the Endless Abyss. The gears of fate (the plot) have already started to turn…"
沈清秋沉默良久，才把帖子搁扔明帆怀里，让他下去收好。 洛冰河得了梦魔每日在梦境中指导，进步神速。早就可以独当一面，沈清秋乐的经常把苍 穹山派内部一些琐碎事务打发给他去处理。再长大一点，下山除魔、助人为乐的任务也都 扔给了他。免得他每天在自己身边晃来晃去。 虽然被伺候得舒舒服服，但这孩子不知道是长偏了还是怎么的，黏他黏的有点太厉害了 …… 沈清秋时常也会反省一下，是不是因为自己也对他宠的有些过分，应该适当抹黑一下 自己，向系统证明他坚定的反派立场。不然再这样下去，他怕到时候没办法狠下心把洛冰 河一掌打下无间深渊。 然而，说是这么说，每次反省完后，下次遇上洛冰河，面对那张人畜无害的脸、任劳任怨 的身影，沈清秋总是习惯性地先夸一夸： “ 卷宗抄完了 / 人救出来了 / 东西找到了 / 菜做好 了？嗯，干得不错。 ” 夸完就忘了他原本打算干啥 …… 明帆收了帖子，窥他脸色不是很好，想到洛冰河那臭小子下山后，师尊对厨房的伙食百般 挑剔，这些天都没怎么好好吃饭，问道： “ 师尊，要让弟子准备些粥点吗？ ” 沈清秋真没胃口，摆手： “ 不必。你下去吧。 ” 明帆不敢多说，老老实实下去了。他泪洒心田：洛冰河这小子这几年已经完全成了师尊的 心头肉，我居然都没办法让师尊喝口粥！ 当然他没考虑到可能是厨艺的问题。 不知过了多久，又有脚步声靠近。 沈清秋道： “ 不是说了不用吗？ ” “ 弟子千里迢迢从外洲奔波回来，师尊连看都不看一眼，就要拒绝么？ ” 这声音温雅清，还带点玩笑的委屈，沈清秋一听，差点连人带椅翻倒在地。他猛一回 头。十七岁的少年身长玉立，身着白衫，唇角勾起一点笑意，正双目灼灼瞧着他。 洛冰河背负的长剑，是从万剑峰拔出的 “ 正阳 ” 。仙剑的名字和此时洛冰河的气质相得益 彰。剑身灵光熠熠，这虽然也是把极上等的好剑，被洛冰河从岩壁中拔出时，引来了一众 同门的惊呼赞叹，可是比起真正属于洛冰河的那把剑，却不是一个档次的。 沈清秋定了定神： “ 这次怎么这么快就回来了？ ” 洛冰河在他旁边的座位上坐下，稳稳地斟了一盏茶，推到沈清秋手边： “ 不是什么棘手的 祸患，又想念师尊想念的紧，就马不停蹄地回来了。 ” 这话听起来很有几分油嘴滑舌，不过洛冰河身为男主角，总有一种再油嘴滑舌的话都能说 得诚挚温润无比的功力。对此，沈清秋 …… 很受用！ 沈清秋拿起那盏茶，喝了一口。从穹顶峰搜刮来的雪山香茗，却没喝出味道来。他道： “ 仙盟大会要开始了。 ” 洛冰河早就知道此事，问道： “ 可要弟子将清静峰的参会弟子名单先拟一份，交由师尊过 目？ ” 这些年，这些杂事，或大或小，沈清秋都统统扔给洛冰河去处理。反正洛冰河现在这么乖 巧听话好用，做事又周到缜密，沈清秋实在想不到有什么理由为什么非要自己做 …… 最终 决策之前，洛冰河总是会自觉请沈清秋过目一遍，看看有什么不稳妥的。沈清秋总是想说 ，其实你不必再给我检查一遍啊，真的，你办事能力比我强多了！ 沈清秋道： “ 拟好之后直接上报给掌门师兄就好了。 ” 洛冰河点了点头，还想说点什么，却微觉异样。 今日的沈清秋，似乎格外留意自己。他忍不住笑道： “ 师尊为何一直看我？莫非是弟子下 山这么多天，师尊也思念徒儿了？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 我养的，还不许我看了？ ” 洛冰河嘻嘻地道： “ 自然许的。师尊看得可顺眼？ ” 沈清秋摇头笑笑，斟酌着措辞，道： “ 冰河。 ” 洛冰河也觉察到，沈清秋似乎有重要的话要讲，瞬间正色： “ 是？ ” 沈清秋盯着他的双眼： “ 你想不想变强？强到无与伦比、天下莫敢争锋的地步？ ” 这个问题，很早之前，洛冰河就有了答案。 他正襟危坐，毫不犹豫，直视回去： “ 是！ ” 见他回答得如此决绝，沈清秋心内送了一口气。又追问道： “ 假如在那之前，你要遭受许 多痛苦折磨，经历无数磨难，身心都逼近崩溃，你也要做至高强者？ ” 洛冰河缓缓道： “ 苦楚磨难，冰河皆无所畏惧，但求能强到足以守护重要的人和事！ ” 沈清秋得到了这个答案，心里总算略略平衡了一些。 是的。洛冰河啊，为了守护你今后左拥右抱如花似玉的三千后宫佳丽，你必须变强才行！ 虽然心下仍是不忍，可想到这是身为主角必须经历的破茧成蝶的过程，沈清秋也不得不调 整心态。 虽然给自己洗脑他已经很娴熟，可仍然不会因为次数多就有半点感到愉快。 三日后，苍穹山十二峰各峰弟子参会名单备齐，齐赴大会。 此次仙盟大会的召开场所是一处地势复杂、起伏延绵数里的山脉，名为绝地谷。 成名的人物自持身份，不会再去参加仙盟大会，和小辈们争风头。没必要，也不屑于。因 此，十二位峰主和师叔师伯级的人物都不会报名。名额上限高，那自然多多益善，最后装 备齐整，向绝地谷出发的，浩浩荡荡居然有一百来号人。 这么多人飞天御剑太过高调扰民，所以他们还是车行。 一本修真小说，居然一天到晚都骑马坐车！沈清秋永远无法理解向天打飞机做这种设定的 意义，但是再值得吐的槽吐个三年也会吐干，对此他已经麻木了。 大多数人都选择骑马，英姿飒爽。不过一来沈清秋不擅长骑术，不想摔断脖子，二来嫌在 外面风吹日山雨淋的不够闲适，不够优雅，于是在众目睽睽下钻进了马车。 马车里早已有了先来先到者，一看他折扇挑起帘子往里钻就鄙夷道： “ 一个大男人，也跟 我抢地方！ ” 此女眉目美艳，云髻共胸脯高耸，正是仙姝峰主人齐清萋。 原作的齐清萋和沈清秋没什么交情，也不怎么打交道。不过这几年，沈清秋偶尔与她共事 ，知她心直口快泼辣，还相处的倒还不错。 沈清秋一边用折扇赶她腾出位置，一边泰然自若道： “ 我是病患， ” 齐清萋给他让出位置，嘴上却还不饶： “ 娇生惯养！你这个娇娇宝宝的劲儿，哪里像个金 丹仙修！是不是待会儿还得有人伺候你吃点心？ ” 沈清秋恍然： “ 不错。多谢师妹提醒。 ” 说着扇柄敲了敲马车臂。 不一会儿，车连子被人撩起，洛冰河笑着问： “ 师尊，点心，水，还是腰酸？ ” 白马精神抖数，少年俊朗非凡，阳光照耀之下，令人眼前璨璨一亮。 沈清秋道： “ 你齐师叔想吃点心。 ” 洛冰河立刻从怀里取出包得精巧玲珑的点心奉上。看来是早有准备。 他道： “ 师尊还有吩咐请叫我。 ” 这才放下帘子。 柳清歌策马而过，铿锵有力地哼了一声。 沈清秋道： “ 那是自然。 ” 低头打开纸包， “ 龙须酥。不错嘛。 ” 转而把点心递给齐清萋： “ 吃么？ ” …… 齐清萋难以形容此时的感觉。 她觉得，这大抵是忿忿不平罢了。这么贴心又灵力高强的好徒弟，居然是沈清秋教出来 的。 其实不然。她只是不知道，有个可以形容这种感受的词，叫做 “ 闪瞎狗眼 ” 。 齐清萋不看吃起龙须酥的沈清秋，还在垂死挣扎， “ 连溟烟都骑马！ ” 只要能让沈清秋稍微有一点羞愧感，就是胜利！ 恰好沈清秋无所事事，往外一看，果然，柳溟烟脸罩面纱，背负宝剑 “ 水色 ” ，端坐马上， 微风吹过，纱衣浮动，一副飘飘欲仙之态。 这画面太赏心悦目。沈清秋不由得多看了一会儿，叹道： “ 美不胜收。 ” 齐清萋呸他一脸： “ 休要觊觎我爱徒！ ” 这一来一往两句，被附近的洛冰河收入耳底，他脸色登时一青。 可沈清秋一点没注意他的脸色，干脆边吃点心边往这边看起来了。他就是一种电影开场前 吃爆米花喝可乐等待广告结束正片开始的心态：那可是柳溟烟！男主女主在一个场合，擦 不出火花撞不出 JQ 来，怎么可能！ 洛冰河见师尊一直盯着柳溟烟不放，握住缰绳的手情不自禁越收越紧，骨节发白。 “ 美不胜收 ” ？ 分明脸都没露。再美能有我好看吗？ 洛冰河真不是自恋，他只是一向很清楚自己相貌究竟如何。对此并不沾沾自喜，却也不会 假意矫情地谦虚贬低。 半天也没见沈清秋有收回目光的意思，洛冰河实在忍不住了。他略略催鞭，白马快步上前 ，和柳溟烟并辔而行。 洛冰河侧首微笑，招呼道： “ 柳师妹。 ” 柳溟烟一愣，浅浅颔首，回礼道： “ 洛师兄。 ” 哦哦哦，哦哦哦！开始了开始了！ 此生真的有亲眼看到书中绝色的俊男美女并辔骑行画面的一天，沈清秋暗暗一阵激动，无 法自持地把头更探出了些。 洛冰河余光一扫，见沈清秋不但没移开目光，反而更热火朝天地盯着这边，黑线了一下， 心塞塞到牙痒痒，一边和柳溟烟言笑晏晏，一边不追痕迹地带着两人的马匹越走越快，终 于远到沈清秋不把上半身全部探出马车就看不到的地步。 沈清秋只得扫兴地坐了回去。 怎么给忘了，男女主卿卿我我的时候从来不会有电灯泡和碍事的围观群众的。不过真是孩 子长大了，谈个恋爱也知道要防着躲着长辈了 …… 莫非是叛逆期终于要来了？,"CHAPTER 21: IMMORTAL ALLIANCE CONFERENCE PART 1 Shen Qingqiu was silent for a long time, before he finally tossed the invitation into Ming Fan’s arms, for him to put away. Luo Binghe was receiving Meng Mo’s guidance within the dream realm everyday, and progressing at lightning speed. He had long assumed responsibility of many things; Shen Qingqiu often happily assigned some of Cang Qiong Mountain’s trivial internal tasks for him to handle. Once he became older, missions with demon elimination or helping others outside the mountain were also tossed to him. So that he wouldn’t spend each day wandering around Shen Qingqiu. Though he was being comfortably waited upon, he wasn’t sure if this child’s growth had gone awry or what, sticking to him a little too strongly… Shen Qingqiu often also self-reflected: was it because he’d doted on him too much; should he appropriately smear himself a little, and prove to the System that he was firmly a villain. Otherwise if this kept going, he was afraid that when the time came, he would be unable to harden his heart and strike Luo Binghe into the Endless Abyss. However, though he told himself this, every time he finished reflecting, the next time he met Luo Binghe and saw that pure and innocent face, that hard- working figure, Shen Qingqiu would always first praise out of habit, “You finished copying the files/rescued the people/found the things/are done cooking? Nn, well done.” After praising he’d forget his original plans… Ming Fan put the invitation away and saw that his complexion wasn’t very good; he thought of how after that stinking brat Luo Binghe went down the mountain, Shizun had endlessly picked at the kitchen’s fare, and not eaten properly at all these days; he asked, “Shizun, would you like this disciple to prepare some congee?” Shen Qingqiu really had no appetite, and waved him away. “No need. You can go.” Ming Fan didn’t dare say more, and obediently took his leave. His heart flooded with tears: In the last couple of years that brat Luo Binghe has completely become Shizun’s favorite; I can’t even give Shizun a single mouthful of congee!Of course he didn’t consider that perhaps it was an issue with cooking skill. After an unknown length of time, more footsteps approached. Shen Qingqiu said, “Didn’t I say there was no need?” “This disciple rushed back a long distance from the outer provinces, and Shizun won’t take even a single look at me before refusing?” This voice was gentle and clear, and even carried a hint of teasing dismay; upon hearing it, Shen Qingqiu almost fell to the ground along with his chair. He jerked his head back. A seventeen-year-old youth, slim and tall and graceful, dressed in white robes, lips turned upwards in the hint of a smile, was gazing at him with a pair of shining eyes. The longsword on Luo Binghe’s back was “Zheng Yang 92 ,” drawn from Wan Jian Peak. Its name complemented the current Luo Binghe’s temperament well. The blade of the sword glistened with a sacred light; it was also a good, high-quality sword: when Luo Binghe had pulled it free from the rock wall, it’d elicited numerous surprised exclamations and praise from Sect members, but compared to Luo Binghe’s true personal sword, it wasn’t at the same level. Shen Qingqiu composed himself. “Why have you returned so quickly, this time?” Luo Binghe sat in a seat next to him, and steadily poured a cup of tea, then pushed it towards Shen Qingqiu’s hand. “It wasn’t a difficult-to-handle disaster, and I also missed Shizun terribly, so I rushed back without stopping to rest.” These words sounded rather slick and insincere, but since Luo Binghe was the male lead, he always had the ability to make the smoothest of smooth-talking sound matchlessly warm and sincere. On Shen Qingqiu, this was… very effective! Shen Qingqiu picked up that cup of tea, and took a sip. It was fragrant snowy mountain tea plundered from Qiong Ding Peak, but he couldn’t taste it at all. He said, “The Immortal Alliance Conference is about to begin.” Luo Binghe had long known about this, and asked, “Do you want this disciple to first draft a list of Qing Jing Peak’s participating disciples, and give it to Shizun to check?” These years, these miscellaneous things, whether big or small, Shen Qingqiu had all tossed to Luo Binghe to deal with. After all, right now Luo Binghe was so sweet, obedient, and easy to use, his work thorough and meticulous; Shen Qingqiu absolutely couldn’t think of any reason why he should do them himself… before making the final decision, Luo Binghe would alwaysconscientiously ask Shen Qingqiu to look it over, to see if there was anything unsound. And Shen Qingqiu always wanted to say, actually you needn’t get me to check, seriously; you are much better at handling affairs than me! Shen Qingqiu said, “When the drafting is finished, just report directly to Zhangmen-shixiong.” Luo Binghe nodded; he still wanted to say something, but he sensed something slightly off. Today’s Shen Qingqiu, seemed to be paying extra attention to him. He couldn’t help but smile and ask, “Why does Shizun keep looking at me? Could it be that this disciple has been gone for so long, and Shizun also missed this disciple?” Shen Qingqiu said, “I raised you, yet I’m not allowed to look?” Luo Binghe chortled and said, “Of course Shizun is allowed. Am I pleasing to look at?” Shen Qingqiu shook his head while smiling, considering his next words, then said, “Binghe.” Luo Binghe had also realized, Shen Qingqiu seemed to have important words to say, and his expression instantly turned serious. “Yes?” Shen Qingqiu stared at his eyes. “Do you want to become stronger? Stronger until you are without rival, until no one beneath the heavens would dare compete with you?” Since a long time ago, Luo Binghe had already possessed an answer to this question. Sitting squarely, without the slightest hesitation, he looked straight back. “Yes!” Seeing him answer so resolutely, Shen Qingqiu released a breath of relief within his heart. He followed up and asked, “Even if before getting there, you have to suffer through much pain and torment, experience countless tribulations, to the point your body and heart are about are about to collapse; you would still want to become the strongest of all? Luo Binghe slowly said, “Binghe does not fear suffering and tribulations, and only wishes to be strong enough to protect the people and things important to me!” After receiving this answer, Shen Qingqiu’s thoughts finally settled down a little. That’s right. Luo Binghe, for the sake of protecting your future harem’s myriad 93 of jade-like and flower-like beauties, you must become strong!His heart was still unwilling, but when he thought that this was something the protagonist had to go through, to break free of his chrysalis and become a butterfly, Shen Qingqiu also had no choice but to adjust his mindset. Although he was already adept at brainwashing himself, it wasn’t like he’d feel the slightest bit of happiness just because he’d done it so many times. Three days later, each of Cang Qiong Mountain’s Twelve Peaks prepared their disciple attendance rosters, and all headed to the conference. The convening location of the Immortal Alliance Conference this time was a rolling mountain range extending for many miles, with complex terrain, named Jue Di 94 Gorge. People of reputation were conscious of their rank, and wouldn’t participate in the Immortal Alliance Conference, to compete with their juniors for the limelight. There was no need, and it would be below them. Therefore, the twelve Peak Lords and members of the same generation would not sign up. The cap on the number of spots was high, naturally the more the better; in the end the number setting out grandly for Jue Di Gorge, well-equipped, was actually one hundred. This many people flying on their swords would be too high-profile and disturb civilians, so they still traveled by carriage. A cultivation novel where they sat in carriages and rode horses all day! Shen Qingqiu could never understand why Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky made this kind of setup, but no matter how much it merited tsukkomi after doing it for three years he’d still run dry; the current him was already numb to it. The majority all chose to ride horses, bearing heroic and valiant. However, firstly, Shen Qingqiu was not good at riding and didn’t want to fall and break his neck; secondly, he disdained being exposed to the wind, sun, and rain as not comfortable enough, not elegant enough, and so wormed his way into the carriage under a crowd of watchful eyes. Someone else had long first entered the carriage; on seeing him lift the curtain with his fan and worm inside, she said with contempt, “A big, strong man, yet you’re still trying to steal my spot!” This woman with beautiful eyebrows, a full chest, and her hair piled high, was Xian Shu Peak’s master, Qi Qingqi. In the original work, Qi Qingqi and Shen Qingqiu had no real relationship, and very few interactions. However, these years Shen Qingqiu had occasionally worked with her; he found her straightforward and fierce, and got along with her decently well.Shen Qingqiu used his fan to shoo her into giving him room, while saying with perfect composure, “I am a sick patient.” Qi Qingqi moved to give him some room, but still refused to spare him with her words. “Pampered since young! To be this delicate and coddled, totally unlike a Core-Formation stage cultivator! Do you need someone to serve you snacks later?” Shen Qingqiu suddenly said, “Right. Many thanks to Shimei for the reminder.” While speaking he rapped on the carriage wall with his fan’s guard. A little while later, someone lifted the carriage curtain, and Luo Binghe smiled while asking, “Shizun, snacks, water, or is your waist sore?” A lively and energetic white horse, a handsome and extraordinary youth; with the sun beaming down from above, they seemed to shine before their eyes. Shen Qingqiu said, “Your Qi-shishu would like some snacks.” Luo Binghe immediately took out an exquisitely wrapped snack from his torso and offered it to them. Looked like he’d long prepared for this. He said, “If Shizun still has commands, please call for me.” Only then did he let down the curtains. Liu Qingge spurred his horse on past them, with a powerful and resounding hmph. Shen Qingqiu said, “That’s natural.” He lowered his head and opened the packaging. “Dragon’s beard candy. Not bad.” He turned to pass the snack to Qi QIngqi. “Want some?” Qi Qingqi found it hard to describe her current feeling. She felt that more or less, it was only indignation. Shen Qingqiu had actually managed to raise a disciple this considerate, and with such high spiritual strength. In truth that wasn’t the case. She just didn’t know there was a phrase that described this feeling, called “so flashy it blinded my dog-eyes 95 .” Qi Qingqi refused to look at Shen Qingqiu as he ate the dragon beard’s candy, still making a final struggle. “Even Mingyan is riding a horse!” As long as she could make Shen Qingqiu feel a little bit of shame, she’d win! It just so happened that Shen Qingqiu had nothing to do, and looked outside; indeed Liu Mingyan had her face covered with a veil, her personal sword “Sui Se” on her back, and sat straight on her horse; a faint breeze blew by, causing the veil to flutter, giving her the appearance of ethereal lightness. This picture was far too pleasing to the eye. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t helpbut look at her for a while, sighing, “Beautiful beyond comprehension.” Qi Qingqi made a “pah” at his face. “Don’t look at my beloved disciple with such covetous eyes!” This back-and-forth was heard by the nearby Luo Binghe, and his face immediately turned green. But Shen Qingqiu hadn’t noticed his expression at all, and simply started eating while watching her. He had the mindset of someone in a theater before the movie, eating popcorn and drinking cola while waiting for the ads to end and the film to begin: That was Liu Mingyan! The male and female leads in the same venue, how could there not be sparks flying or amorous feelings 96 budding between them! Luo Binghe saw that Shizun was staring at Liu Mingyan without pause, and his hand holding the reins couldn’t help but tighten, the knuckles turning white. “Beautiful beyond comprehension?” She’s not even showing her entire face. No matter how beautiful, can she be better-looking than me? Luo Binghe really wasn’t a narcissist, he’d just always known very well what he looked like. He didn’t gleefully revel in it, but he also wouldn’t downplay it out of false humility. After a long time with Shen Qingqiu still having no intention of moving his gaze, Luo Binghe really couldn’t stand it anymore. He lightly urged with the whip, and the white horse quickly moved forwards, so that its bridle was even with Liu Mingyan’s. Luo Binghe inclined his head and smiled, greeting, “Liu-shimei.” Liu Mingyan started, then gave a shallow nod, returning the greeting, “Luo-shixiong.” Oh oh oh, oh oh oh! It’s started it’s started! A day where he could see with his own eyes, peerlessly handsome men and beautiful women from a book walk together bridle to bridle, had come in his lifetime; Shen Qingqiu was secretly excited, and couldn’t resist stretching his head out further. Luo Binghe swept his peripheral vision over and saw that Shen Qingqiu’s gaze hadn’t moved, and instead was staring over even more intensely; black lines came down 97 , his heart stuffy and teeth itching; he laughed and talked with Liu Mingyan while sneakily moving their horses faster and faster, until they were far enough away that Shen Qingqiu could no longer see them withoutleaning his torso out of the carriage. Shen Qingqiu could only sit back down properly, disappointed. How could he forget, when male and female leads were cooing sweetly at each other, there would never be an obstructive, third-wheeling audience. However, this child had truly grown up, wanting to hide his romances from his elders… could it be that his rebellious stage had finally arrived?"
绝地谷。 绝地谷横跨了七座起伏的山峦，苍翠满覆。其中明涌暗流、瀑布怪石、幽谷高峰，错落无 致。势如其名，总有似乎 “ 被逼到绝境 ” 的地形，然而下一刻，又能看到天无绝人之路的峰 回路转。用沈清秋的眼光来看，实乃组团探险与居家必备之良品。 参会的新秀们在安排下整齐地站成阵列，包围住山谷前一方巨大的天然石台。 参会的主力是四大修仙门派。以苍穹山为首，紧随其后的是昭华寺，天一观，以及幻花 宫。 四派之中，苍穹山综合性最强，十二峰各有所长，多管齐下。寺和观那自然是和尚道士等 出家人士的大本营。幻花宫则比较复杂，门派指导思想五花八门，擅奇门遁术，和俗世交 集最多，术法水平如何不清楚，但是有一点毋庸置疑，它肯定是最有钱的一家。每次大会 都是他家出钱最多。 此外，还有数不清的中小门派参会。所以最后报名聚集到绝地谷的肯定有千人以上。 以往万籁俱静的清冷山谷入口，忽然涌入了这上千人，从未见过人的山中动物都被惊了出 来，各方面意义上都热闹非凡。 山谷入口四面早已搭起了高台，是供不参与大会的修士们观战所用，代表各派的彩旗在楼 台上招展飘摇。诸位掌门的特等位置在最高层，苍穹山一行以岳清源为首，在高台就坐。 沈清秋落座后，紧靠着他坐的一名气度雍容的鹤发老者与苍穹山众人招呼过，也对他颔首 道： “ 沈仙师。 ” 幻花宫的老宫主，即洛冰河亲生母亲的师父。沈清秋抱着一种围观皇亲国戚的心态回了 礼。 不久，一名幻花宫的门人走上石台。毕竟出钱最多，支持人由他们定，也没什么不妥。台 下千人渐渐肃静，聚精会神，听他宣读大会事宜。 此人功底颇为深厚，气息充沛绵长，整个谷口包括高高的楼台之上，都能把他的声音听得 一清二楚。 “ 大会为期七天。在诸位进入谷中后，将撑起巨型结界，罩住整个绝地谷。七天内，所有 进入绝地谷的参与者与外界单方面隔绝联系，无法获知外界状况，而观战者们却可以通过 投放到山谷上空的灵鹰悉知场内状况。 “ 谷中已被安置了超过百种的魔物，总数将近五千。每拿下一只魔物，就能从它们身上得 到一粒念珠。级别不同的魔物，念珠里蕴含的灵气也大有差别。每人手腕上可都串着金 丝？ ” 台下众人立刻齐齐举起手腕，展示腕间的金丝。看起来颇为壮观。 司仪继续道： “ 取得念珠后，将它串在金丝上，诸位的成绩就会在此处的排行榜上自动排 序。 ” 排行榜悬于高台对面。虽说有八张之多，不过万众瞩目的，当然只有第一张金字榜上的前 一百名，甚至只有前十名。所谓的文无第一，武无第二，就是这个道理了。 最后，那幻花宫门人严厉地强调道： “ 严禁门派之间斗殴抢夺念珠！一旦发现有私底下互 斗、以卑鄙手段抢夺他人念珠者，立刻取消参会资格，三届之内不予参会资格！ ” 三届，也就是十二年。 这些新秀鱼龙混杂，有许多年轻没见过世面，却也有不少老油条，爬摸打滚数年的无赖混 混，如果不禁止斗殴，恐怕整场大会将变得无比混乱，甚至闹出人命。因此，这个规定很 有必要。 沈清秋闲得骨头发痒，状似专注地凝视场下，早已神游九天。忽然近旁有几位掌门的女眷 窃窃私语。 “ 那是哪一派的弟子？生的好生俊朗。 ” “ 那身白衣真衬他，不比公仪师兄差呢。 ” “ 可是公仪师兄不但仪表非凡，更是灵力高强，怎么好拿来比呢？ ” “ 啧啧，你就见不得人家说公仪师兄不好吧？果然立刻就反驳了，承认吧！ ” “ 承、承认什么？死妮子，你说什么，敢不敢再说一遍？ ” 接下来就是一阵恼羞成嗔与嬉笑打闹。沈清秋一听便知，她们讨论的对象的正是人群中一 身白衣、清逸出尘的洛冰河。 事实上，不光她们在偷瞧谈论，连石台下参会弟子中，都有不少少女在悄悄注目洛冰河， 片片飞红，玉颊生晕。 虽然声音压得极低，但在座的修者都是何等人物，五感无一不清明至极，哪有听不到的？ 这几名女眷年纪太小才没留神，被人听去了私房话。还好长辈们都体贴地很给那位在已经 扶额假装小憩的掌门面子，个个都装作没听到，目不斜视。 有人为了打破尴尬，咳嗽两声，笑道： “ 各位道友不同往届一般，也来算上一算，此次仙 盟大会将有哪些新秀出世吗？ ” 沈清秋精神为之一振！ 这里说的 “ 算一算 ” ，可不是真的说掐指算算，而是  赌。 说白了，就是在你看好的新秀身上下注押宝。 修真者也是需要一点娱乐的嘛。况且，赌注也不是金银这种在他们眼里俗气的阿堵物，而 是法宝啊、灵石啊、甚至派弟子到对方门下进修的名额。也不会真赌什么至关重要的东西 ，但也算是仙盟大会的一个传统的助兴节目了。 庄重如岳清源一级的掌门自持身份，不会玩这些，不过自然有人愿意凑热闹，未过片刻， 看台上就热火朝天的下了几十注。不少人都在自家门下杰出弟子身上押宝，如齐清萋就押 了柳溟烟夺魁。 沈清秋根本不需要考虑，直接在洛冰河身上押了五千灵石。 如此大气出手，惊起一阵不大不小的涟漪。连岳清源都搁下了正与之客气寒暄的昭华寺方 丈，移来目光。沈清秋见他欲言又止，道： “ 掌门师兄，我只是随便玩玩。稍稍激励一下 冰河。 ” 柳清歌冷笑： “ 随便玩玩。你那清静峰，挖穿了有一千块灵石吗？ ” 沈清秋语塞。确实没有！ 此处下注，写几个字就成，事后再结，不需亮财明证。大家都是有头有脸的人物，不怕赖 账。他心知这是稳赚不赔的一笔，便把赌注往高了抬，反正别人不知道他到底有多少家 底。 岳清源估计是怕他们丢人丢到外面来，忙打圆场： “ 好了。低声。当然有。 ” 齐清萋过来插个嘴，一阵见血： “ 掌门师兄，你给啊？ ” 岳清源道： “ 我给。 ” 柳清歌： “ 输了算谁的？ ” 岳清源： “ 我的。 ” 沈清秋： “ 赢了算谁的？ ” 岳清源： “ 你的。 ” 协商完毕，除了柳清歌，皆大欢喜。沈清秋快快乐乐地下注去也。 诸修士都在心里嘀咕怎么从没听过洛冰河这个名字。其实怪不得他们，洛冰河现在行事风 格比较谦和低调，不愿居功，总是做完好事搞定任务就默默离开，名声总扬不起来，所以 未曾大放异彩。旁人不清楚个中缘由，就当沈清秋真的如他所说，只是图个彩头，激励徒 弟罢了。 而高台之下，新秀们齐声宣誓过后，就正式开始入场了。 因人数众多，因此分设十二个不同的入口，打乱了门派，分批进入。参会的新秀们紧张万 分地踏入了绝地谷的范围，开始征程。高台之上，早已功成名就的前辈们却注都下完了一 轮，好整以暇，切磋闲聊嗑瓜子儿的都有。 场内有上百只专人操控的灵鹰，爪部银环上镶嵌着特殊的晶石，翱翔之时能把下方的一切 人事景物尽收眼底，投射到高台前的数面晶石镜上，和监控仪器的效果差不了多少。 有人喜笑颜开： “ 果然，公仪萧一入场就是第一！ ” 金字榜之上，前十的名字都灵光璀璨。此时的第一位的名字已经变成了金灿灿 “ 公仪萧 ” 三 字。其后跟着一个数字 “ 十二 ” 。 也就是说，在入场短短不到半个时辰之内，他就除去了十二只魔物，拿到了十二颗念珠！ 连紧随其后的第二名柳溟烟，都只取得了六颗念珠，整整被他甩开了一倍。 晶石镜上，映出了一名白衣少年，身形潇洒如行云流水，出手却疾如闪电，刹那就将扑来 的凄厉怨灵斩得烟消云散。 听着耳旁赞不绝口的溢美之词，沈清秋笑而不语。 这位公仪萧，看起来很天之骄子霸气侧漏，其实呵呵，也就是个比自己级别强半个钱的炮 灰罢了。 他就是那种 “ 长得帅，家世好，天赋高，妹子喜欢，意气风发，少年得志，但是很不幸， 有主角在，你一定要成为陪衬炮灰 ” 的典型代表。尽管在场押他成为榜上状元的人最多， 但是很遗憾，这位在榜首呆不了多久就会被洛冰河踹下去的。 洛冰河的名字现在排在中游，后面的数字只有一个 “ 一 ” 。沈清秋却半点也不忧心。 他知道，今夜子时一到，等那一场惊心动魄的大 □□ 、大骚乱拉开序幕，洛冰河这个名字 ，将在榜上势不可挡！ 仙盟大会，第一日，临近子时时分。 一轮圆月金澄澄地悬于高天。看台之上，灯火通明。 沈清秋在数面晶石镜中，终于找到了一面镜子，映照出了此刻洛冰河那边的状况。 洛冰河正缓行于林中，一尘不染，未见倦色。目如星辰，仿佛能直直穿透晶石镜一般。 不过，他不是一个人。 大多数人都单独行动，人太多，合力打怪，取得的念珠该怎么分？或者，只和自己熟悉的 搭档、最多加三两个师兄师弟一组。 女修当然也有极厉害的，可是从整体上来说，实力不够硬，心理素质也不强，往往需要别 人帮忙。她们的组队对象通常是要好的师妹师姐，一路打闹玩笑不干正事，基本不成气 候。 然而，洛冰河这边，却跟了七八个人，而且不是柔弱女子就是年轻弟子。这状况很有些引 人注目，当下就有人连公仪萧的英姿都不看了，转来奇怪地打量这臃肿的团队。 其中，和洛冰河走得最近的是一名淡黄色衣衫、举着夜明珠负责照明的幻花宫弟子。,"CHAPTER 22: IMMORTAL ALLIANCE CONFERENCE PART 2 Jue Di Gorge. Jue Di Gorge spanned seven mountain peaks, overflowing with deep green. Scattered discordantly within were bright springs and dark rivers, waterfalls and wondrous stones, deep valleys and soaring mountains. As its name implied, it had a terrain that represented “pushed into hopelessness 98 ,” yet the next moment, you could also see paths winding through the peaks, unable to be extinguished 99 . In Shen Qingqiu’s eyes, it was an excellent essential for both adventurers and those going about their daily lives. The promising talents participating in the conference followed the arrangement and stood in well-ordered rows, surrounding a gigantic, natural stone platform before the gorge. The four great cultivation sects made up the main force of the participants. With Cang Qiong Mountain in the lead, following closely behind were Zhao Hua Temple, Tian Yi Monastery, and Huan Hua Palace. Of the four sects, Cang Qiong Mountain was the most comprehensive, the twelve peaks each had their own strengths, in multiple fields. Temples3 and monasteries 100 were naturally the headquarters of those who had become Buddhist monks and Daoist priests. Huan Hua Palace was more complicated: their sect followed the teachings of various different schools, had an aptitude for the Daoist art of concealment, and interacted the most with the secular world; the level of their techniques was not clear, but there was one point on which there was no doubt: they were absolutely the richest of the sects. They contributed the most money every conference. Other than them, there were also countless small and medium-sized sects participating. Therefore the final number of those who had signed up and gathered at Jue Di Gorge was definitely over one thousand. What had always been a silent, cold gorge entrance, suddenly burst with more than one thousand people; the animals that had never seen people before were all frightened out; it was unusually “lively” in all meanings of the word. At the entrance to the gorge, a high dais had long been set up, so all the non-participating cultivators could observe the battles; various colored flags representing each of the sects fluttered and swayed there. The seats of the sectleaders were all at the highest level; Cang Qiong Mountain’s delegation, led by Yue Qingyuan, sat down on the dais. Shen Qingqiu sat in the back, next to an elderly man of poised bearing and a head of white hair, who’d greeted their group from Cang Qiong Mountain earlier, and now also nodded to him. “Immortal Master Shen.” Huan Hua Palace’s Old Palace Master, was also Luo Binghe’s birth mother’s master. Shen Qingqiu returned the greeting with the mindset of someone meeting the emperor’s relative. Not long after, a member of Huan Hua Palace walked onto the stone platform. After all, they’d contributed the most money, no issue with letting them decide the host. This person’s martial foundations were deep, his breaths plentiful and long-lasting; everyone at the entire gorge entrance, including those on the soaring dais, could clearly hear his voice in full. “The conference will last for seven days. After everyone enters the gorge, we will set up a giant barrier, and cover the entire Jue Di Gorge. For seven days, the participants entering Jue Di Gorge will be isolated from the outside world on their side, unable to know the situation outside, but the observers will be able to know the situation within via the spirit eagles let loose above the valley. “Over a hundred types of demonic creatures have already been placed within the valley; the total number is close to five thousand. Every time a creature is taken down, you will receive a prayer bead from its body. With creatures of different levels, the spiritual qi within the prayer beads will also be vastly different. Is everyone wearing a gold cord on their wrists?” The people beneath the platform immediately raised their wrists together, revealing the gold cords on their wrists. It was quite a magnificent sight. The MC continued, “When you obtain a bead, thread it onto the cord; everyone’s score will automatically be displayed on the ranking charts outside. The ranking charts were displayed opposite of the dais. Although there were as many as eight, everyone’s attention was only on the first gold-inscribed tablet’s top one hundred names, or even only the top ten names. This embodied the idea of “no first place among scholars, no second place among martial artists 101 .” Finally, that Huan Hua Palace member stressed in a severe tone, “It’s forbidden for sects to fight over and snatch each other’s beads! The moment we discover those who fight or use underhanded methods to steal the beads of others, we will immediately revoke their rights to participate, and they will bebanned from the conference for three sessions!” Three sessions, meaning twelve years. These promising talents were like a mix of dragons and carp; there were many who were young and inexperienced, and there were also quite a few old hands, scoundrels who’d scurried about for many years; if they didn’t forbid brawls, they feared that the entire conference would become incomparably chaotic, to the point of lives being lost. Therefore, this rule was very necessary. Shen Qingqiu was bored to the point that his bones itched; he appeared to be staring intently the scene beneath him, but his mind had long wandered off. Suddenly from the side, several girls from one of the sect leaders’ inner circle whispered amongst each other. “Which sect is that disciple from? So incredibly handsome.” “Those white robes really suit him; he wouldn’t lose to Gongyi-shixiong.” “But Gongyi-shixiong is not only extraordinary in appearance, he’s also of incredible spiritual strength; how can you compare them?” “Tut-tut, you just can’t stand when others put down Gongyi-shixiong, right? Sure enough, you retorted immediately, admit it!” “Adadmit what? Stupid girl, what did you just say; I dare you to say it again?” A burst of ashamed, displeased anger and giggling play-fighting followed. As soon as he heard Shen Qingqiu knew their subject was the one in the crowd dressed in white: the refined, outstanding Luo Binghe. In truth, they weren’t the only ones secretly watching and discussing him: even among the participating disciples below the stone platform, many girls stared stealthily at Luo Binghe, jade-like cheeks dusted with blushing red. They kept their voices very low, but with the kind of cultivators who were present, their fives senses were all incredibly sharp; could any of them not hear? These girls were too young and so weren’t careful, letting others hear their private conversation. Fortunately these seniors were all very considerate and let their sect leader, who was already holding a hand to his forehead and feigning sleep, keep his face; everyone pretended that they hadn’t heard, gazes remaining unaverted. Trying to break the awkwardness, someone coughed twice, and said with a smile, “We fellow cultivators are from various former sessions; why don’t we also put down our predictions: which of this conference’s talents will stand out the most?” Shen Qingqiu’s spirits rose!The words had been “put down predictions,” but they weren’t actually talking about divining fortunes, and insteadgambling. To say it straight, it was about laying a bet on a talent you had your eyes on. Cultivators needed some entertainment, after all. Also, the stakes used for gambling were not tacky, monetary things like gold and silver, but artifacts, spirit stones, or even the names of disciples that would be sent to study under other sects. They also wouldn’t bet anything of vital importance, but this also counted as one of the Immortal Alliance Conference’s traditional entertainment programs. Those as dignified as a first-class sect leader like Yue Qingyuan would be conscious of their status, and wouldn’t play around with things like this, but naturally there were people willing to join in the fun; a short moment later the dais was roaring with enthusiasm, laying down dozens of bets. Quite a few bet on their own disciples, for example, Qi Qingqi bet on Liu Mingyan’s victory. Shen Qingqiu didn’t even need to think, and straight away bet five thousand spirit stones on Luo Binghe. Such a daring move stirred quite a ripple. Even Yue Qingyuan paused in his polite exchange of greetings with an abbot from Zhao Hua Temple, his gaze shifting over. Shen Qingqiu saw the way he seemed about to speak but didn’t, and said, “Zhangmen-shixiong, this is just for fun. To encourage Binghe a little.” Liu Qingge sneered. “Just for fun. If you emptied 102 your Qing Jing Peak, would there even be one thousand spirit stones?” Shen Qingqiu clammed up. Indeed, there wouldn’t! When placing a bet here, just writing it down was sufficient; the accounts were settled afterwards, and they didn’t need proof of funds. Because everyone was of name and reputation, there was no fear of debts being blown off. He’d known inside that this was a sure win, and so had raised the stakes; after all, the others didn’t know exactly how many assets he possessed. Yue Qingyuan was probably afraid of them embarrassing themselves before outsiders, and rushed to smooth things. “Alright. Lower your voices. Of course there would.” Qi Qingqi butted in, getting right to the point. “Zhangmen-shixiong, you’re providing?” Yue Qingyuan said, “I am.” Liu Qingge: “Who would the loss be on?” Yue Qingyuan: “Me.”Shen Qingqiu: “Who would the winnings go to?” Yue Qingyuan: “You.” An agreement was reached, and everyone other than Liu Qingge rejoiced. Shen Qingqiu happily went to lay his bet down. All the cultivators quietly wondered why they’d never heard of Luo Binghe’s name. You couldn’t really blame them, the current Luo Binghe’s style of doing things was more low-key and modest, unwilling to claim credit; every time he did a good deed or completed a task he would quietly leave; this prevented his reputation from growing, so his skills and talents had never shone. Outsiders didn’t know this reason, and assumed Shen Qingqiu was doing exactly as he’d said, just making a good omen to encourage his disciple. And below the dais, after the talents took their oath together, they formally entered the venue. The numbers were high, so twelve different entrances had been set, dividing up the sects and having them enter in groups. The participating talents, shaking with nerves, stepped into the area making up Jue Di Valley, and began their expeditions. On the dais, the members of the older generations who’d long achieved success had finished their round of betting, and sat with unruffled composure: some of them were even exchanging pointers, chatting, or chewing on melon seeds. Within the venue were more than a hundred, specially-controlled spirit eagles; the silver rings around their talons were inlaid with special crystals; as they soared a panoramic view of the people and scenery below was projected onto the dais’s numerous crystal mirrors, the effect similar to surveillance equipment. Someone smiled from ear to ear. “As expected, Gongyi Xiao is first place right after entering the venue!” On the gold-inscribed tablets, the first ten names all shone with bright light. At this time the first place had already changed to a golden-bright “Gongyi Xiao.” Right after it was the number, “twelve.” That is to say, within a short hour after entering the venue, he’d already eliminated twelve demonic creatures, and obtained twelve prayer beads! Even Liu Mingyan, close behind in second, had only obtained six prayer beads; a large gap of double the number had opened up. On a crystal mirror, a youth dressed in white was reflected, figure elegant and unrestrained like drifting clouds and flowing water, yet his actions were as quick as lighting; within an instant he’d torn a shrill-screaming banshee 103 intoscattered smoke. Listening to the unceasing, excessive praises by his ear, Shen Qingqiu smiled without speaking. This Gongyi Xiao, although he looked favored and blessed, overflowing with incredible presence, in actuality ah, he was only half a dollar better than his fellow cannon fodder, that’s all. He was the typical kind of character who “looked handsome, was of good birth, good talent, loved by girls, full of mettle, and accomplished in their youth, but unfortunately there was the protagonist, so they absolutely had to serve as his cannon-fodder foil.” Though he had the most bets for top ranker, sorry to say, he wouldn’t be first for long before Luo Binghe kicked him off. Luo Binghe’s name was currently in the middle; the number after it was only a “one.” Yet Shen Qingqiu wasn’t worried at all. He knew that once tonight arrived, once the curtains lifted on that breath- taking, climatic disturbance, Luo Binghe’s name would soar unstoppably up the rankings! The first day of the Immortal Alliance Conference approached midnight. A round, golden moon hung high in the sky. The dais bright under the lamplights. Among the many crystal mirrors, Shen Qingqiu finally found one displaying Luo Binghe’s current situation. Currently, Luo Binghe was slowly moving through the forest, spotlessly clean and without a trace of exhaustion. His eyes were like stars, and seemed as if they could see right through the crystal mirror. However, he wasn’t alone. Most of the participants moved alone: with too many people teaming up together to fight monsters, how would they divvy up the beads? Or they would only cooperate with those they were familiar with, forming teams of at most two or three shixiongs and shidis. Of course there were also incredible female cultivators, but looking at them as a group, their strength and mental fortitude was lacking, often requiring others to help them. Their teams were mainly composed of shimeis and shijies they got along well with, and spent their time playing around instead of working properly, and basically looked quite hopeless. Yet following after Luo Binghe were seven or eight others, and all of them were either delicate girls or young disciples. This situation drew a lot of attention; immediately some stopped watching even Gongyi Xiao’s heroicfigure, switching over to size up this bloated team, finding it strange. Amongst them, the one walking closest to Luo Binghe was a Huan Hua disciple in light yellow robes, holding a night pearl and lighting their way."
此女姿容端丽清雅，走起路来却微一拐一瘸，似乎脚崴了，应当是在应对魔物时受的伤。 她语带歉意道： “ 洛师兄，实在对不住，刚才蒙你相救，现在还要麻烦你，要不是为了保 护我们，你早就走出很远了 …… 是我们拖累了你。 ” 洛冰河答得很得体： “ 同为修者，相互照拂也是应该的。 ” 沈清秋早就对洛冰河前期的白莲花作风了然于胸，见怪不怪了。 他一边打怪，一边还要带着这些弱兵妇孺走，所以才导致一整天都排名冲不上去。否则以 他的实力，和公仪萧一争高下，完全无压力。要知道连明帆的排名都还不错 …… 但没关系 ，洛冰河有的是后劲儿！ 沈清秋完全都没想到要反省一下这种 “ 我徒弟全世界最厉害要不是他人太好太善良好欺负 你们都别想争过他 ” 的激愤心态算怎么回事。 岳清源笑道： “ 清秋，你这个小徒弟，品性倒是非常好。 ” 沈清秋展扇而笑，安然受之。齐清萋哼道： “ 便是如此。都不像是他教出来的。 ” 旁人也有交口称赞的。不过，倒未必有几分真心。品性再好有什么用？仙盟大会讲究的是 实力，洛冰河此举，在他们眼里未免有些幼稚了。 坐在沈清秋身旁的幻花宫老宫主看清晶石镜中洛冰河的脸，却是微不可察地 “ 咦 ” 了一声， 似乎险些要站起来。 沈清秋目不斜视，了然于胸：洛冰河相貌俊美，颇类生母，老宫主必然是看到这张脸，以 为是凑巧相貌相似的晚辈，怀念起了当年自己的得意弟子。殊不知，洛冰河正是他爱徒的 亲生孩儿。 而另一边，绝地谷中，洛冰河的内心已经在冷静地思考如何安顿这一众弱小的弟子。 于道义而言，他不能丢下这些入门尚不久的幻花宫弟子，可是，却也不想错过在仙盟大会 中表现优异、给师尊争光的机会。 洛冰河在这边想着怎么摆脱眼下的局面，沈清秋却以为他正在跟妹子擦出缠绵的火花。 这可是第一个和洛冰河滚床单的妹子啊！秦婉约，婉约小师妹啊！ 沈清秋对这个妹子的最深印象就是她帮洛冰河破了处。再然后就是日常后宫勾心斗角中受 害者的角色。也只有向天打飞机这种奇葩能把一本种马文的后宫偶尔写出甄传的味道。 我宁可看你花十万字描述鬼头蛛是怎么交配的也不想看纱华铃手撕秦婉约。谢谢！ 看这一行人俨然把洛冰河当成了救世主，跟在他身后寸步不离。沈清秋又不痛快起来。 这些弟子中，有些是真的一时不适应，发挥不好，再稍加调整就没问题的，却也有些是不 学无术、又不肯退出大赛，想抱着洛冰河大腿混点念珠和名次的。 换了黑化的洛冰河，分分钟全杀光也不眨一下眼皮。人善被人欺啊！ 走了一阵，趁着黑夜袭来的小怪基本都被洛冰河弹弹手指就解决了，剑都不用出鞘，速度 却仍提不起来。 原因？ 一名幻花宫的女弟子靠着秦婉约，抽抽搭搭哭起来： “ 姐姐，我脚好疼哦。 ” 洛冰河在前方，停下脚步，却没有转身，低头揉了揉太阳穴。 秦婉约一阵紧张，她低头轻声对那少女说： “ 婉容，忍一忍好吗？我们必须走快些。 ” 婉容妹妹嘤嘤道： “ 可是人家真的脚痛，走不动啦！而且走了一天，没地方沐浴，身上好 难受。 ” 队伍里不少没受过磨练的弟子都连声称是。如果沈清秋有直接评判的资格，早把他们的参 会资格作废、踹出绝地谷了。 这么容易脚疼来报名什么仙盟大会。报名就算了，为什么还要拖人后腿。看看人家柳溟烟 ，这差距真的不是一点半点，怪不得人家才是第一女主！ 不过他也拿这个秦婉容没办法，毕竟秦婉约、秦婉容这一对姐妹花都是洛冰河的后宫成员 ，按照国际惯例即便是作大死也不会死的。 沈清秋心里弥漫上一股奇怪的烦恼感。 冰河啊你 …… 你今后收后宫的时候也可以适当地考虑一下质的问题嘛 …… 不要见到是个长 得不错的妹子就往怀里带。为师看到你后宫质量这样参差不齐，很是心痛！ 秦婉约又看了一眼洛冰河的背影，悄声道： “ 小妹，我们已经给洛师兄添了很多麻烦 ……” 她还想仰仗着洛冰河，在仙盟大会中拼上一拼，求个名次。若是妹妹的不识轻重让洛冰河 感到厌烦，那就不妙了。 秦婉容天真烂漫道： “ 洛师兄人这么好，不会介意的，是不是洛师兄？ ” 洛冰河终于转过身，脸上仍是微微笑着，俊美无俦，无懈可击，没有说话。不知道为什么 ，秦婉约却暗暗打了个寒噤。 而秦婉容是个棉花脑子，见他笑了就当他同意了， “ 啦啦啦 ” 一阵风般的刮到附近一条小溪 旁。 来了！沈清秋眼神一紧。 洛冰河一愣，联系刚才的话，以为她要沐浴。还好这位小妹妹没奇葩到那个程度，只是甩 脱了鞋袜，把脚丫踩进溪水里。 这可是在上游，万一人家下游有人要喝水呢 …… 沈清秋默默在心里给下游的弟子点了个蜡。 她这么一带头，旁人也有好几个效仿的，一群人居然就这么开始嬉笑打闹起来了。 洛冰河见状，无奈至极，又不好靠近，只能远远地道： “ 夜间涉水不安全，诸位师弟师妹 还是尽快上来的好。 ” 沈清秋有点奇怪。原作之中，洛冰河应该没站这么远啊？他应该没记错，当时，洛冰河应 该是出于担心（或者是出于向天打飞机菊苣想要描写杀必死的私心），一起到了小溪边， 然后欣赏一出诸女从袜子一直往上脱的香艳大戏 …… 杠杠的足控福利！ 洛冰河相劝，那几人却欢声笑语都浪到这边来了： “ 没事的！洛师兄你也来呀！ ” 连晶石镜前的掌门们都无语了。 沈清秋面无表情。 洛冰河，你还不过去吗？你再不过去，就赶不上剧情了！ 秦婉约知道自家妹妹举止奇葩，小心翼翼地向洛冰河道歉： “ 洛师兄，对不起，师妹她们 这是第一次参加仙盟大会 ……” 当真楚楚可怜。她咬了咬嘴唇，仿佛忍痛做出了一个艰难 的决定，道： “ 若是洛师兄感到为难，扔下我们不管，你先走，也没关系的 ……” 这话配上泫然欲泣的表情太没有诚意了。但凡是个道德底线高于及格水准的男人，听到了 都不会有脸照做的吧！ 洛冰河还没答话，小溪那边突然传来一阵刺耳的尖叫。他脸色一变，抛下花容失色的秦婉 约，抢到溪边。晶石镜前的众人也悚然起来。 洛冰河横剑在前，沉声道： “ 怎么回事！ ” 溪中原本有五六名弟子在浴足嬉水，这时却不见了两个，其中就包括秦婉容。 沈清秋恨铁不成钢：你看看！叫你早点去吧？现在好了，好端端的一个老婆就这么没了！ 秦氏姐妹花凑不齐了今后的 3P 大戏怎么办？！ 怪就怪万万没料到，这一回，身在主角后宫团的秦婉容妹子，居然也会把自己作死！ 一名弟子尖叫道： “ 刚才不知道怎么回事，忽然水底一黑，师姐他们不知道被什么东西卷 进水里面去了！ ” 洛冰河迅速伸手还愣在小溪里的人拉上来。可他刚伸手去拉最后一人时，那个人仿佛脚底 一滑，瞬间栽倒，溪水没过头顶，就这么眼睁睁地消失在了所有人面前！ 与此同时，溪水中一阵黑气翻腾。沈清秋隔着晶石镜定睛一看，那是无数如女子黑发一般 顺滑的黑丝，黑丝之间渗出猩红的鲜血，被溪流冲淡，比贞子的头发还要浓密恶心！ 有人已惊呼出声： “ 女怨缠！ ” 而绝地谷中，洛冰河也迅速判断出了溪水中是什么怪物，剑气入水，喝道： “ 远离水边！ 是魔界的女怨缠！ ” 那大片大片头发丝一样的魔物在水底翻搅一阵，忽然吃饱了打嗝一般，咕噜噜地从黑丝间 “ 吐出 ” 几条东西。 三具已经被吸干血肉、只剩湿淋淋的皮包骨的尸体。 尸体上毛孔异常粗大，那是因为还有不少头发丝附在皮肤上，插入毛孔之中，如饥似渴地 汲取人肉身上的血肉和精气。 无孔不入，见洞就钻，是女怨缠最可怕的特性之一。 溪水边的弟子们被这可怕的景象吓坏了，林中一片哭喊尖叫，扑着躲到了洛冰河身后。秦 婉约见到妹妹尸体惨状，险些晕了过去。 幸好她很聪明地没真晕，不然这种兵荒马乱的场面，谁还能顾得上带着她一起逃跑！,"CHAPTER 23: ABRUPT CHANGE PART 1 The girl was graceful and elegant, but walked with a slight limp, like she had sprained her ankle; it was probably an injury she had sustained while fighting monsters. She said apologetically, “Luo-shixiong, I truly apologize. You saved us, and now we are troubling you. If it weren’t to protect us, you would have gone far ahead already… we are burdening you.” Luo Binghe gave a very proper response. “We are all cultivators, looking after each other is how it should be.” Shen Qingqiu had long understood Luo Binghe’s early-stage white lotus style like the back of his hand, and did not find this strange. He was fighting monsters while also looking after this crowd of weak fighters, women, and young disciples, hence he never surged up the rankings. Otherwise, with his ability, defeating Gongyi Xiao would be effortless. Even Ming Fan’s ranking was not bad… but it didn’t matter, Luo Binghe would have a second wind! Shen Qingqiu absolutely did not reflect on what this agitated attitude of “my disciple is the most awesome in the world; if he wasn’t too good, too kind, easy to take advantage of, none of you could even dream of defeating him,” meant. Yue Qingyuan smiled and said, “Qingqiu, this little disciple of yours has great moral character.” Shen Qingqiu smiled behind his open fan, quietly accepting the compliment. Qi Qingqi hmphed and said, “Exactly. It’s impossible to tell that he was the one who taught him.” Other people also said a few words of praise. However, they were not necessarily sincere. What use was good moral character? The Immortal Alliance Conference valued power. In their eyes, these actions of Luo Binghe’s seemed rather childish. But when the Huan Hua Palace Old Palace Master sitting by Shen Qingqiu’s side saw Luo Binghe’s face through the crystal mirror, he let out a barely audible “eh,” and even almost stood up. Shen Qingqiu did not glance over, but understood very well: Luo Binghe was beautiful, and looked quite like his birth mother. The Old Palace Master must have seen this face, and thinking he was a junior with a coincidentally similar appearance, became nostalgic about his own favorite disciple. He couldscarcely have imagined that Luo Binghe was precisely his beloved disciple’s child. On the other side, in Jue Di Gorge, Luo Binghe was already calmly considering what to do with this crowd of weak disciples. From a moral standpoint, he couldn’t just abandon these Huan Hua Palace disciples who’d barely started training, but he also didn’t want to miss the chance to shine in the Immortal Alliance Conference, and win honor for Shizun. Luo Binghe was considering how to extricate himself from this situation, but Shen Qingqiu thought he was rolling around with the sisters and setting off sparks. This was the first sister to sleep with Luo Binghe! Qin Wanyue, little shimei Wanyue! The deepest impression Shen Qingqiu had of this sister was that she helped give Luo Binghe a breakthrough. And then later, her role was to be a victim in the constant harem intrigue. Only someone as unique 104 like Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky could sometimes manage to write the harem of a stallion novel in the flavor of The Legend of Zhen Huan 105 . I’d rather see you write ten thousand words describing how ghost-head spiders mate than see Sha Hualing tear at Qin Wanyue! Thank you! Watching this parade of people treat Luo Binghe like their personal savior, trailing closely behind him, Shen Qingqiu grew unhappy again. Within these disciples, some truly hadn’t acclimated and so couldn’t demonstrate their skills, and would be fine after a little more time to adjust; but there were also some that were truly ignorant and incompetent, yet refused to back out of the competition, and wanted to cling to Luo Binghe’s thighs so they could fumble up some beads and ranking. If this was the blackened Luo Binghe, he’d slaughter them all in seconds without even blinking. People take advantage of kindness, ah! After walking for a while, every low-level monster using the darkness to attack had been eliminated with pretty much only flicks of Luo Binghe’s fingers; his sword never left his sheath. Yet, he still could not pick up the pace. Why? A female disciple from Huan Hua Palace leaned on Qin Wanyue and began to hiccup and cry, “Jiejie, my feet hurt so much.” In front, Luo Binghe stopped, but did not turn around. He lowered his head and rubbed his temples. Nervous, Qin Wanyue lowered her head and spoke quietly to the girl,“Wanrong, endure it a bit, alright? We have to walk a little faster.” Wanrong-meimei whined, “But my feet really hurt, I can’t walk anymore! We’ve been walking all day, and there’s nowhere to take a bath, I’m so uncomfortable.” Quite a few untrained disciples in the group agreed one after another. If Shen Qingqiu had the right to decide, he would have long revoked their right to participate and kicked them all out of Jue Di Gorge. If your feet hurt so easily, don’t sign up for the Immortal Alliance Conference. And if you do, then whatever, but why drag others down. Look at Liu Mingyan, this difference is more than a bit, no wonder she’s the number one female protagonist! But there was nothing he could do about Qin Wanrong. After all, the beautiful sisters Qin Wanyue and Qin Wanrong were members of Luo Binghe’s harem, and according to universal convention, no matter how hard they dug their graves, they would not die. Shen Qingqiu’s heart filled with a strange feeling of annoyance. Luo Binghe, you… in the future when you’re gathering your harem, can you consider quality a little… don’t just accept any decent-looking girl into your arms. Looking at how uneven your harem’s quality is, this master’s heart hurts for you! Qin Wanyue sent another look at Luo Binghe’s back, and said quietly, “Little sister, we’ve already made a lot of trouble for Luo-shixiong…” She still wanted to rely on Luo Binghe and stake herself in the Immortal Alliance Conference, earn some reputation. If her sister foolishly annoyed Luo Binghe, that would be bad for her. Qin Wanrong said innocently, “Luo-shixiong is such a good person; he won’t mind. Isn’t that right, Luo-shixiong?” Luo Binghe finally turned around, a faint smile still on his face, peerlessly handsome, utterly faultless, and did not speak. But for some reason, Qin Wanyue inwardly shivered in fear. But Qin Wanrong had cotton for brains and took his smile as acquiescence; with a “lalala” and like a gust of wind, she swept over to a nearby creek. It’s coming! Shen Qingqiu’s gaze tensed. Luo Binghe started; connecting her actions with what she had just said, he thought she was going to bathe. Fortunately, this little girl wasn’t that much of an eccentric 106 , and only shook off her shoes and socks to dip her feet into thecreek. These were the river’s upper reaches; what if someone downstream wanted to drink… Shen Qingqiu silently lit a candle for those disciples downstream. After she took the lead, many of the surrounding disciples followed her example, and this crowd of people actually started to laugh and play, just like that. Seeing this, Luo Binghe was completely helpless; it was awkward to approach them, so he could only say from far away, “Wading in the water at night isn’t safe; it’s best if everyone comes back up right away.” Shen Qingqiu felt this was a bit odd. In the original novel, surely Luo Binghe hadn’t stood this far away? He shouldn’t have remembered wrong: at the time, Luo Binghe, out of worry (or “Great Master” Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky’s selfish desires to write fan-service), had gone to the creek with the others. And then he had enjoyed the alluring show of all the women slowly rolling up their stockings… textbook foot fetish material! Luo Binghe pleaded with them, but a few of them had even crossed to the other side, chatting and laughing. “It’s all right! Luo-shixiong, you come too!” Even the sect leaders watching through the crystal mirrors were speechless. Shen Qingqiu had no expression on his face. Luo Binghe, you still won’t go? If you don’t, you’ll miss the plot! Qin Wanyue knew her little sister was being rather inappropriate,1 and cautiously apologized to Luo Binghe. “Luo-shixiong, I apologize, this is the first time Shimei and the others are participating in the Immortal Alliance Conference…” Truly lovable and pitiful. She bit her lip, like she was making a very painful decision, and said, “If Luo-shixiong feels burdened, leave us and go, it is alright…” These words, when together with that expression that was on the verge of tears, were too insincere. After hearing this, any man with a bare minimum of virtue wouldn’t have the face to do as suggested! Before Luo Binghe could reply, a sudden ear-piercing scream came from the creek. His face suddenly changed, and throwing down the Qin Wanyue whose beautiful face had lost all color, he stole towards the creek’s bank. The audience in front of the crystal mirrors also stood in terror. Luo Binghe held his sword before him and said in a low voice, “What’s going on!”Originally, five or six disciples had been washing their feet and playing in the creek, but now, two of them had disappeared, one of them being Qin Wanrong. Frustrated and disappointed, Shen Qingqiu thought: You see! Told you you should have gone earlier? Wonderful, a perfectly good wife is now gone, just like that! You can’t complete the Qin sisters bouquet for the future 3P grand show anymore; now what? Despite everything, he’d never thought that during this instance, Qin Wanrong who was part of the protagonist’s harem, could actually get herself killed! A disciple screamed, “I don’t know what just happened; the water suddenly turned black, and shijie and the others were swept under by something!” Luo Binghe rapidly went to drag the stupefied people still inside the creek up onto the bank. But just as he reached out to grab the last person, they fell over like they had lost their footing, the water closing over their head, disappearing with their eyes wide open, before everyone’s gazes! At the same time, a black smog billowed through the creek. Shen Qingqiu looked closely through the crystal mirror; it was actually countless black strands, smooth and silky like a woman’s dark hair; from between the strands seeped scarlet blood, diluted by the creek water; they were thicker and more disgusting than Sadako’s 107 hair! Someone cried out in shock, “Nu Yuan Chan 108 !” In Jue Di Gorge, Luo Binghe had also quickly identified the monster in the creek. He sent sword energy into the water and cried, “Get far away from the water! It’s the Demon Realm’s Nu Yuan Chan!” The billows and billows of the hair-like demonic creature swirled within the water for a while. Suddenly, like they were burping after a full meal, the black strands “spat out” a few things with a stream of bubbles. Three bodies had already been sucked clean of flesh and blood, leaving only drenched corpses of skin and bone. The pores on the dead bodies were abnormally large, and that was because there were many strands of hair still attached to the skin, thrust into the pores, hungrily sucking out the bodies’ flesh, blood, and spiritual essence. Leaving no pore uninvaded, diving into any opening they could find, this was one of the Nu Yuan Chan’s most terrifying characteristics.This scene scared the disciples by the creek witless, wails and screams filing the forest, all throwing themselves to hide behind Luo Binghe. Upon seeing the horrible state of her sister’s body, Qin Wanyue nearly fainted. Luckily, she was smart enough to not faint for real; otherwise, with this sort of chaotic situation, who would bother to help her escape!"
女怨缠水陆双生，在水底吸干了三个人后，迫不及待要爬上岸，寻找新的目标。洛冰河神 色凛冽，打个响指，指尖燃气一簇火焰，以灵气为催，弹向鬼鬼祟祟的魔物，一沾上头发 丝便蹿成一团巨焰，逼得黑头发丝迅速退回水中，不敢上岸。整套动作一气呵成，威力十 足，不留余地。沈清秋心内举牌：洛冰河，十分！ 洛冰河捡起因秦婉约慌乱而落地的夜明珠，高高举起，仿佛一盏明灯，定人心神，喝道： “ 不要走散，聚起来！ ” 随后，取出仙盟大会人手一只的标准配备，求救烟花，向天空放 去。 求救烟花是给弟子们在遇到无法对付的魔物所准备的求援物，仙盟大会不会投放过于危险 的魔物，用了三次之后就会自动弃权，因此，历届仙盟大会不到万不得已，基本没有人真 的使用，而此刻，整个绝地谷的上空，陆陆续续升起了朵朵灿烂的烟花。这原本是非常美 丽的场景，而此刻，这些烟花此时非但不绚烂，反而让人肝胆俱裂。 因为每一朵烟花升起，就代表一名弟子遇上了极其可怕的魔物，生命受到威胁！ “ 晶石镜！快看晶石镜！ ” 惨叫和呼号从晶石镜中不断传出来，有弟子已横尸当场，有的弟子则还在浴血厮杀，满眼 惶恐： “ 为什么？为什么在这里会有 …… 不应该啊！ ” “ 来人啊！师父救我！师哥救 ……” 忽然，一面晶石镜中传来嘶哑的叫声，灵鹰凄厉地长鸣，画面变成漆黑一片。 众人茫然道： “ 怎么回事？ ” 那阵嘶哑的鸣叫一定是魔界的骨鹰，一种凶残嗜血的飞天魔物。这只灵鹰，恐怕是被它们 撕裂瓜分了，晶石也摔得粉碎。 水里游的、地上走的、空中飞的 …… 这些凶残型的魔族生物绝对不会是大会安排的。 虽说早有心理准备，可当规模如此宏大的骚乱场面上演在面前，沈清秋仍是头皮发麻，指 尖冰冷地发现，他果然还是没办法像原先设想的那样，只当它是一场逼真的戏剧 □□ 。 而绝地谷外，高台之上早就炸开了锅。天一观的道人厉声道： “ 怎么回事？仙盟大会中选 定和投置的魔物都是经过严格规定和筛选的。怎么会混进女怨缠这种纯生魔界的东西！ ” 幻花宫弟子已死亡了好几个，老宫主霍然起身： “ 打开结界！ ” 笼罩绝地谷上方的巨大结界，是由近百名昭华寺僧人负责支撑的。昭华寺方丈立刻就要用 千里传音告知僧人们撤除结界。谁知，岳清源突然道： “ 不能开！ ” 老宫主愣住了： “ 岳掌门这是何意？ ” 绝地谷中有超过百名苍穹山派的弟子参加仙盟大会，岳清源却阻止开启结界，放结界中的 弟子们逃生，自然有非常的缘由。 沈清秋早已想通这一节，代岳清源答了： “ 一旦撤除结界，弟子们是可以出逃，但原本被 困在其中的魔物们也会四下逃窜。此处数里外就有村庄人烟，到时情况更严重。诸派门人 弟子至少有能力与之周旋，而那些不通灵力的普通老百姓 ……” 此言一出，高台上各位成名的先辈掌门都无言以对，静如死寂。这种时候，任你是再神通 广大的金丹元婴修为，也立即回天之力。 一名道人六神无主道： “ 不能打开结界放他们出来，那 …… 那到底应该怎么办？ ” 柳清歌道： “ 不能出，那就只能进。 ” 苍穹山众人默契十足地交换了一阵眼神。岳清源沉声道： “ 各位道友，今日之事，必然是 有心者刻意而为之，想借魔物之手，把修真界新秀和日后栋梁一网打尽。为今之计，只能 让结界继续维持。可有道友愿意与我苍穹山一同进入谷中，清理魔物，援救参会弟子？ ” 从里面杀出一条血路，把魔物们清理干净，不但需要武力，还很需要勇气。 老宫主第一个响应道： “ 幻花宫义不容辞。 ” 本次仙盟大会幻花宫参会人数最多，而且投入最大，他们是最无法承受折损的那一方。有 人带头，其他人立刻紧随其后，纷纷自告奋勇。就算有极少数原先心里胆怯的人，现在也 被点醒了：自家那些天资优秀的宝贝弟子们可都在里面呢！ 沈清秋上前一步，刚要站进志愿前去支援者的队列中，柳清歌微一错步，剑鞘挡住了沈清 秋的去路。 沈清秋不动声色，用两指拨开剑鞘： “ 这是何意。 ” 柳清歌言简意赅道： “ 你的毒。 ” 岳清源道： “ 不错。你身上 ‘ 无可解 ’ 余毒未清，清静峰一脉的弟子安危，就交给我们吧。 ” 万一在进入绝地谷后忽然发作，灵气滞涩，被包围在重重魔物之中，那可真是叫天天不应 ，叫地地不灵了。 沈清秋摇头道： “ 哪有弟子有难，师父却躲在高台上好乘凉的道理？倘若不能保护自己弟 子，我这清静峰峰主也不用做了。 ” 而且，他可是触发关键剧情的重要人物，不到场戏没法儿拍啊。 叮咚，系统提示：【通过塑造正面形象，使反派立体化， B 格 +30 ！】 沈清秋心内翻个白眼：这算是临头一刀之前给我发个糖吗。 岳清源等人劝阻无效，只得无奈道： “ 那你千万小心。万一不能应付，立刻传音召我们前 去支援。 ” 沈清秋对于自己处理魔物的水平，倒没有他们那么悲观。除了对自身修为的和灵力的自信 外，也是因为他对《狂傲仙魔途》中这些魔物的兴趣，远远大于各色妹子。他可能记不住 哪个女主收了小委屈的时候喜欢跟洛冰河到哪里去看星星，甚至有时候连名字都对不上号 ，但他对每一种魔物的属性和弱点，绝对都一清二楚！ 除了熟知剧情，如果非要在他身上找出什么能称之为金手指的东西 …… 就只有这一点了！ 绝地谷中，洛冰河正安顿一众魂飞魄散的师妹师弟。这种时候，千万不能四下乱窜，万一 遇上新的魔物或者再走散了，只能让情况更糟。 夜风猎猎，四面八方传来不知是人还是魔界生物的鬼哭狼嚎，胆子小的早已抱头痛哭。秦 婉约面色惨白，但见洛冰河靠在一棵树上，正阳剑插在怀里，镇定而不失警醒，挡住了来 自黑暗的一切侵袭，无助中又泛起丝丝柔情蜜意。 如果沈清秋在这里，他必然要激动不已，八卦之魂熊熊燃烧：妹子你已经爱上他啦！ 这时，灌木丛那边忽然传来悉悉索索的声响。洛冰河目光一凛，一道灵流汇聚在掌间，蓄 势待发。 那草丛簇簇而动的声音越来越大，越来越近，众人的心都提到了嗓子眼，也许是害怕到极 致了，居然谁都没有先叫出来。 突然，咚的一声，像是有人倒地。随后，一颗圆滚滚的东西滴溜溜滚出了草丛。 那是一颗人的头颅。 头颅双目紧闭，满脸鲜血，头发蓬乱的仿佛鸡窝。这画面原本很吓人，可这种时候，没有 杀伤力的死人脑袋，总比会吃人的魔物要好，是以居然不少人松了口气。 秦婉约颤声道： “…… 这 …… 这位师兄是哪派门下的，有人知道么？ ” 在场各派弟子纷纷靠近了点去辨认，都松了口气： “ 不是我们的人。 ”“ 从没见过。 ” 洛冰河望了望黑暗中的灌木从深处，心道头在这里，尸身也应当在这附近，不若去看看衣 着是哪一派门下。他加强了掌间灵流，朝黑暗中走去。 果然，一条僵硬的尸体躺在灌木丛后面，水蓝色的道袍，应当是天一观的入门弟子。洛冰 河只看见他袍子下摆，就叹了口气。这种入门等级的弟子，应当原本只是来仙盟大会长长 见识，却没想到被卷入一场飞来横祸，生生送掉了性命。 他再往上看，却猛地怔住了。 这具尸体的脖子上面，还好好地连着脑袋！ 那刚才那颗头颅是从哪里来的？ 洛冰河人未折回，正阳已出鞘，白光大盛中喝道： “ 离开那颗头！ ” 话音未落，原先静静歪在地面上的那颗头颅，突然睁开了双眼！ 它怒目圆睁与众人对视，脖子下倏地不知从哪探出了八条又细又长、骨节分明、长满倒刺 的蜘蛛腿，一跃而起！ 离它最近的一人来不及躲避，被它跳上了脑袋，疯狂大叫，噌的拔出剑来胡乱挥舞，旁人 忙不迭躲开。洛冰河不敢轻易出剑，万一刺中的不是那个怪物而是这个人的脑袋，后果不 堪设想。这么可怕的东西在自己头上爬来爬去简直恐怖得要窒息了，那人绝望至极，剑头 调转，往头上插去。可还没抬起手，那八条细瘦伶仃的蜘蛛腿找准了位置，对着他太阳穴 猛地插了进去！ 那人立刻僵硬了身体，连舌头都像是打了结，一句话都喊不出来了。那颗人头脖子下延伸 出的蜘蛛腿越插越深，他也跟着浑身抽搐不止。只得瞬息，八条蛛腿拔了出来，只留下那 人太阳穴处一派血肉模糊的孔洞，颅腔里面似乎已经被吸得一干二净，空空如也了。 这幅景象骇人至极，就连洛冰河都一时没反应过来。那颗人头蜘蛛模样的怪物吸饱了脑髓 ，在尸体上爬上爬下，嘴里发出凄厉的呼啸，仿佛婴儿哭号。 就在这时，一道灵流凝成的光箭飞来，穿过它正在发出长号的嘴，打了个对穿窟窿。 在一片戛然而止的寂静和众人茫然的瞩目之中，沈清秋揉了揉被它叫得隐隐发痛的耳朵， 慢条斯理一振袖子，折扇一展，幽幽地道： “ 吵死了。 ” 这个出场，当真十分之低调。,"CHAPTER 24: ABRUPT CHANGE PART 2 Nu Yuan Chan was an amphibious creature: after sucking three people dry underwater, it was itching to climb the bank and search for new targets. Luo Binghe’s expression was icily severe; he snapped his fingers, igniting a burst of flames at his fingertips, then boosting them with spiritual energy, flicked them towards the lurking demonic beast. As soon as they touched the hair-like strands the flames surged into an inferno, forcing the black mass of hair to speedily retreat into the water, afraid to come onto the bank. He’d executed the entire set of actions in a single smooth sequence, full of formidable might, utterly relentless. Shen Qingqiu internally held up a sign: Luo Binghe, ten points! Luo Binghe picked up the night pearl that Qin Wanyue had dropped in her panic and raised it high; it looked like a shining beacon, calming everyone’s hearts. He shouted, “Don’t stray, stay together!” And then, he took out part of the standard equipment for all Immortal Alliance Conference participants, a rescue firework, and released it into the sky. The rescue fireworks were given to disciples to ask for help if they encountered a monster they were not able to handle; the Immortal Alliance Conference would not release any excessively dangerous monsters, and using a rescue firework three times would automatically forfeit your right to participate; on top of that, the conference wouldn’t push you to such extremes, so no one really used the fireworks. However, at that moment, glittering bursts of fireworks rose one after another in the sky over Jue Di Gorge. This should have been a beautiful scene, but right then, not only did these fireworks not seem gorgeous, they even made everyone’s insides twist in fear. Because every blossoming firework represented a disciple who had encountered an extremely dreadful monster, whose life was in danger! “The crystal mirrors! Look at the crystal mirrors!” Blood-curdling shrieks and wails of distress came in an unending stream from the crystal mirrors. Some disciples were already corpses on the ground, some disciples were still struggling, soaked with blood, gazes full of terror. “Why? Why here… there shouldn’t be!” “Someone help! Shifu, save me! Shige, save…” Suddenly, a hoarse cry came from a crystal mirror, then the mournful shriek of a spiritual eagle, and the picture went out, becoming a flat, black screen.Everyone stared blankly. “What happened?” That hoarse cry was definitely the cry of the Demon Realm’s bone eagle, a type of aerial demonic beast that was both fierce and bloodthirsty. The spiritual eagle had probably been torn apart by it, its crystal shattered into dust. Ones that swam in the water, ones that walked on land, ones that flew through the air… these fierce demonic beasts were definitely not planned by the conference. Though he had made mental preparations long ago, when such an enormous scene of chaos played out before him, Shen Qingqiu realized, with his scalp numb and his fingers icy-cold, that he could not do as he’d previously expected, and just pretend he was watching the climax of an ultra-realistic show. Outside of Jue Di Gorge, pandemonium had already broken out on the dais. Tian Yi Monastery’s cultivators said sternly, “What is happening? The demonic beasts chosen for the Immortal Alliance Conference were set by strict rules and selection. How could something that lives only in the Demon Realm like the Nu Yuan Chan, mix its way in?” Many Huan Hua Palace disciples had already died, and the Old Palace Master shot to his feet. “Open the barrier!” The giant barrier covering Jue Di Gorge was supported by nearly a hundred monks from Zhao Hua Temple. The Zhao Hua Temple abbot immediately went to use a long-distance voice transferral spell to tell the monks to release the barrier, when Yue Qingyuan suddenly said, “You cannot!” The Old Palace Master started. “Sect Leader Yue, what is the meaning of this?” Over a hundred of Cang Qiong Mountain’s disciples were in Jue Di Gorge participating in the Immortal Alliance Conference, yet Yue Qingyuan refused to let them open the barrier so the disciples inside could escape; obviously there must be an exceptional reason. Shen Qingqiu had long figured it out and responded in Yue Qingyuan’s place. “Once you release the barrier, the disciples can get out, but the demonic beasts trapped within can also escape and scatter. There are villages only a few miles from here; the situation would become even more grave. Sect members and disciples at least have the ability to deal with them, but those common people with no spiritual energy at all…” After this, all the elders and sect leaders on the platform had no words of retort, and fell into a dead silence. At this sort of time, no matter how great your cultivation, Core Formation or Nascent Soul stage or whatnot, there was no wayto reverse the flow of events. A cultivator said, stunned, “If we cannot open the barrier to let them out, then… then what should we do?” Liu Qingge said, “If they can’t leave, then we must enter.” All the Cang Qiong Mountain members exchanged a look in tacit agreement. Yue Qingyuan said gravely, “Fellow cultivators, there must be someone behind this, hoping to use these demonic beasts to wipe out all of the cultivation world’s talents and future pillars in one fell swoop. For the sake of this moment, we can only maintain the barrier. But are any fellow cultivators willing to enter the gorge with my Cang Qiong Mountain Sect to clear out the demonic beasts and rescue the participating disciples?” To carve out a path of blood from inside, clear out all the demonic beasts, required not only martial power, but also much courage. The Old Palace Master was the first to respond. “It would dishonor Huan Hua Palace to refuse.” In this Immortal Alliance Conference, Huan Hua Palace sent the most participants and had invested the most as well, they were the party most unable to take this loss. With someone taking the lead, the others immediately followed, volunteers offering one after another. Even if there were a few cowards in the crowd, they would also be reminded: their own talented, precious disciples were all inside! Shen Qingqiu stepped forward, ready to stand with the group volunteering to provide assistance when Liu Qingge slightly altered his steps, and used his sword sheath to block Shen Qingqiu’s way. Without changing expression, Shen Qingqiu pushed the sheath aside with two fingers. “What is the meaning of this.” Liu Qingge said succinctly, “Your poison.” Yue Qingyuan said, “That’s right. Your ‘Without a Cure’ has yet to be resolved; as for the safety of Qing Jing Peak’s disciples, entrust it to us.” If his poison suddenly acted up after he entered Jue Di Gorge, with his spiritual energy stalling while surrounded by swarms of demonic beasts, then neither heaven nor earth would be able to help him.1 Shen Qingqiu shook his head and said, “How can a master hide and relax on a dais while his disciples are in danger? If I cannot even protect my own disciples, I don’t deserve to be Qing Jing Peak’s Peak Lord.” And, he was a vital character for triggering a crucial plot point, if he’s not on the scene they can’t keep filming, ah.Ding dong, System notification: Making the villain more three- dimensional by crafting an honorable image, B-points +30! Shen Qingqiu internally rolled his eyes. Are you handing me a piece of candy before stabbing me. Yue Qingyuan and the others had failed to dissuade him, and could only reluctantly say, “Then you must be careful. If you cannot manage, immediately use a voice transferral spell to call us for backup.” Shen Qingqiu was not as pessimistic as them about his own ability to handle demonic beasts. His confidence in his own cultivation and spiritual power aside, his interest in these demonic beasts in Proud Immortal Demon Way far surpassed his interest in all those flavors of women. He might not remember where each female protagonist liked to go stargaze with Luo Binghe after being slighted, sometimes to the point of being unable to match names to characters, but he definitely remembered each demonic beast’s attributes and weaknesses well and clear! His knowledge of the plot aside, if you had to find something about him that could be called his golden finger… it could only be this! In Jue Di Gorge, Luo Binghe had just calmed a crowd of terror-stricken junior disciples. At this sort of time, they must not fall into disarray: if they encountered some new demonic beast or someone else strayed away, the situation could only get more disastrous. The night wind whipped by, and wails and howls, impossible to tell if they came from human or demonic throats, sounded from all around. The faint- hearted ones were already curled up and sobbing. Qin Wanyue’s face was deathly pale, but seeing Luo Binghe leaning against a tree, Zheng Yang clasped hilt-up within crossed arms, calm yet on alert, protecting them against any attacks that came from the darkness, a trace of tender fondness couldn’t help but well up. If Shen Qingqiu was here, he would definitely get incredibly excited, his gossip’s soul blazing: girl, you’ve fallen in love with him! At this time, rustling noises suddenly came from the shrubbery. Luo Binghe’s gaze became severe, and he gathered some spiritual energy in his palm, waiting to strike. The rustling sounds in the brush grew louder and louder, closer and closer; everyone’s hearts were in their throats, perhaps they were all terrified beyond belief, because not even one let out a scream. Suddenly, there was a plop, like someone had collapsed to the ground.Then, a round object rolled out of the bushes. It was a human head. Both of the head’s eyes were tightly closed, its face covered in blood, its hair disheveled like a chicken’s nest. Normally this scene would have been frightening, but at this sort of time, a harmless corpse’s head was much better than a man-eating demonic beast, so quite a few even sighed in relief. Qin Wanyue said, her voice trembling, “This… does anyone know which sect this Shixiong belonged to?” Disciples from the various different sects stepped closer one after another to check, but all of them sighed in relief. “Not one of ours.” “Never seen him before.” Luo Binghe gazed into the dark at the depths of the shrubbery, thinking: if the head was here, the body should also be nearby; it would be better to go look at the sect uniform. He strengthened the spiritual flow in his palm and walked towards the dark. As expected, a stiff corpse laid behind the shrubbery, wearing aqua blue cultivator robes: must be one of Tian Yi Monastery’s newly-accepted disciples. Luo Binghe saw only the hem of his robes before sighing. Newly-accepted disciples like this one, must have only come to the Immortal Alliance Conference to gain experience, and had never thought that they’d be drawn into an unforeseen disaster and lose their lives. He looked further up, and suddenly froze in shock. There was still a perfectly good head on top of this corpse’s neck! Then where did that head just now come from? Zheng Yang had already left its sheath before Luo Binghe finished doubling back; as its white light overflowed, he yelled, “Get away from the head!” Before he finished speaking, the head quietly lying askew on the ground suddenly opened its eyes! With wide, glowering eyes, it met everyone’s gazes, then suddenly, eight spindly, segmented, barbed spider legs stretched forth from somewhere at the bottom of its neck, and it leaped up in a single bound! The closest person could not avoid in time, and it jumped onto his head; with a crazed howl, he drew his sword and wildly swung it around, causing everyone nearby to hurriedly move away. Luo Binghe dared not attack carelessly: in case he stabbed that person’s head instead of the monster, the result would be too horrible to imagine. Having something this terrifyingcrawling back and forth on your head would be enough to suffocate you in fright; in complete despair, that person changed the direction of his sword and struck towards his own head. But before he could strike, those eight spindly spider legs had found their target and ferociously speared into his temples! He immediately went stiff, and like even his tongue had twisted into knots, he was unable to yell a single word. The spider legs sticking out of that human head bored deeper and deeper, and his whole body began to twitch unceasingly. After only a moment, those eight spider legs drew back out, leaving nothing but the gory holes in his temples; it seemed like everything inside his skull had been sucked clean, completely empty. This scene was utterly terrifying; even Luo Binghe remained frozen for a while, unable to react. Having eaten its fill of brains, that human-headed spider- looking monster crawled up and down the corpse, letting out a mournful scream like a baby’s wail. Just then, an arrow of light formed from spiritual energy flew over, and pierced right into its still-howling mouth, skewering a hole clean through. Amidst the sudden silence and everyone’s dazed stares, Shen Qingqiu rubbed his sore ears, slowly shook out his sleeves, and with a snap of his fan, murmured, “Shut up 109 .” This arrival of his, was truly quite low-key."
“ 师尊！ ” 乍见沈清秋，洛冰河完全是喜大于惊。 毕竟，从骚乱刚一开始，他就料到沈清秋必然会不放心，要亲自来谷中救他们的。 沈清秋飘然立定，见数名弟子都围了上来，问道： “ 可有人受伤？ ” 洛冰河道： “ 除了溪边 …… 的那几位师妹和被吸髓而死的师弟，目前暂时没有其他折损。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 你受累了。 ” 洛冰河微微一笑，眼睛极亮： “ 弟子职责所在。 ” 沈清秋看了看还红着眼眶的秦婉约，心道你还笑，笑，知不知道自己死了个老婆啊？！ 众弟子见前辈高人出场相救，个个都像见了亲娘，就差没抱着他大腿放声大哭。沈清秋道 ：“ 你们不必惊慌惧怕。外面掌门们知道里面的情况了，已有大批前辈进结界来支援。你 们保护好自己，不需要多久就能杀出重围了。 ” 他这一句话仿佛定心大还丹，叫一群六神无主的少年少女们吃了好生心安。洛冰河道： “ 师尊，刚才那究竟是什么东西？ ” 讲起《狂傲仙魔途》里的魔物来，他可真是问对了人，沈清秋如数家珍道： “ 也难怪你没 见过，这东西叫做鬼头蛛。性情暴躁，面目狰狞，能作婴哭之声，用以诱猎物靠近。一旦 猎物靠近，头下吸盘就会牢牢吸住猎物的天灵，八条腿尖锐无比，能直接插穿颅骨盖，吸 活物的脑髓。 ” 洛冰河听他说得详细无比，又是敬佩又是称奇： “ 世上竟有如此邪恶的生物。弟子简直孤 陋寡闻。 ” 自从洛冰河拜了梦魔为师，在术法和剑法上沈清秋能指导他的是越来越少了，好不容易有 机会在徒弟面前摆摆师父架子，沈清秋暗中巨爽，觉得找回了久违的师长光环： “ 鬼头蛛 是魔族特产，不适应人界水土，已经多年无人见过了，一般的卷宗典籍自然少有记载。下 次你再见到，记得直接朝太阳穴打。刚才这一只只是雄蛛，幸好没遇上雌蛛，否则更可怕 ……” 两人还未多说几句，从四周众人头顶上的树叶中传来沙沙异响。 一颗颗倒吊着的头颅尾悬着白色蛛丝，从树中冒出头来。 沈清秋脸色大变。 鬼头蛛的叫声是会吸引大批同类前来围剿的！ 他手中折扇反手一推，扇出一道罡风，瞬间斩断数十根蛛丝，鬼头蛛们如同熟透的果实一 般，扑通扑通齐齐砸到地上。沈清秋喝道： “ 走！ ” 洛冰河利落地应了一声。趁鬼头蛛们摔得头晕脑胀，众人跑路。师徒一个在前开路，一个 在末断后，中间夹着臃肿的队伍，两端却杀得腥风血雨。鬼头蛛们行动敏捷，弹跳力极强 ，在半空中飞来蹿去，被二人交错乱打的灵流射成筛子。 一旦知道了如何应对，洛冰河便有如神助，简直闭着眼睛也能一次打穿两只以上，众人头 顶一片腥风血雨，哀嚎怪叫。 纵使如此，可毕竟数目太多，而且防不胜防。沈清秋正担心着那个见鬼坑爹的奇毒什么时 候发作，便觉灵力一滞，出手一下子打了个空。 还真是说什么来什么！ 沈清秋忙转法力输出为物理攻击，翻手扇缘便把那颗朝他扑来的鬼头蛛从中横切为两半。 洛冰河时刻注意着他那边的情况，见有异状，问道： “ 师尊？ ” 沈清秋忙道： “ 无事。你自己留神。 ” 幸好，他们已经被沈清秋带着撤入了一个特殊的区域。鬼头蛛们仿佛遇到了无形的屏障， 不敢再继续前进，反而嗷嗷鬼叫着一直往后退，直到退入灌木丛和树叶中，消失不见。 沈清秋松了口气。 秦婉约一面娇喘吁吁，一面疑惑道： “ 沈前辈，为何到了这里，那些魔物就不敢再前进 了？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 你们忘了，绝地谷之中，生长着什么异种奇花了吗？ ” 其实，忘了的是他自己。 原谅他真的记不住那朵花叫啥名字！ 洛冰河很贴心地帮他想起来了，一下就说了名字出来： “ 千叶净雪华莲！ ” 沈清秋总算知道他为什么之前记不住这朵奇花的名字了。 “XX 雪 X” 或者 “XXXX 莲 ” 这种名字格式的奇花，其泛滥之程度已经远远不是 “ 烂大街 ” 能形 容的。记得住才是有鬼！ 沈清秋： “…… 不错，正是千叶净雪华莲。此花长于绝地谷深处，已有千年之久，灵气非 凡，更是魔界物种的天生克星。它周围自然而然形成了屏退魔物的屏障。所以，只要在它 的屏障范围内，就不会受到太多魔物侵袭。 ” 洛冰河忽然追问道： “ 魔界物种的天生克星？ ” 他一直凝神听着，沈清秋见他目光中仿佛燃起了一簇星火，异样的色彩隐隐闪动，心下奇 怪： “ 不错？ ” 洛冰河道： “ 那师尊，这株千叶净雪华莲，能否解除魔族奇毒？ ” 沈清秋悚然。 这架势，洛冰河该不会是 …… 想给他摘奇花解毒吧？ 打住。原作里你为之摘花的妹子秦婉约可就在旁边看着呢，你现在当着她的面要给另一个 人，还是个大男人  摘花？ 给你老婆一点面子行吗？！ 沈清秋立刻道： “ 先应付过眼前的危机吧。 ” 洛冰河却不依不饶： “ 请师尊告知弟子。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 不能。 ” 洛冰河执着道： “ 莫非师尊试过？不试上一试，又如何得知？弟子知道师尊不想我冒险， 可如果不冒这个险，弟子永远也不能心安！ ” 这个真不是！ 你为什么非要在这个节骨眼上这么孝顺我老人家！！ 总不能告诉你要解毒解干净唯一的办法就是跟你啪啪啪吧？！ 沈清秋跟他说不清楚，寒了寒脸： “ 是不是为师平时对你太过纵容了，让你以为在这种时 候也能任性胡来。 ” 说真的，这几年来，出于诡异的预先赎罪心理，和其他感情成分，他绝没对这个徒弟说过 稍微重一点的话，是以洛冰河听了他这句后，先是一怔，果然勉强乖乖闭嘴了，可依然目 光倔强，正阳剑也不肯收回鞘中，明显不是退让的意思。 正当两人僵持不下。一旁的莽林中草叶蹿动，转出一个人来，身后还带着一众狼狈不堪、 经过一番浴血奋战的弟子。 沈清秋警觉地把目光移开，一跟他打了个照面，就觉得仿佛天降巨锤砸在他太阳穴上。 其实这人貌也算周正俊朗，只是言行举止之间，一股猥琐之气挥之不去。他见到沈清秋和 洛冰河，笑了一下，把光华流转的佩剑插回剑鞘， “ 原来是沈师兄。既然和你们汇合了， 那我就放心了。 ” 放心。放心个屁。有你在才不放心好吗！ 面前这个人，就是这场大骚乱的罪魁祸首！ 尚清华，这个在沈清秋心里被吐槽过 “ 上清华，呵呵，我还考北大呢 ” 的角色，乃安定峰峰 主。同时，他也有另外一重身份  仙盟大会祸事的内鬼，魔族数年前埋下的一颗棋子。 原本，尚清华只是安定峰一脉下一个籍籍无名的小弟子，被魔族要人抓到，逼他做卧底。 啊不，没怎么逼，他毫无心理压力地就乐呵呵地接下了卧底这个重任。 有了魔族作为暗中后盾，从此尚清华顺风顺水，一路青云直上，最后居然坐到了安定峰峰 主的位置。 可是，他还不满足。为什么呢？ 因为安定峰！ 一听这个名字，就知道不是什么有上进心的地方。这座山峰的传统与特长，跟它的名字完 全是一个画风  后勤工作。 理所当然的，全峰上下包括峰主也就成了块砖，哪里需要哪里搬。今天这里送几个苦力， 明天那里支援点物资。山门坏了？找安定峰修吧；差个车夫？找安定峰要人吧；这个月支 出超额了差钱花？找安定峰报吧。 这样一个峰主，即使业务能力上拳打蓝翔脚踢新东方，威风吗？气派吗？酷炫狂霸拽吗？ 有身为峰主的尊严吗？ 还不如别脉一个天资过人的小弟子瑟。 于是尚清华义无返顾地成为了魔族走狗。以帮助魔族称霸人界为己任，干尽坏事。 沈清秋一看见他就胃疼： “ 尚师弟。你来时，可有在附近见到大型魔物。 ” 尚清华一愣，道： “ 大型魔物？这个，倒是没有。 ” 沈清秋心中咯噔一声。没有吗？ 这里的 “ 大型魔物 ” ，也是剧情的关键道具之一。原作之中，洛冰河的魔族血统之所以会暴 露，就是因为仙盟大会里被放进来一只黑月蟒犀。 洛冰河为了保护众人，拼死战斗。黑月蟒犀杀伤力和体型都是巨型级别，他当然战不过； 战斗不过怎么办？爆种呗。 于是洛冰河就当着沈清秋的面，暴露了。于是沈清秋才有理由 “ 大义灭亲 ” ，一掌把他打下 去升级。 沈清秋刚才一直没感受到黑月蟒犀的魔气，更没听到传说中那谜一般的标志性 “ 似蟒又似 犀” 的对月长嚎。现在，尚清华也说没见到，不由他不警惕。没有这个关键道具的话，总 不至于要他毫无理由地就突然踹洛冰河一脚吧。 他忍不住看了沉默不语的洛冰河一眼。这孩子似乎还在解不解毒、摘不摘花的事上死磕， 看着他的目光执拗中，似乎还带了一点委屈。 委屈个毛线啊我这是为了你好，你摘花可以不要搞错送花的对象谢谢！ 尚清华痛心疾首道： “ 我过来的时候一路上已折损了不少各派弟子，这些都是修真界未来 的栋梁啊。放这些魔物进来的人当真歹毒无耻，卑鄙下流，丧心病狂！ ” 沈清秋无言以对。 那些魔物不正是你放进来的吗？用这样的词攻击自己真的没问题？虽然你自己不介意就好 …… 还没吐槽完，一阵毫无预兆的地动山摇。 众人东倒西歪，纷纷惶恐不知所措，询问声飞成一片。沈清秋则瞳孔骤缩。 这种 7.5 级的震感，绝对不会有错。 无间深渊，终于被打开了！,"CHAPTER 25: ENDLESS ABYSS PART 1 “Shizun!” Upon suddenly seeing Shen Qingqiu, Luo Binghe was far happier than he was shocked. After all, ever since the mayhem started, he’d anticipated that Shen Qingqiu would definitely worry, and personally enter the gorge to rescue them. Shen Qingqiu swiftly righted himself; upon seeing many disciples coming to surround him, he asked, “Is anyone injured?” Luo Binghe said, “Other than the riverside… those shimeis, and the shidi who died from being drained, at this moment we’ve suffered no other harm.” Shen Qingqiu said, “You’ve been put through much trouble.” Luo Binghe gave a smile, his eyes shining brightly. “This disciple was only doing my duty.” Shen Qingqiu glanced at the still red-rimmed Qin Wanyue and thought, you can still smile, smile, don’t you know that one of your wives is dead? Upon seeing that a powerful senior had appeared to rescue them, the group of disciples each acted like they saw their mother, stopping just short of clinging to his thighs and wailing. Shen Qingqiu said, “There is no need to panic or be afraid. The sect leaders outside know about the situation inside, and large numbers of seniors have already entered the barrier to help. Protect yourselves well; soon we’ll be able to break out.” These words of his were like a calming agent; the youths who’d been frightened out of their wits absorbed them and became at ease. Luo Binghe said, “Shizun, just now, what exactly was that?” When it came to Proud Immortal Demon Way’s demonic beasts, he’d really asked the right person; Shen Qingqiu spoke with great familiarity, “It’s no surprise you’ve never seen one; this is a ghost-head spider. Mean-tempered and with a terrifying appearance, it can mimic the sound of crying infants, and uses that to lure prey. Once the prey approaches, the suction pads below its head will firmly grip the top of the prey’s head; its eight legs are incredibly sharp, and can pierce right through skulls, to drain the brains of living creatures.” Luo Binghe listened to his incredibly detailed explanation, and was filled with both admiration and awe. “To think such an evil creature exists in this world. This disciple is truly too ignorant.” Ever since Luo Binghe started apprenticing under Meng Mo, the guidanceShen Qingqiu could give him on martial and sword techniques became fewer and fewer; now that there was a rare chance to show off as a master before his disciple, Shen Qingqiu was secretly incredibly gratified, feeling like he’d finally found his long-lost teacher’s halo. “Ghost-head spiders are a demonic specialty; unsuited to the Human Realm’s environments, it’s already been many years since any sightings, so naturally they don’t appear in most reference compilations. Next time you see one, remember to directly strike at its temples. Just now that was only a male one, fortunately we didn’t meet a female, otherwise it would be even more terrifying…” The two of them had yet to say much, when rustling noises came from the surrounding leaves above them. Heads suspended upside-down from threads of white silk, appeared one by one from the trees. Shen Qingqiu’s expression completely changed. Ghost-head spiders’ cries would attract large numbers of them to encircle and attack! He fanned outwards, releasing a powerful gust of wind and immediately snapping dozens of silk threads; like overripe fruit, the ghost-head spiders smashed into the ground with thuds. Shen Qingqiu yelled, “Go!” Luo Binghe quickly gave a reply. While the ghost-head spiders were dazed and reeling, the entire group began to run. Master and disciple, one in the lead carving out a path, the other bringing up the rear, together they sandwiched the bloated procession, the two ends slaughtering until it rained blood, the air thick with the smell of carnage. Ghost-headed spiders were agile with incredible jumping ability; as they flew and lept through the air, the disordered spiritual blasts exchanged between the pair punctured them until they became sieves. Once he knew how to deal with them, it was like Luo Binghe became divinely blessed, practically able to pierce at least two in a single blow with his eyes closed; the scene above their heads was a mess of blood and gore, anguished wails and monstrous howls. Even if that was the case, in the end there were too many, impossible to defend against. Shen Qingqiu was just worrying about that goddamned hack of a poison acting up, when he felt his spiritual power stagnate, his next strike suddenly coming up empty. Truly, speak of the devil! Shen Qingqiu quickly redirected the flow of his energy into a physical attack; with a flip of his hand, his fan sliced the ghost-head spider lungingtowards him horizontally into two. Luo Binghe had always been paying attention to his situation; upon seeing something was off, he asked, “Shizun?” Shen Qingqiu rushed to say, “It’s nothing. Focus on yourself.” Fortunately, under Shen Qingqiu’s lead they’d already retreated into a particular area. As if encountering an invisible barrier, the ghost-head spiders didn’t dare continue advancing, and instead wailed and howled while falling back, until they withdrew into the shrubbery and trees, then vanished. Shen Qingqiu gave a sigh of relief. Delicately panting with an expression of uncertainty, Qin Wanyue asked, “Senior Shen, why were those demonic beasts unwilling to approach after we came here?” Shen Qingqiu said, “Have you forgotten what kind of mystical flower grows in Jue Di Gorge?” In truth, the one who forgot was him. Forgive him for not remembering that flower’s name! Luo Binghe very considerately remembered for him, and spoke the name right away, “Thousand-Leaves Fresh Snow Lotus!” Shen Qingqiu finally knew why he couldn’t remember that mystical flower’s name before. “__ Snow _” or “___ Lotus,” mystical flowers swamping the work with this naming format were so common, they were already far beyond what could be described as cheap or tacky 110 . Like hell anyone could remember! Shen Qingqiu: “Correct, this is indeed the Thousand-Leaves Fresh Snow Lotus. This flower has grown within the depths of Jue Di Gorge for thousands of years; its spiritual qi is extraordinary, and furthermore it’s the natural bane of Demon Realm creatures. Its surroundings naturally form a barrier that repels demonic beasts. Therefore, as long as we’re within the protected region, there won’t be too many attacks from them.” Luo Binghe suddenly pressed, “The natural bane of Demon Realm creatures?” He’d been listening with rapt attention the entire time; upon seeing how blazing sparks had seemed to ignite within his gaze, a peculiar quality faintly flickering there, Shen Qingqiu thought it strange. “Yes?” Luo Binghe said, “Then Shizun, this spray of Thousand-Leaves Fresh Snow Lotus, can it cure demonic poison?” Shen Qingqiu was horrified. This attitude, Luo Binghe couldn’t be… hoping to pick the mysticalflower and cure him, right? Halt. The girl you picked the flower for in the original work, Qin Wanyue, is watching right next to us; and now you want to, in her presence, for someone else and a big, strong man to boot… pick the flower 111 ? Give your wife some face, alright? Shen Qingqiu immediately said, “We should handle the crisis before us first.” Yet Luo Binghe wouldn’t let it go. “This disciple asks for Shizun’s teaching.” Shen Qingqiu said, “It cannot.” Luo Binghe insisted, “Has Shizun tried it before? If we don’t try, how can we know? This disciple knows Shizun doesn’t want me to take chances, but if we don’t take this chance, this disciple will never be at peace!” This is really not the time! Why, at this critical juncture, must you be so filial to me! I can’t tell you that the only way to completely cure the poison is to papapa with you, right? Shen Qingqiu couldn’t say it to him clearly; his expression became cold. “Has this master indulged you too much normally, and made you think you can willfully fool around even at a time like this.” To tell the truth, over these years, due to his strange desire to preemptively atone, along with other sentiments as components, he’d never spoken even the slightest bit harshly to this disciple, so after Luo Binghe heard his words, he first startled, then as expected obediently shut his mouth; but his gaze remained obstinate, refusing to sheathe Zheng Yang, obviously unwilling to back down. Just as the two of them were in a deadlock, the dense overgrowth of grass and leaves leapt, and a person came out; behind him even followed a group of battered and exhausted disciples, who had gone through a bloody struggle. On guard, Shen Qingqiu moved his gaze away, and as soon as he came to face-with-face with that person, he felt like a giant hammer from the sky had smashed into his temples. In truth this person’s appearance could also be considered proper and handsome, just that within his words and actions, there was an air of sleaziness that couldn’t be removed. Seeing Shen Qingqiu, he smiled, returning his sword, flowing with light, back to its sheathe. “So it was Shen-shixiong. Being able to meet up with you puts my heart at ease.” At ease. At ease my ass. With you here I can’t be at ease, okay!The person in front of him, was the main culprit behind the huge mayhem this time! Shang Qinghua, a character that Shen Qingqiu had mentally tsukkomi’d before, “Goes to Qinghua 112 University, ahh, I even passed Beijing University’s exam,” was An Ding Peak’s peak lord. At the same time, he had another important identityhe was the spy behind the Immortal Alliance Conference disaster, a pawn planted many years ago by the demons. Originally, Shang Qinghua was only one of An Ding Peak’s many insignificant nameless disciples; he’d been captured by the demons, who forced him to be a mole. Ah no, he wasn’t really forced, he happily took on the important task of being a mole without even a hint of discomfort. With the demons secretly backing him up, Shang Qinghua’s road became smooth sailing, swiftly rising in rank, until he actually obtained the position of An Ding Peak’s peak lord. However, he still wasn’t satisfied. And why not? Because it was An Ding Peak! As soon as you heard the name 113 , you knew it wouldn’t be a place with ambition. This peak’s tradition and specialty, was completely along the lines of its namelogistics work. So of course, the entire peak from top to bottom, including the peak lord, were like bricks, and moved wherever they were needed. Send some cheap laborers here today, assist with supplies there tomorrow. Mountain gates broken? Get An Ding Peak to fix it; missing a carriage driver? Get An Ding Peak to send someone; this month’s expenses above quota and need more money? Get An Ding Peak to make a report. This kind of peak lord, even if their professional competence could trounce Langxiang’s and New Oriental’s 114 , were they impressive? Were they imposing? Were they cool, dazzling, badass, magnificent, awesome, or mighty? Did they have the dignity of a peak lord? Even a talented, low-level disciple from another peak would have more to brag about. So Shang Qinghua became a demon flunkey without hesitation. He took it upon himself to help the demons conquer the Human Realm, and did all kinds of evil. Shen Qingqiu’s stomach hurt as soon as he saw him. “Shang-shidi. When you came, did you see a large demonic beast nearby.”Shang Qinghua froze, then said, “A large demonic beast? This, there wasn’t one.” Shen Qingqiu’s heart thumped. There wasn’t? The “large demonic beast” here, was also one of the plot line’s key props. In the original work, the reason Luo Binghe’s demonic heritage was exposed, was because a Black Moon Python-Rhino had been released into the Immortal Alliance Conference. To protect the others, Luo Binghe fought a life-and-death struggle. The Black Moon Python-Rhino’s destructive power and body were both enormous; of course he couldn’t win. What to do if he couldn’t win? Activate SEED mode 115 . Therefore Luo Binghe exposed himself in front of Shen Qingqiu. And therefore only then did Shen Qingqiu have the reason of “punishing one’s own for justice,” to strike him down so he could level up. Up to now Shen Qingqiu had not sensed the Black Moon Python-Rhino’s demonic qi, much less heard that legendary mystery of a moonward howl, “like that of both a python and a rhinoceros,” which would indicate its presence. And now, Shang Qinghua said he hadn’t seen it, so he couldn’t help raising his guard. Without this key prop, surely they couldn’t ask him to suddenly give Luo Binghe a kick without any justification. He couldn’t help but glance at the silent, unspeaking Luo Binghe. This child was still struggling over the matter of whether he could cure the poison, pick the flower; there was a stubborn glint in his eyes, as if he still felt a little aggrieved. Aggrieved my ass ah I’m doing it for your own good; if you’re going to pick flowers don’t gift them to the wrong person thank you! Lamenting and full of grief, Shang Qinghua said, “On my way here we’d already lost quite a few disciples from various sects; these were all future pillars of the cultivation world. The person who released these demonic creatures is truly poisonous and shameless, underhanded and vulgar, cruel to the point of insanity!” Shen Qingqiu was speechless. Weren’t you the one who released those creatures? Are you really okay with using these lines to attack yourself? Although if you don’t mind, that’s fine… He hadn’t finished his tsukkomi when the earth began to shake without warning.Everyone staggered and fell all over the place, each terrified and at a loss, their questioning voices merging into one. Shen Qingqiu’s pupils contracted abruptly. This feeling of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake absolutely couldn’t be mistaken. The Endless Abyss, had finally been opened!"
所谓的无间深渊，乃是人界与魔界交界之处的空间。 作为一个过渡空间，无间深渊充满了危险与未知，处处是扭曲和撕裂的空间漩涡、烈火岩 浆。 在场的诸名弟子一路杀来，身心早已疲惫不堪，强震过后，居然倒下了大半，剩下还勉强 能站着的，只有沈清秋，洛冰河，尚清华三人。 无间深渊既然被打开，就说明，一定有魔族的东西从那边出来了。三人屏息凝神，戒备十 足，静静等待。 从黑暗之中，缓缓现出一个男子身影。 一看到那张冷若冰霜的脸和拒人于千里之外的神情，沈清秋就知道这是谁了。 他斜眼睨了一下脸色刷的苍白起来的尚清华，想笑却笑不出来。 为什么这个未来洛冰河手下为非作歹、杀人放火的好助手、好机油，会现在就出现在这 里！ 漠北君是个纯血魔族，正宗的魔二代，继承了家族在魔族疆界北方的领地，整天神出鬼没 ，无所事事，谁都爱理不理。如此特立独行的一个角色，被中期开挂的洛冰河暴揍一顿之 后，莫名其妙的就俯首称臣，任之驱使了。从此洛冰河就多了个看起来很的跑腿打杂的 忠实小弟。不过 …… 搞清楚，按照原著进度最起码还得五百章才轮到你出场好吗大大！ 尚清华抢上前一步，喝问道： “ 阁下乃是何人？为何出现在此？ ” 那不就是你真正的直属上司吗，放危险生物到仙盟大会里面的指令不就是他给你下的吗？ 请请请，你继续装。 漠北君微微侧首，俊朗的轮廓一半沉浸在黑暗里，让人心生寒意。他只抬了抬手指，尚清 华就被一股突如其来的猛力掼到半空中，撞断一颗古木，晕了过去，口中鲜血还是狂喷不 止，直喷得沈清秋忍不住心生敬佩： 太卖力、太敬业了。兄弟，为了业务，你也是蛮拼的！ 敬佩完了之后，暗叹一声。他就知道，还是要靠他出面。 沈清秋横剑在前，不卑不亢道： “ 魔族？ ” 这是句废话。那黑乎乎的团团魔气看不见就是瞎了。 一道白影闪过，洛冰河居然一语不发，挡在了他身前。 刚才还起了争执，现在强敌当前，却又毫不犹豫充当人墙，说沈清秋完全不感动，那是假 的。 只是越感动，越发觉得待会儿要做的事太不厚道。沈清秋宁可他无所作为： “ 冰河，退 下。 ” 洛冰河不回答，也不离去。与漠北君平平对视，居然丝毫不为他的威势所动。 漠北君 “ 咦 ” 了一声，像是发现了一点能挑动他兴趣的东西。 沈清秋道： “ 哪有徒弟挡在师父前面的？ ” 漠北君道： “ 你是苍穹山弟子？ ” 洛冰河冷声道： “ 苍穹山清静峰座下弟子洛冰河，领教阁下高招。 ” 漠北君嗤笑道： “ 仙者不仙，魔者不魔。有趣。 ” 沈清秋听到这一句，突然觉得揪住了点什么。 莫非 …… 出现在这里的漠北君，是来代替黑月蟒犀做推动主线的道具？ “ 仙者 ” ，说的应该是躺旁边装死还不忘吐血的尚清华，明明是修仙者却为魔族当牛做马， 的确半点不仙，不冤枉。而 “ 魔者 ” ，在场的除了洛冰河，还能指谁？ 沈清秋也不能确定，漠北君是否真能一眼看穿洛冰河的隐藏血统，心思百转。洛冰河见他 皱眉，以为他气自己不听话，道： “ 师尊，他不会让我们中任何一人走的，倒不如拼尽全 力与之一战。 ” 你说的很对，然而这并没什么卵用。沈清秋道： “ 你留在这里，只是白白送命。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 为师尊而死，或与师尊同死，弟子甘之如饴。 ” 漠北君蔑然道： “ 与我一战？ ” 后面那 “ 不知天高地厚 ” 很给面子地没说出来。沈清秋心道， 幸好你没说出来，不出三年，洛冰河单手就能揍得你爬不起来，你还不是老老实实给人家 做爪牙，妥妥的自打自脸。 漠北君： “ 也好，那我就看看。 ” 话音未落，空气中陡然杀气大增。 沈清秋步法莫测，瞬间闪到洛冰河身前，左手抛出修雅，不管顶不顶用先挡一阵再说，右 手拎老鹰拎小鸡一样拎了洛冰河就甩出去，把他送到漠北君魔气范围之外，转身就跟漠北 君一掌对上！ 两人双掌相接，沈清秋胸口一阵血气翻腾，就像被人当面打了一拳，浑身灵力都沸腾一般 滚滚不休。他虽然结了个丹修为已算相当不低，但金丹在未来灭世魔王洛冰河的得力助手 面前又怎么够看？ 可他必须得尽力拼一把！ 唯有不顾性命拼死一战，才是活命的可行之策。根据沈清秋看各种武侠仙侠小说十几年的 经验总结，这种设定为脾气古怪的中二枭雄类型，都会对血战到底不服软的臭硬骨头留几 分尊敬。而对软脚虾胆小鬼，那可绝不手下留情！ 洛冰河猝不及防，被沈清秋送出，半路折回，正阳出鞘。漠北君撤出一手，在迎面而来的 炫白剑芒上一弹，正阳剑身承受不住海量灌入的魔息，白光炸裂，当场断裂成数截。 他单掌与沈清秋双掌相对，却还压倒性占据上风，觉得没兴味了，发力震开沈清秋，道： “ 资质奇差。基础心法死板。滚吧。 ” 沈清秋： “……” 沈清秋的资质在人界不能说是空前绝后的奇才，起码也能说是千里挑一的优才；苍穹山的 基础心法那不叫死板，叫做正统！到了漠北君嘴里，就成了一坨垃圾。如果是原装货，听 了这话，必定吐血三升回去嘤嘤嘤扎小人。 洛冰河佩剑断裂，也不在意，但见到沈清秋被掌力震得内脏受损，齿间咬不住鲜血外溢， 眼神却陡然森寒起来，周身气场瞬间变化。漠北君觉察到这种骇人的异变，微蓝的两眼射 出兴动的冷光。忽然凭空凝出一支通体纯黑的冰剑，一生二，二生四，四生八，瞬间分裂 成数百把自称阵列的冰剑，从四面八方朝中央包围的沈清秋射去！ 这些冰剑普通的防御根本无法抵挡，因为它们是用最纯正的魔气凝成的。沈清秋现在灵力 将近枯竭，两者对上，正如星星之火与滔天巨浪这么悬殊的对比，结果如何，不言而喻。 剑阵如雨倾盆而下的刹那，沈清秋心中咆哮。 我已经尽力了，可人家就是觉得我战五渣，我也没办法！ 多大仇，要死也不弄个好看点的死法，这样一百多把黑乎乎的剑在身上捅，人都要被穿成 筛子，还能看吗？！ 然而，等了良久，也没等到万箭穿心的痛苦。 如果不是漠北君忽然抽风，撤回剑阵，那就只有一个人，一种可能，挡得住这一波杀气冲 天的攻击。 沈清秋稳住身形，慢慢抬起头。 果然。 四面八方的上空，密密麻麻的剑阵已然粉碎。 粉碎的非常彻底，仿佛消失无踪，夜空之中，只有漫天黑色的冰晶，反射着月光，点点落 下。 那画面甚至可以用美来形容。 然而，站在画面中央，周身和眼中仿佛都有一场暴风雪正在聚集的洛冰河，却只能用 “ 可 怕” 来形容。 沈清秋坐在一棵大树旁，边把淤血往肚子里吞，边运功疗伤，边观察这场劈山裂石的混世 魔王大战。 洛冰河的血统封印尚未解除，漠北君也只是在试探他，可依然打得昏天黑地日月无光，两 个人惊涛骇浪般的魔息溢出，几乎遮云蔽日。 这一带原本是千叶净雪华莲 …… 这玩意儿是叫这个名字没错吧？对，千叶净雪华莲的精华 范围，魔族生物们根本不敢靠近，可是被铺天盖地的魔气一薰，那朵灵气盎然的雪莲枯萎 得都坏死到根部了，那些黑暗中潜藏着的生物纷纷爬出来，贪婪地汲取对他们而言是芬芳 的气息。 有几只鬼头蛛偷偷摸摸爬到几名苍穹山派弟子的身上，毛腿子就要 □□ 人家太阳穴里，沈 清秋灵力差不多耗尽了，不能法攻，只能直接抓住它们污垢纠结的毛发就往旁边一扔。他 是看准了才扔的，就专门冲着尚清华这个叛徒身上扔！ 而那边，漠北君已差不多试出了洛冰河的底，打算收手给出最后一击了。他手指一弹，送 了一道猩红的光流种入洛冰河额头之中。 那道光流一与洛冰河额头相触，立刻浸入皮肤，化为一枚火红的纹章。洛冰河杀昏了头， 不知道那是什么，只觉得头痛欲裂，几乎要跪倒在地，浑身一股翻腾的残暴冲动无力发泄 ，随手一甩，爆发的魔气出膛炮般轰向漠北君。 这一下威力极大，漠北君举手化开，微微诧异，赞许道： “ 不错。 ” 他也不管现在的洛冰河意识清不清楚，自顾自道： “ 人界并非你应留之地，何不回归本 源？ ” 现在，沈清秋终于百分之百确认了。漠北君的突然出现，的确就是为了代替黑月蟒犀的作 用。只是比起原著，漠北君做得更彻底。他他他，他居然直接解开了洛冰河身上压制他血 统的封印。,"CHAPTER 26: ENDLESS ABYSS PART 2 The so-called Endless Abyss, was a place on the boundary between the Human Realm and the Demon Realm. The Endless Abyss, as a transitional space, was full of peril and the unknown. Vortices that warped and tore space, raging flames, and burning magma were everywhere to be found. The disciples on the scene had fought the entire way, and their bodies and hearts had long been completely exhausted. After that violent quake, most of them had tumbled to the ground; only Shen Qingqiu, Luo Binghe, and Shang Qinghua managed to stay standing. Since the Endless Abyss had been opened, this meant something demonic would definitely appear from the other side. The three held their breaths in anticipation, silently waiting in full alert. The figure of a man slowly emerged from the shadows. As soon as he saw that icy-cold face and aloof expression, Shen Qingqiu knew who this was. He shot a glance at Shang Qinghua, whose whole face had suddenly gone white, wanting to laugh but unable to. Why would Luo Binghe’s future subordinate, his excellent right hand and engine oil for committing evil deeds, murder, and mayhem, show up right here and now! Mobei-Jun was a pure-blooded demon, and very orthodoxly was heir to a demonic household; in the future, he would inherit his family’s territory on the demonic border in the North, then spend all his time appearing and disappearing at will, idling his time away, completely indifferent to everyone. And so this maverick of a character had been beaten up by a Luo Binghe who was in the middle of becoming overpowered, and unfathomably had capitulated to Luo Binghe, to be ordered about. From then on, Luo Binghe had gained a very badass-looking errand-runner and loyal sidekick. But… to make it clear, according to the timeline in the original, there should still be five hundred chapters before it’s your turn to debut, great master! Shang Qinghua rushed ahead and yelled, “Who is this distinguished sire 116 ? Why have you come to this place?” Isn’t that your real boss; wasn’t he the one who ordered you to release those dangerous creatures into the Immortal Alliance Conference? Please goright ahead and keep pretending. Mobei-Jun tilted his head. Half of his handsome silhouette sank into the darkness, a chilling sight. With a flick of his finger, Shang Qinghua was flung into the air by a sudden force, crashed into an old tree and fainted, blood spurting unceasingly from his mouth, spurting until Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but sigh with respect. Such effort, such dedication. Bro, you sure do a lot for your career! After paying his respects, he sighed again. He knew it, in the end he would still need to step in. Holding his sword before him, Shen Qingqiu spoke, neither humble nor haughty. “A demon?” This line was pointless bullshit. If you couldn’t see those murky billows of demonic qi you were blind. A white figure flashed past; without saying a word, Luo Binghe had moved to stand in front of him. They’d just argued, and were now facing a strong enemy, yet he was still playing the role of a human shield without hesitation; it would be a lie to say Shen Qingqiu was entirely unmoved. But the more moved he was, the more he felt that what he was about to do was really too awful. Shen Qingqiu would rather he had done nothing at all. “Binghe, stand down.” Luo Binghe did not reply, and did not leave. He calmly met eyes with Mobei-Jun, entirely unmoved by his power. Mobei-Jun let out an “eh” of curiosity, like he’d found something that aroused his interest a little. Shen Qingqiu: “What disciple has to shield his master?” Mobei-Jun: “You are a disciple of Cang Qiong Mountain?” Luo Binghe replied coldly, “Cang Qiong Mountain Qing Jing Peak disciple Luo Binghe, thanks this distinguished one1 for the guidance.” Mobei-Jun sneered. “The immortal acts unlike an immortal, and the demon acts unlike a demon. Interesting.” Hearing this, Shen Qingqiu finally caught on to something. Could it be… Mobei-Jun appearing here, was to substitute the Black Moon Python-Rhino as a prop for advancing the main storyline? “Immortal” probably referred to Shang Qinghua, who was lying off to the side and playing dead while still remembering to cough up blood; though clearly a cultivator, he tirelessly labored for the demonic realm, indeed completelyunlike an immortal; it was a fair accusation. As for “the demon,” who on the scene could this be referring to, other than Luo Binghe? Shen Qingqiu couldn’t be certain if Mobei-Jun could really see through Luo Binghe’s hidden bloodline with a single glance, and his thoughts twisted and whirled. Seeing him furrow his brow, Luo Binghe thought he was angry about his own disobedience, and, “Shizun, he won’t let any of us go; it’d be better to stake all our strength, and fight this battle together.” That’s true, but it’s also fucking useless. Shen Qingqiu said, “If you stay here, you’ll be losing your life in vain.” Luo Binghe said, “Dying for Shizun, or dying together with Shizun, is something this disciple is gladly willing to do.” Mobei-Jun scoffed, “Battle with me?” The following, “such foolish arrogance 117 ,” was politely left unspoken. Shen Qingqiu thought, good thing you didn’t say it out loud; in three years, Luo Binghe will be able single-handedly beat you until you can’t get up, and didn’t you still diligently become his henchman? You’d really be slapping your own face. Mobei-Jun: “Fine. Then let me see.” Before he had finished speaking, the bloodlust in the air around them surged. His steps agile and unreadable, Shen Qingqiu immediately flashed in front of Luo Binghe, tossing Xiu Ya forth with his left, to hold him off for a bit first even if it might be ineffective. At the same time he lifted Luo Binghe like an eagle would a chick with his right, then hurled him away; after sending him outside the range of Mobei-Jun’s demonic qi, he turned around and met palms with Mobei-Jun! When their two palms connected, blood churned in Shen Qingqiu’s chest as if someone had punched him there, all the spiritual energy in his body surging like it was boiling over. Though he had already formed a core and his cultivation was not low, what was a golden core to the future demon lord Luo Binghe’s right hand? But he had to go all-out and try! Disregarding his own life in a desperate battle to the death, was the only strategy for survival. According to Shen Qingqiu’s experience from ten-plus years of reading all sorts of wuxia and xianxia novels, formidable number twos with eccentric personalities would have some respect for hardheaded types who fight bloody battles to the end and refuse to admit defeat. But they definitely would not show any mercy to cowards and weaklings!Having been caught off-guard and hurled away by Shen Qingqiu, Luo Binghe doubled back, unsheathing Zheng Yang. Mobei-Jun spared one hand to flick away the advancing white sword energy; Zheng Yang couldn’t withstand the massive influx of demonic energy, and in an explosion of white light, shattered into pieces on the spot. He was holding off both of Shen Qingqiu’s hands with his one, but still overwhelmingly held the upper hand. Bored, he blasted Shen Qingqiu away, and said, “Unusually inferior talent. Foundation and techniques inflexible. Get out.” Shen Qingqiu: “…” Shen Qingqiu wasn’t some unmatched genius in the Human Realm, but his talent was still at least one-in-a-thousand. And Cang Qiong Mountain’s foundation and techniques were not inflexible, they were orthodox! Under Mobei-Jun’s description, it was all a pile of garbage. If the original goods had heard this, he would have coughed up three liters of blood and gone back crying to make a voodoo doll. Luo Binghe did not care that his sword was broken, but when he saw Shen Qingqiu injured by this palm strike, blood dripping from between gritted teeth, his gaze frosted over, the aura around him changing in an instant. Sensing this shocking change, a cold flash of interest shot through Mobei-Jun’s faintly blue eyes. He suddenly summoned a pure-black sword of ice out of thin air; that one became two, two became four, four became eight, instantly dividing into an array of hundreds of ice swords, then shot at the surrounded Shen Qingqiu from all directions! Normal methods of defense were utterly incapable of blocking these ice swords, because they were formed from the purest demonic qi. Shen Qingqiu’s spiritual qi was nearly exhausted; if the two collided, it would be like a single spark against a towering wave; what the result would be went without saying. The instant the sword array was about to come down like sheets of rain, Shen Qingqiu roared within his heart. I’ve done my best, but he still thinks I’m low-level trash, what can I do! How loathsome, if I have to die, couldn’t it at least be in a better-looking way; to stab me with hundreds of black swords like this, I’ll become a sieve; who could stand to look? However, even a long time later, the pain of being skewered by thousands of swords did not arrive. If Mobei-Jun had not suddenly changed his mind and revoked the sword array, there was only one possibility, only one person who could have blockedthis attack that surged with murderous intent. Shen Qingqiu steadied himself, then slowly raised his head. As expected. In the air all around him, the forest of swords had already shattered. They’d shattered so completely, it was like they’d disappeared without a trace, leaving only a night sky full of black ice crystals; reflecting the moonlight, they fell one by one. This scene could even be described as beautiful. However, Luo Binghe, who was standing in the middle of the scene, a blizzard seeming to roar around him and within his gaze, could only be described as “terrifying”. Shen Qingqiu sat next to a large tree, swallowing down mouthfuls of blood and circulated energy to heal his wounds, while watching this earthshaking showdown between two demon lords. The seal on Luo Binghe’s blood had yet to be removed; Mobei-Jun was only testing him, but still this battle darkened the sky and earth, blotting out all light; from both of them overflowed raging waves of demonic energy, enough to cloak the entire sky. This area should have been within the Thousand-Leaves Fresh Snow Lotus… that’s what that thing was called, right? Right, within the surroundings of the Thousand-Leaves Fresh Snow Lotus, demonic creatures would be afraid to approach, but as soon as this inescapable smog of demonic qi touched it, the Snow Lotus overflowing with spiritual energy wilted and rotted down to the roots, and all the creatures hiding in the dark crawled out one by one, greedily inhaling what, to them, was a fragrant scent. Several ghost-head spiders stealthily crawled onto a few of the Cang Qiong Mountain disciples, hairy legs posed to stab into their temples. Shen Qingqiu was nearly out of spiritual energy and was unable to use spell attacks; he could only directly grab them by their filthy, tangled hair and throw them aside. He checked before he threw, making sure to toss them onto that traitor Shang Qinghua! On the other side, Mobei-Jun had pretty much finished testing Luo Binghe, and preparing to wrap things up, sent out one last blow. With a flick of his finger, he fired a stream of scarlet light into the center of Luo Binghe’s forehead. Once that stream of light touched Luo Binghe’s forehead, it immediately seeped into his skin, turning into a fiery-red mark. Luo Binghe was lost inbloodlust; he didn’t know what it was, only that his head was aching like it was about to explode, and nearly collapsed to his knees. His entire body roiled with an urge for savage cruelty; unable to vent it, he threw out his hand, and an eruption of demonic qi, as if shot out of a cannon, descended upon Mobei-Jun. This last strike was extremely powerful. Mobei-Jun waved it away with one hand, a bit surprised, and praised, “Not bad.” Ignoring Luo Binghe’s current mental state, he continued by himself, “The Human Realm is not where you belong; why not return to your origins?” Now, Shen Qingqiu was finally a hundred percent sure. Mobei-Jun’s sudden appearance, was indeed to substitute for the Black Moon Python-Rhino. But compared to the original, Mobei-Jun had done his job more completely. He hehehe’d actually directly removed the seal suppressing Luo Binghe’s demonic blood."
而且完成公务，转身就走！ 这NPC 当得真的彻底干脆，毫不拖泥带水。和原著作风完全一致，哪里洛冰河需要，他就 会莫名其妙出现在哪里。就是如此牵强、如此特立独行、不需要逻辑！ 牵强的，只有沈清秋接下来要面临的，最后一关。 经历一场恶战、半跪在一片残垣中的洛冰河此刻看起来双目茫然，却像随时会撕碎一切。 他现在的脑袋就像是一座沉寂多年的死火山，突然裂地喷发，血管里岩浆流动。光是想想 ，就连沈清秋也似乎跟着烧得骨痛头痛起来。 系统发出前所未有的尖锐提示： 【警告！关键性任务： “ 无间深渊与无尽仇恨，漫天晶霜与漫天血泪 ” ，正式开启！如无法 完成，主角爽度 -20000 ！】 任务项目的名字一次比一次槽多无口是我的错觉吗？ 而且貌似前天我跟你确认的时候说的是 > 这才过了几天就翻了一倍？ 沈清秋颤颤巍巍走到仍处于半发狂状态的洛冰河身边，啪啪啪几巴掌打上他后背，把几道 残存的灵力拍进他身体里。 你以为这么简单就会起作用？想得美！ 洛冰河非但没清醒过来，他体内的魔气反而反弹出来，当场逼得沈清秋忍了良久的一口血 喷了出来。 直到这时，洛冰河才稍稍清醒了些。 他慢慢从混沌状态中抽离，能勉强拼奏出一些模糊的字句。那张熟悉的脸也逐渐清晰起 来。 沈清秋看他终于目光清明了一些，松了口气，抹了抹嘴边的血，语气平和： “ 醒了？ ” 顿了顿： “ 醒了的话，我们就可以好好谈谈了。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 洛冰河，你实话实说，你究竟修习魔族术法多久了？ ” 这句话一出来，洛冰河仿佛从窒息的高空，猛的坠入彻骨寒潭，想不彻底清醒都没办法 了。 他看着沈清秋那张冷若冰霜的脸，一颗心直坠下去。 以往沈清秋总会叫他冰河，而不会直接叫名字。 他低声道： “ 师尊，弟子可以解释。 ” 洛冰河虽然还是个少年，可向来都是镇定从容、少年老成的时候多，这时居然能见到他脸 上浮现慌乱的神色，像急着解释，又不知该从何说起。 堂堂男主，沦落至此，沈清秋简直看不下去，心中不忍，抢着开口： “ 住口！ “ 话音刚落，他自己都觉得没把握好，语气过于严厉了。洛冰河也似乎被他吓到了，像个被 打了一巴掌的孩子，懵懵懂懂，漆黑的眼睛就那么愣愣看着他，果然听话地住口了。 沈清秋狠不下心直视他的眼神，干巴巴念着台词： “ 从什么时候开始的？ ” “…… 两年前。 ” 沈清秋沉默不语。有问必答，如此诚实，看来他真是被吓坏了。 殊不知，洛冰河自动把他的沉默脑补为 “ 很好。你这孽徒，居然瞒我这么久！ ” 沈清秋轻声道： “ 两年，怪不得能突飞猛进到这种程度，洛冰河你，不愧为洛冰河，果然 天赋异禀。 ” 其实，这句真的是纯粹发自内心的感慨。作为男主，洛冰河的确是天赋异禀没错。若硬要 沈清秋说有什么意味，那就是羡慕加一丁点点嫉妒的意味。 可在洛冰河听来，意义却截然不同。 他一下子跪倒在沈清秋面前。 沈清秋老命休矣。男儿膝下有黄金，男主一跪没了命。到这节骨眼儿了再受他一跪，日后 洛冰河想起来岂非恨上加恨？他当即挥袖： “ 起来！ ” 洛冰河被他袖中罡风带得身不由己站了起来，连退数步，越发六神无主。 做错了事，错得没法挽救，连对师尊下跪请求原谅的资格也没有了吗？ 他喃喃道， “ 可是师尊你说过，人分好歹，魔有善恶。世上没有任何人 …… 天地不容。 ” 我说过吗？时隔多年，沈清秋认真想了想。 好像他真的这么说过！ 只是那时有那时日后长远的考虑，眼下却更有眼下刀口悬颈之危急。 虽是万不得已，可现在自扇耳光翻脸不认，会不会有些太不要脸了啊？ “ 你不是普通魔族。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 你额间纹章，是堕天之魔的罪印。这一支族系在人间造 过无数杀业，心性更是难以控制，自古以来，祸患辈出。无论如何，也不能和别的魔族相 提并论。我不能等你杀戮成瘾无法自控后，再证明我当初的话是错的。 ” 亲耳听到沈清秋这么说出来，将希望打碎，洛冰河的眼眶红了。 他颤声道： “…… 可你说过的。 ” 我说过的话多着呢。我当初还把说要阉了沈清秋的高亮红字刷了几百层楼呢。 …… 一点也不好笑。 一向很擅长自我心理调节的沈清秋今天吐槽的频率再创新高，疯狂刷新了记录，却怎么也 轻松不起来，反而有疲倦苍白之感。 他不断给自己洗脑：洛冰河现在所受的苦楚折磨，都是他日后踏于万人之上所必须经历 的。不经一番彻骨寒哪得梅花扑鼻香，不下深坑练三年哪来害世大魔王。心魔在手天下我 有，后宫三千不用日狗 …… 可是没用。 完全没用。 High 不起来。 沈清秋猛地抬头，捏了个剑诀，将修雅召回，提在手中。 他握着剑的手微微发颤，细微的筋脉浮现。洛冰河还不敢相信： “ 师尊，你当真要杀我？ ” 沈清秋不能看他的表情，目光直勾勾穿过他的身影： “ 我不想杀你。 ” 在洛冰河记忆中，从未见沈清秋有如此冷漠地对着自己的时候。哪怕是当初刚入苍穹山派 ，不受师尊待见，他看自己的眼神也绝不是这么空洞，视若无物。 不带一丝温度。和他以往看着那些十恶不赦即将被斩杀于剑下的魔物时，没有区别。 沈清秋道： “ 只是，刚才那人说的不错。人界终归并非你所能长留之地。你该回到属于你 的地方去。 ” 他走一步，洛冰河退一步，逼着两人退到了无间深渊之前。 一回头，就能看见腾腾的魔气在那道沟壑中翻滚不息，万灵哀嚎，朝上方人界的裂缝伸出 千百双畸形的手臂，渴求新鲜的血肉。更深处则隐没在黑雾和猩红的诡光里。 修雅斜指深渊之下，沈清秋道： “ 你是自己下去，还是要我动手？ ” 他很自私地希望洛冰河能自己下去。通常选择自己跳下悬崖的人绝对会被挂住，这样他就 可以自欺欺人地把这个画面 HE 化。 总好过从此以后，他日日夜夜都牢牢记着这一幕，记得是自己，亲手把洛冰河打下去。 可洛冰河依旧不死心。 他还不相信，对自己那么好的师尊，真的会把他推下去。不相信这么多年的朝夕相对，换 来的只是这样的下场。 就算修雅刺中了他的胸膛，他也还是抱着最后一丝希望。 沈清秋没想刺中他的。 真的。他只是硬着头皮挥挥剑吓吓他。只要洛冰河为了躲开往后一退，自然就掉下去了。 可他没料到洛冰河就那么沉默地站在那里，正面受了这一剑。 吾命休矣。本来只是踹下去，现在又多了一剑之仇！ 洛冰河反手握住剑锋，但没用力，只是轻轻握住。即是说，沈清秋如果想用力，修雅就可 以继续刺进去，直到穿透他的胸膛。 他喉咙轻轻颤动，一言不发。明明剑尖还没刺中心脏，沈清秋却仿佛感觉到他心脏痛苦的 跳动声，从剑身波及至手背，一路蔓延过整条手臂，直到抵达他自己的心脏。 沈清秋猛地拔剑抽回。 因为他的动作，洛冰河身形晃了晃，很快稳住。见沈清秋没有痛下杀手，他原本黯淡下来 的眼睛里又有亮光隐隐闪现，就像焚烧过后灰烬中垂死挣扎的星火，嘴角也勉强牵了牵， 不知是不是想露出一个微笑。 而沈清秋接下来，就要用最后一击，把他眼里这最后一丝余光生生掐灭。 他知道，自己永远也忘不了洛冰河坠下去那一刻时的眼神了。 等到绝地谷结界内清理完魔物的掌门及修士们赶到现场时，无间深渊撕裂处的空间早已闭 合。 除了装死的尚清华，沈清秋已经把晕倒在地所有人的伤口都处理稳妥了，自己一身伤却没 怎么理会，衣衫上血迹斑斑，面无表情，脸色苍白，看起来着实狼狈。 岳清源上前探他脉相，蹙眉让专业的木清芳过来察看。各派在地上横七竖八的人里各找自 家，认领然后抬走，进一步救治。 柳清歌发觉少了一人，还是时常跟在沈清秋前前后后无法忽视的一人，问道： “ 你那徒弟 呢？ ” 沈清秋低头不答，捡起地上断为数截的一把长剑碎片。清静峰的弟子们匆匆赶到，为首的 明帆眼尖，看了把那剑，支支吾吾道： “ 师尊，那把剑不是 ……” 当初，他对这把万剑峰上的正阳剑可是心心念念，想了多少年，被洛冰河拔出后嫉妒得烧 心烧肝，诅咒了无数个夜晚辗转反侧，自然不会认错。 宁婴婴忽然哇地一声哭了出来： “ 师尊你你别吓我。这是不是 …… 是不是阿洛的正阳啊？ 不是吧？不是吧？ ” 四下阵阵私语： “ 正阳剑？ ”“ 说的是沈峰主爱徒洛冰河？ ”“ 剑在人在，这剑都断了，人 呢？ ”“ 不会也 …… 咳咳。 ” 有人叹道： “ 果真如此，那也太可惜了，这一路下来，洛冰河都已经是仙盟金榜上的头位 了。 ” “ 天妒英才，天妒英才！ ” 叹惋有之，惊诧有之，悲从中来有之，幸灾乐祸有之。 宁婴婴当场原地大哭起来。 明帆虽然讨厌洛冰河，总是明里暗里骂他去死，但也从没想过真的要他去死，况且想到师 尊后来那么疼他，现在这臭小子却死得尸骨无存，师尊一定很难过，心情也好不起来。整 个清静峰一片愁云惨淡。仙姝峰都是女儿家，以齐清萋为首，也为之动容。 柳清歌不善言辞，拍了拍沈清秋的肩，道： “ 徒弟没了，还能再收。 ” 虽然知道他是想安慰自己，可沈清秋还是想送他个有气无力的白眼。 没把自己关门弟子兼男主踹下无间深渊的人，统统都是站着说话不腰疼！ 算了算了。已成定局。 沈清秋缓缓道： “ 清静峰座下弟子洛冰河，为魔族所害，身陨。 ”,"CHAPTER 27: ENDLESS ABYSS PART 3 And after completing his task, he turned right around and left! This NPC really played his role thoroughly; he wasn’t even the slightest bit sloppy. Completely identical to the original work: he’d show up wherever Luo Binghe needed him without rhyme or reason. His actions were just that forced, that maverick, not needing a shred of logic! Speaking of forced, that could only be what Shen Qingqiu had to face next, the last level. Having fought a harsh battle, Luo Binghe was half-kneeling in the midst of ruins, eyes vacant, yet he looked like he’d start rampaging at any moment. Right now his mind was as if a dormant volcano that had been silent for many years suddenly erupted, the magma in its veins starting to flow. Just thinking about this made Shen Qingqiu feel like he was burning up along with, until his bones and head began to ache and pound. The System sent a shrill notification of the likes he’d never heard before. Warning! Critical quest: “The Endless Abyss and endless hatred, a heaven filled with crystal frost and tears of blood,” has officially started! If completion is unsuccessful, protagonist satisfaction points -20000! The quest item name seems to get more and more tsukkomi-worthy each time; is that my imagination? And two days ago when I confirmed with you, didn’t it say 10000? After only a couple of days, it’s doubled? Swaying, Shen Qingqiu walked over to Luo Binghe, who was still in a half-crazed state, and aimed a couple of palm strikes at his back, channeling some of his own remaining spiritual energy into his body. You think it’s that easy? Dream on! Not only did Luo Binghe fail to regain consciousness, the demonic qi within his body rebounded instead, instantly forcing Shen Qingqiu to cough up the mouthful of blood he’d been holding back for so long. Only at this moment, did Luo Binghe finally regain some consciousness. He slowly pulled himself out of his muddled state, and managed to piece together a couple of mangled words. That familiar face also gradually came into focus. Shen Qingqiu saw that his eyes had cleared up a bit, and let out a sigh of relief; he wiped at the blood by his mouth, and said in an even tone, “Awake?”After a pause: “If you’re awake, let’s have a thorough discussion.” Shen Qingqiu said, “Luo Binghe, tell me honestly, exactly how long have you been practicing demonic cultivation?” As soon as this line was said, it was as if Luo Binghe had plunged from the stifling upper heavens into a bone-chilling pool; it was impossible to not regain complete consciousness. He looked at Shen Qingqiu’s icy-cold face, and his heart sank right down. In the past, Shen Qingqiu had always called him Binghe, and never his whole name directly. He said in a quiet voice, “Shizun, this disciple can explain.” Though Luo Binghe was still a youth, he’d always remained calm and unperturbed, often acting mature beyond his years; but now on his face actually surfaced an expression of panic, like he was frantic to explain, but didn’t know where to start. Seeing the magnificent male lead reduced to this state, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t stand to watch anymore; he burst out and cut him off. “Silence!” His voice had just left his mouth, and he already felt that he hadn’t controlled himself properly, that his tone had been overly harsh. He also seemed to have scared Luo Binghe. Like a child who’d been slapped, muddled and confused, he simply stared at him blankly with pitch-black eyes, and indeed obediently went silent. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t harden his heart enough to look him in the eyes, and stiffly recited a line, “When did you start?” “Two years ago.” Shen Qingqiu went silent and didn’t speak. To answer his question quickly and directly, as well as so honestly, it looked like he really was scared witless. Unbeknown to him, Luo Binghe automatically took his silence as, “Very good. You wicked disciple, you actually hid this from me for so long!” Shen Qingqiu said quietly, “Two years, no wonder you were able to progress in leaps and bounds to this extent; Luo Binghe you, as expected of Luo Binghe, you are truly gifted with spectacular talent.” In truth, this line of his, was purely to express the laments within his heart. As the male lead, Luo Binghe was indeed gifted with spectacular talent. If Shen Qingqiu absolutely had to describe what he was expressing, it was envy with a tiny bit of jealousy. But to Luo Binghe’s ears, the meaning was completely different. He instantly fell to his knees before Shen Qingqiu.Shen Qingqiu’s soul almost left his body. If a man kneeling was worth gold 118 , the male lead kneeling meant your life. Letting him kneel at this critical juncture, when Luo Binghe remembered in the future wouldn’t his hatred be compounded? He waved his sleeve at once. “Get up!” Hit by the gust from his sleeve, Luo Binghe couldn’t help but stand again, even backing up a few steps, even more stunned out of his wits. Had he done something wrong, something so wrong it couldn’t be absolved, that he didn’t even have the right to kneel and plead Shizun for forgiveness? He mumbled, “But Shizun you said before, that as people can be good or bad, demons can be good or evil. That in this world, there is no one… intolerable to the heavens.” I said that? It had been many years; Shen Qingqiu thought intently for a while. Seemed like he really had said that! But that was then, when he’d been considering a far-off future; this was now, in a crisis with a blade suspended above his throat. It was a last resort, but if he slapped his own face by doubling down, would it be a little too shameless? “You are not a normal demon,” Shen Qingqiu said. “That mark on your forehead, is the mark of sin of the demons who fell from heaven. This group has murdered countless humans, and moreover they have temperaments that are difficult to contain; from ancient times, they’ve been at the center of calamity upon calamity.” Hearing Shen Qingqiu say this with his very own ears, Luo Binghe’s hopes shattered, and the rims of his eyes reddened. His voice quivered. “But you said so before.” I’ve said many things, okay. Back then I even made several hundred posts in bright red font about wanting to castrate Shen Qingqiu. It wasn’t the slightest bit funny. Today Shen Qingqiu, who’d always been good at adjusting himself mentally, reached a new high in tsukkomi frequency, madly smashing through his old record, yet he still couldn’t put himself at ease, and instead only felt more tired and worn out. He unceasingly brainwashed himself: the suffering and torment Luo Binghe would go through now, was all necessary experience for him to stand above the masses in the future. Without going through the bone-chilling cold,how could there be the fragrance of plum blossoms; without entering the chasm, how could there be a world-destroying demon king. Xin Mo in hand, he’d possess everything beneath the heavens; with a harem innumerable 119 , he need not be a beta male 120 … but it was useless. It was completely useless. Nothing could lift his spirits. Shen Qingqiu suddenly raised his head and formed a sword gesture, summoning Xiu Ya to himself, and held it within his hand. The hand wielding the sword shook slightly, thin veins surfacing through the skin. Luo Binghe still couldn’t believe it. “Shizun, do you really want to kill me?” Unable to look at his expression, Shen Qingqiu’s gaze went right through his figure. “I don’t want to kill you.” Within Luo Binghe’s memory, he’d never seen Shen Qingqiu so cold and emotionless towards him. Even back when he’d just entered Cang Qiong Mountain Sect, when Shizun had disliked him, his eyes had never been this empty, like he was looking at nothing. There wasn’t even a trace of warmth. Exactly the way he’d looked at those heinous demons that were to be executed by sword in the past. Shen Qingqiu said, “Only, what that man just said was not wrong. The Human Realm is not a place where you can stay. You should return to the place you belong.” He stepped forward, Luo Binghe stepped back, pressing the two of them backwards until they were right before the Endless Abyss. Looking back, one could see the simmering demonic qi roiling unceasingly within that ravine, the anguished wailing of tens of thousands of spirits, the hundreds and thousands of deformed arms reaching up from the cracks towards the Human Realm, hungering for fresh blood and flesh. The deeper regions faded into black fog and eerie, scarlet light. Xiu Ya pointing into the Abyss, Shen Qingqiu said, “Will you go down yourself, or must I force you?” He very selfishly wished that Luo Binghe would go down by himself. Normally people who choose to jump down cliffs themselves would always be caught on something; this way he could believe his own lies and give this scene a happy end. Better than this scene being carved into his memory from here on out, to remember night and day that he himself had shoved Luo Binghe down with his own two hands.But Luo Binghe still refused to accept it. He still refused to believe that the Shizun who had been so kind to him, would actually shove him down. He refused to believe that all those years of interactions, spanning morning to evening, would lead to this kind of conclusion. Even as Xiu Ya stabbed into his chest, he still clung onto a very last strand of hope. Shen Qingqiu hadn’t meant to stab him. He really hadn’t. He was only steeling himself, waving his sword around in order to scare him. As long as Luo Binghe stepped back once more to avoid it, he’d naturally fall in. But Shen Qingqiu had never predicted that Luo Binghe would simply silently stand there, taking the blade head-on. It’s all over. Originally he was only kicked down; now there’s an extra stab added onto the grudges! Luo Binghe turned his hand over to grip the blade, but didn’t use any strength, and only lightly held it. Which meant, if Shen Qingqiu decided to exert force, Xiu Ya could continue to stab into him, until it pierced straight through his chest. His throat lightly bobbed; he said not a single word. The blade point clearly hadn’t pierced his heart, yet Shen Qingqiu felt like he could feel that heart’s painful thumps, traveling up the blade and into his arm, spreading through his entire arm, until it directly arrived at his own heart. Shen Qingqiu suddenly withdrew the sword. Due to his actions, Luo Binghe’s body swayed a little, but he very quickly steadied himself. Seeing that Shen Qingqiu hadn’t dealt the killing blow, his eyes that had originally dimmed faintly shone once more, like sparks struggling within burnt ashes; the corner of his mouth also managed to twitch. Perhaps he was trying to smile. And next, Shen Qingqiu would use a final strike, and extinguish that last trace of light within his eyes. He knew he would never forget Luo Binghe’s expression, from that moment as he fell. By the time the sect leaders and cultivators arrived, having finished clearing out the demons within Jue Di Gorge’s barrier, the space split open by the Endless Abyss had long closed. Other than Shang Qinghua who was playing dead, Shen Qingqiu had already stabilized the injuries of everyone who’d passed out, but he hadn’t really paid attention to his own; with his robes were splattered with blood, his faceexpressionless and stark-white, he looked quite wretched. Yue Qingyuan stepped forward to check his pulse and condition, then frowned and asked Mu Qingfang, as the expert, to examine him. Liu Qingge sensed that they were short one person, and it was the person who’d often flitted around Shen Qingqiu, impossible to miss; he asked, “Where’s your disciple?” Head lowered, Shen Qingqiu didn’t answer, and picked up the shattered pieces of a longsword lying on the ground, that had broken into many segments. Qing Jing Peak’s disciples hurried forwards; the sharp-eyed Ming Fan leading them looked at that sword and stammered, “Shizun, that sword can’t be…” Back then, he’d yearned for this Zheng Yang sword that was on Wan Jian Peak, and spent many years thinking about it; after Luo Binghe had pulled it his entire body had burned with jealousy, and for many nights he’d curse while tossing and turning, so he definitely wouldn’t mistake it. Ning Yingying suddenly gave a loud wail. “Shizun, don’t scare me. Is this… Is this A-Luo’s Zheng Yang? It can’t be, right? It can’t be?” Bursts of whispers came from around them. “Zheng Yang sword?” “They’re talking about Peak Lord Shen’s beloved disciple, Luo Binghe?” “The sword exists together with the person; the sword is already broken, so where is he?” “Could he have… ahem.” Someone sighed while saying, “If it really was so, that is truly a great pity; with this course of events, Luo Binghe has already become the Immortal Alliance Conference’s top ranker.” “Heaven envies talent, heaven envies talent!” There were those who sighed in pity, those who were stunned, those who were sorrowful, and those who rejoiced in the misfortune of others. Ning Yingying started crying loudly on the spot. Though Ming Fan hated Luo Binghe, and was always secretly cursing at him to go die, he’d never really wanted him dead; moreover thinking about how much Shizun had adored him later, and now this stinking brat had died without even leaving a corpse, Shizun must be terribly sad, his mood inconsolable. Gloom and worry cloaked Qing Jing Peak’s entire group. Xian Shu Peak’s group were all women; with Qi Qingqi as the head, they were also deeply moved. Liu Qingge wasn’t good with words; he patted Shen Qingqiu’s shoulder and said, “Your disciple is gone, but you can still accept more.” Though he knew Liu Qingge was trying to comfort him, Shen Qingqiu still wanted to feebly roll his eyes at him.People who didn’t kick down their final disciple doubling as the male lead, into the Endless Abyss, are all just talking from the sidelines! Whatever. The ending has already been set. Shen Qingqiu slowly said, “Qing Jing Peak’s disciple Luo Binghe, fell to the demons and perished.”"
此次仙盟大会，是开办历届以来损伤最为惨重的一年。 各派参会新秀共计千余，专心做结界人力柱的昭华寺得以幸免，幻花宫最惨，折损近百人 ，苍穹山最轻，只有三十余名伤者。 至于其余的杂门杂派，功力浅薄术法低微的新人基本都集中在这一块，这才是真正的伤亡 重灾区。 原本登上金榜是大喜之事，可如今再看，金榜上竟然有不少人都在绝地谷中身陨。尤其是 高悬榜首的第一名，苍穹山清静峰座下弟子，沈清秋爱徒洛冰河，剑断人亡，如何不令人 心痛。 而这些，还未将事发后入场救援的修士们的折损计算在内。经此一役，各派可说元气大 伤。 清静峰被送上来一张红榜。 红榜之上，第一名的 “ 洛冰河 ” 高高在上，金光耀眼。 明帆走近来，禀告道： “ 师尊，有一万灵石送上来了，该怎么安置？ ” 一万灵石？沈清秋愣道： “ 为何突然有这么多灵石送上山来？ ” 明帆小心翼翼道： “ 师尊你忘了？仙盟大会上，师尊你押了五千 ……” 沈清秋想起来了。是他押在洛冰河身上的那份注。岳清源说过输了算他的，赢了算自己 的。 洛冰河果然争气得很，在最后的半个时辰发力，直接越过了第一和第二的公仪萧、柳溟烟 ，高居榜首，给他翻倍赚了回来。 当时明明是抱着赚一笔是一笔、图个慰藉的心态，如今他却有点不知所措了。 而且以往，这些东西他都是交给洛冰河打点，该整理入库还是用来做些别的什么、怎么做 ，都不用他操心。现在却变成明帆问他该怎么处置。 沈清秋想了想，道： “ 先收着吧。 ” “……” 明帆其实还想问详细些 “ 收哪儿去 ” ，可师尊脸色实在说不上好，没敢再继续问下去 ，心想洛冰河以前放哪我现在放哪总没错，立刻退下。 一连数日，清静峰众弟子都小心翼翼，尽量避开雷池，生怕触到师尊一碰就疼的那根弦， 都以为过些日子总会有所好转的，谁知道过了半个多月了，沈清秋看似正在逐渐恢复正常 ，结果，有一天临近饭点时，忽然听见沈清秋在竹舍里叫了两声洛冰河的名字。 宁婴婴蹬蹬蹬冲进来，把沈清秋吓了一跳： “ 做什么？突然闯进屋子来，姑娘家这么风风 火火的，像什么样子。 ” 宁婴婴红着眼睛，像只小兔子，道： “ 师尊，你 …… 你想吃什么，我帮你做！ ” 沈清秋干咳一声，道： “ 不必。你出去玩儿吧。 ” 宁婴婴跺脚道： “ 师尊！就算没了阿洛，可您 …… 可您还有我们其他的弟子啊。您这样 …… 失魂落魄的，弟子、弟子们真快要急死了！ ” 失魂落魄这个词能用到自己身上，沈清秋真半辈子都没想过。 其实到金丹这个修为，吃不吃真没啥所谓，他就是嘴馋，忽然想吃点心，加上刚好不小心 忘了洛冰河已经被他踹下无间深渊去了而已，怎么就被盖章成 “ 失魂落魄 ” 了？！ 沈清秋张张嘴，百口莫辩，见宁婴婴急得都快哭了，忙反过来安慰她，信誓旦旦刚才只是 说漏嘴，这才消停。 把人哄出去后，沈清秋长长出了一口气，忽然觉得，这个在书中一直娇娇嗲嗲、只会闯祸 拖后腿的小姑娘居然成长了不少。 要知道，她可是洛冰河的后宫诶，明明她才是最应该哭天抢地的，结果却还知道要来安慰 师父。 这算不算他的教育小有成效？ 总之，不能再这样下去了！ 明明是他把小绵羊男主拉扯大了，怎么现在倒好像男主圈养了他一样。才几天没见就整天 摆着张死了老公的寡妇脸吓唬谁。 不对，我呸！沈清秋心里给了自己一嘴巴。 说谁寡妇脸！谁死了老公！这话也特么是能乱说的，真是越活越回去了，狗嘴吐不出象牙 ，该打！ 不过，大概洛冰河走了，他真是有点寂寞不舍的吧。 尤其是想到，五年之后，重逢之时，曾经的师慈徒孝（ …… ）就要都变成笑里藏刀、杀机 暗藏了。 正阳剑残骸被沈清秋带回去，胡乱在清静峰竹舍后刨了个土坑，竖个牌子，立了个剑冢。 旁人见他对着空碑出神，以为是思念爱徒，不免唏嘘师徒情深，造化弄人。只有他自己才 知道，唏嘘感慨的是剑冢之中，埋葬的那个再也不会回来、和煦如阳的少年。 真正让他风中凌乱泪迎九霄的，是系统沉寂数日后，发送的一条灭绝人性的提示消息。 【恭喜！贵方成功完成关键任务 “ 传奇开启：洛冰河的坠落与再生 ” 。奖励主角爽度 10000. 】 沈清秋还没来得及高兴一把，紧接着： 【但同时由于特殊情况，激活新的数值：洛冰河心碎度。由于心碎度过高，主角爽度清 零。请再接再励！】 …… 清零 …… 清零 …… 清零 …… 两个大字在沈清秋脑海中无限循环 …… 所以心碎度到底是什么鬼东西！ 不是跟你说了不要随便激活奇怪的数据吗？！ 滚蛋吧洛冰河果然是亲儿子，连心碎都能单独划出个数值来！ 当牛做马三十年，一夜回到解放前。反派好忧伤，心塞太平洋。 既然他自己不痛快，那当然要去找别人的不痛快。 于是，沈清秋让明帆跑腿递了个贴，把尚清华请来了竹舍。 尚清华放下雪瓷茶盏，笑道： “ 沈师兄的清静峰真是清幽静雅。连小小茶盏都如此精致。 这份风雅真让清华自愧不如。 ” 清静峰与安定峰以往井水不犯河水，沈清秋高冷，也很少主动邀客，这次居然派徒弟上安 定峰递帖子请人，尚清华难免心中摸不着底儿。伸手不打笑脸人，他先把好话送上去，总 不会错。 沈清秋屏退弟子，关门叹道： “ 师弟这么一说，我又要睹物思情了。这清静舍一草一木， 一盏一碟，皆是我那徒儿亲手布置。 ” “……” 尚清华也跟着叹道： “ 唉，洛师侄少年英才，实在可惜。那魔族令我们折损惨重， 实在可恨，普天同悲，沈师兄节哀。 ” 沈清秋幽幽地道： “ 尚师弟若真觉得可惜，便不会有这桩惨事了。 ” 闻言，尚清华一僵。 片刻过后，他无痕无迹地把笑容圆了过去： “ 沈师兄这话说得是什么意思？莫非是责怪我 安定峰督办不力？若是如此，师弟确实应该在此赔不是。 ” 沈清秋给他续了一杯茶，道： “ 哪里是不力，分明就是用力过头。连鬼头蛛、女怨缠、骨 鹰这些从未主动流入人界的魔族生物都找来了，师兄如何忍心责怪你督办不力？ ” 尚清华霍然站起，脸色青红白黑交错： “ 沈峰主，话可不能说得太过分！ ” 沈清秋把手放到尚清华肩膀上，严肃地问道： “ 尚师弟为何如此激动，我们坐下说话。我 叫你一声，你敢答应吗？ ” 尚清华冷笑着拨开他的手道： “ 有什么不敢的？尚某自问问心无愧，害怕了你强加罪名不 成？ ” 沈清秋： “ 向天打飞机？ ” 刹那间，似有一道九天神雷，直劈到尚清华头上，劈得他口不能言。 半晌，他才颤颤巍巍道： “ 你 …… 你怎么知道我这个 ID ？ ” 沈清秋看了他的反应，仿佛连带着也被雷劈焦了。 他只是想通过观察尚清华听到这个名字时的反应来判断对方是否读过《狂傲仙魔途》。这 看样子 …… 不止是读过啊？！ 三秒之后，沈清秋掐上了。 “ 是你啊？老子追完了你这本书，能不知道你这 ID 吗？要不是漠北君出来那会儿听你不小 心说漏嘴了一句，还真不知道你打哪儿来啊菊苣！ ” 那候时，尚清华见漠北君突然冒出的一刹那，无意脱口而了出一句 “WTF ！ ” 当时沈清秋听的不是很真切，所以没在意，事后却越想越怀疑。 尚清华作为幕后黑手（的后勤），在剧情的不可抗力下，却没放本该戏份多多的黑月蟒犀 ，原本就是个大疑点，而如果把这解释为刻意阻止剧情发展，把洛冰河被打下无间深渊的 悲剧根源切断，就说得通了。 两人相对无言，一个赛一个的外焦里嫩。 半晌，沈清秋道： “ 挖坑不填！伏笔作废！雷点遍地！小学生文笔！写种马文你就好好写 种马，玩什么虐心虐身流？！ ” 尚清华： “…… 我也是受害者，我好歹是作者，不穿男主至少也该穿个系统吧？谁知道插 个插座触个电，系统随机分配角色，就给配了个炮灰。 ” 沈清秋冷笑： “ 总比我强，你卧底身份暴露了直接被漠北君灭口，好歹死得痛快。我被洛 冰河亲自削成什么来着，你还记得不？ ” 尚清华： “ 你才重生了几年啊？一重生过来就是宗师级别的吧？我可是从婴儿时期就穿过 来了。穷苦潦倒的童年、不受重视的外门弟子时期，你有我经历的多吗？ ” 比惨比不出结果，结论是，大家都半斤八两。尚清华感慨道： “ 居然遇到了读者。缘分， 缘分。人生四喜之他乡遇故知啊。你终点文学网书友 ID 是啥？说不定还是老熟人。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 绝世黄瓜。 ” 尚清华思索了一阵，道： “ 有点儿印象。是不是有次有个求阉反派的楼你在里面叫得特别 凶？就是在你，咳咳，原来的沈清秋想要对宁婴婴 ……” “……” 沈清秋： “ 我不相信你只对这一件事有印象。往事休提。 ” 他正色道： “ 废话到此为止。我今天之所以要找你摊开来说，是因为仙盟大会之后，突然 想到了一个法子，也许能够解决你我共同的难题。 ”,"CHAPTER 28: FRIENDS FROM THE SAME HOMETOWN This year’s Immortal Alliance Conference was the one with the most disastrous losses since its inception. The new talent from each sect participating in the conference numbered around a thousand; the Zhao Hua Temple members who’d focused on acting as the pillars of the barrier spell had been luckily spared, while Huan Hua Palace suffered the most damage, losing nearly a hundred people. Cang Qiong Mountain suffered the least; only thirty or so had suffered harm. As for the other assorted sects and clans, the newcomers with low skill and meagre cultivation were mostly concentrated in this group; this was the group that had truly been hit the hardest by casualties. Getting your name on the gold-inscribed tablet should have been a joyous occasion, but looking at it now, many of the people on the gold-inscribed tablet had perished in Jue Di Gorge. Especially the first-ranked name high at the top of the list, a member of Cang Qiong Mountain’s Qing Jing Peak, Shen Qingqiu’s beloved disciple Luo Binghe: deceased and his sword broken, truly heartbreaking news. And this was not even counting the casualties among the cultivators who had entered the scene to give aid after the incident. With this battle, each sect could be said to have suffered major losses. A red ranking chart was delivered to Qing Jing Peak. On the ranking chart, the first place “Luo Binghe” was high at the top, glittering in gold. Ming Fan walked in and reported, “Shizun, ten thousand spirit stones were delivered, what should be done with them?” Ten thousand spirit stones? Shen Qingqiu stared blankly. “Why would they suddenly send so many spirit stones up the mountain?” Ming Fan said carefully, “Shizun, have you forgotten? Shizun, at the Immortal Alliance Conference, you bet five thousand…” Shen Qingqiu remembered. It was the bet he had placed on Luo Binghe. Yue Qingyuan had said that any loss would be on him, while any earnings could be kept for himself. Sure enough, Luo Binghe had tried his hardest, and in the final hour, he had shot past the first- and second-ranked Gongyi Xiao and Liu Mingyan toperch himself at the head of the rankings, earning him double his initial investment. At the time, he had thought that a dollar earned was a dollar earned, might as well get something as consolation, but now he was at a bit of a loss. In the past, he had always given these things to Luo Binghe to handle: whether it should be sorted for storage or used for something else, how to use it; he never had to worry about them himself. But now, Ming Fan was asking him what to do. Shen Qingqiu thought for a while, then said, “Put it away for now.” “…” Ming Fan actually wanted to ask for more details, like “Where should I put it?”, but Shizun’s face really did not look too good, so he was too afraid to keep asking; he thought, it should be fine if I put it where Luo Binghe used to put things, and immediately withdrew. For many days, Qing Jing Peak’s disciples walked on eggshells, doing their best to avoid the landmines, afraid of touching their Shizun’s sore spot. They all thought that after a few days, things would eventually take a turn for the better; but after half a month had passed and Shen Qingqiu seemed to be gradually returning to normal, one day, right before mealtime, they suddenly heard Shen Qingqiu call Luo Binghe’s name a few times from the Bamboo House. With a thud-thud-thud, Ning Yingying burst inside, giving Shen Qingqiu a scare. “What are you doing? Charging in here so suddenly; it’s unsightly for a lady to act so rough and undisciplined.” Ning Yingying’s eyes were red, like that of a little bunny’s; she said, “Shizun, you… whatever you want to eat, I’ll make it for you!” Shen Qingqiu coughed, then said, “No need. Go out and play.” Ning Yingying stamped her foot and said, “Shizun! Even if A-Luo is gone, you… you still have the rest of us disciples. You’re so… beside yourself 121 , us disciples, us disciples are worried to death!” Shen Qingqiu would never have expected someone to use the words ‘beside yourself’ to describe him. Actually, now that he’d reached the Core Formation stage, it didn’t matter whether he ate or not; he’d just gotten a sudden craving and wanted to eat some snacks, and just happened to have forgotten that he’d already kicked Luo Binghe into the Endless Abyss. How did this count as being “beside himself”?! Shen Qingqiu opened his mouth, a hundred words of protest ready to spill forth, but seeing that Ning Yingying was nearly about to cry from anxiousness,he hurriedly switched to comforting her instead; only after he swore solemnly that just now was a slip of the tongue, did she calm down. After coaxing her back outside, Shen Qingqiu let out a long sigh, and suddenly felt that this little miss, who in the original novel had always been pampered and childish, only capable of getting in trouble and being a burden, had actually grown up quite a bit. Remember, she was Luo Binghe’s harem member; she was the one who was supposed to be clawing at the ground, wailing to the heavens, but she’d actually known to come comfort her master. Did his education actually have some effect? Either way, things couldn’t go on like this any longer! Clearly he was the one who’d raised the little sheep of a protagonist; why did it now look like the protagonist had been the one raising him? Who was he scaring putting on the act of a grieving widow, when it’d been only a couple of days since he’d seen him? No, pah! Shen Qingqiu mentally slapped himself. Who are you calling a grieving widow! Whose husband died! That’s not something you should just blather out; you’re really getting worse day by day. A negative mind produces nothing good 122 ; a slap is deserved! But, perhaps because Luo Binghe had left, he really was a bit lonely. Especially when he thought that five years later, when they’d reunite, what had once been a compassionate teacher and filial disciple (…) would become concealed bloodlust, and daggers hidden within smiles. Shen Qingqiu had brought the broken pieces of Zheng Yang back with him; he messily dug a hole behind Qing Jing Peak’s Bamboo House, erected a tablet, and set up a sword mound. When others saw him lost in thought facing that empty tablet, they thought he was reminiscing about a beloved disciple, and could only sigh, what a deep master-and-disciple bond; fate toys with us all. Only he knew that the one he was lamenting was within this sword mound, buried underneath and incapable of returning: that youth as warm as the sun. What truly broke him and caused him to weep at the heavens was that after several days of silence, the System gave him a message truly devoid of all humanity. Congratulations! You have successfully completed the key quest, “The Legend Begins: Luo Binghe’s Fall and Rebirth.” Reward: Protagonist Satisfaction Points +10000. Before Shen Qingqiu even had the chance to be happy, it continued:But also, due to extraordinary circumstances, a new point value has been activated: Luo Binghe’s Degree of Heartbreak. Due to excessively high Degree of Heartbreak, Protagonist Satisfaction Points have been reset to zero. Please continue to advance your efforts! … Reset to zero… Reset to zero… Reset to zero… Those three large words looped endlessly within Shen Qingqiu’s mind. What the hell is this Degree of Heartbreak! Didn’t I tell you not to randomly activate strange point values?! Get out, so Luo Binghe really is your darling son; even his heartbreak gets a point value of its own?! Years of slaving over every command, and he was back to square one in a single night. Being a villain was truly miserable, with enough grievances to fill the Pacific Ocean. Since he was unhappy, naturally he had to go take it out on someone else. So, Shen Qingqiu had Ming Fan deliver a message inviting Shang Qinghua to the Bamboo House. Shang Qinghua put down the porcelain tea bowl and smiled, “Shen- shixiong’s Qing Jing Peak is truly elegant and secluded. Even something as small as a tea bowl is so exquisite. Such sophistication truly makes Qinghua feel ashamed.” Qing Jing Peak and An Ding Peak had always minded their own business; Shen Qingqiu was reserved and aloof, and very rarely took the initiative to invite guests, but this time he had actually sent a disciple to An Ding Peak with an invitation; Shang Qinghua was unable to figure out what he wanted. No one slaps smiling faces, so he started out with compliments; at least that couldn’t be a misstep. Shen Qingqiu dismissed the disciples, closed the door, and sighed, “Shidi, with these words of yours, everything I see has begun to bring up old memories again. Every plank, every dish in this Qing Jing Bamboo House was personally arranged by that disciple of mine.” “…” Shang Qinghua sighed along with him, “Ah, Luo-shizhi was a heroic youth, such a pity. Those demons brought such disaster upon us; they are truly hateful; the whole world mourns with us. Shen-shixiong, my condolences.” Shen Qingqiu said faintly, “If Shang-shidi truly felt it was a pity, this tragedy would not have occurred.” Hearing this, Shang Qinghua stiffened. After a moment, he seamlessly slid his smile back onto his face. “Whatdoes Shen-shixiong mean by this? Is he rebuking our An Ding Peak for inadequate administration? If so, Shidi should truly apologize.” Shen Qingqiu refilled his teacup and continued, “How was it inadequate; you clearly overexerted yourself. You even found demonic creatures like the Ghost-head Spiders, Nu Yuan Chan, and Bone Eagles that never enter the human realm of their own volition; how could Shixiong rebuke you for inadequate administration?” Shang Qinghua shot to his feet, his face rapidly changing colors. “Peak Lord Shen, don’t make such outrageous accusations!” Shen Qingqiu put his hand on Shang Qinghua’s shoulder and asked solemnly, “Why is Shang-shidi getting so excited; let’s sit down and talk. Let me call you something; do you agree?” With a sneer, Shang Qinghua brushed away his hand and said, “Why wouldn’t I? I have a clear conscience; why would I fear a false accusation?” Shen Qingqiu: “Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky?” In that instant, it was like a bolt of lightning from the heavens had struck Shang Qinghua in the head, rendering him unable to speak. After a long time, he managed to stammer out, “You… how do you know this ID of mine?” Seeing his reaction, it was like Shen Qingqiu had also been burnt to a crisp by this bolt of lightning. He’d only wanted to observe Shang Qinghua’s reaction to this name to determine if he had also read Proud Immortal Demon Way. But looking at this… he wasn’t just a reader?! After three long seconds, Shen Qingqiu jumped on him. “It’s you? After reading your entire fucking novel, could I not know your ID? If you hadn’t let something slip when Mobei-Jun appeared, I really would never have known where you emerged from, ‘Great Master!’” The moment Shang Qinghua had seen Mobei-Jun suddenly appear, he had accidentally let out a “WTF!” At the time, Shen Qingqiu had not heard very clearly, so he had not paid it any mind, but afterwards, he grew more and more suspicious the more he thought about it. As the one who’d masterminded the event (or the logistics of it), he was under the irresistible pressure of the plot, yet he had not released the Black Moon Python-Rhino that should have starred in numerous scenes. This was suspicious enough, but if you explained it as something done intentionally tohinder the development of the plot, to severe the tragedy of Luo Binghe being thrown into the Endless Abyss at its roots, it made sense. The two stared at each other, speechless, competing for most stunned. After a long time, Shen Qingqiu said, “Digging holes and not filling them! Foreshadowing gone to waste! Landmines all over the place! Elementary- schooler writing style! If you’re going to write a stallion novel, then write a proper stallion novel, don’t fool around writing torture and suffering?!” Shang Qinghua: “… I’m also a victim here; no matter what, I’m still the author: even if I don’t transmigrate into the protagonist, I should at least transmigrate into a System, right? But all of a sudden, I try to plug in a cord and I get electrocuted, the System assigns me a character at random, and I end up a cannon fodder.” Shen Qingqiu sneered. “Still better than me: after you’re exposed as a spy, Mobei-Jun kills you outright to silence you, at least it’s a straightforward death. I’ll get carved up by Luo Binghe himself, don’t you remember?” Shang Qinghua: “You only transmigrated here how many years ago? Right upon rebirth, you were already at the rank of a great master, right? I transmigrated here as an infant. My childhood where I was destitute and miserable, my years as a disrespected outer disciple, have you gone through more than I have?” This competition had no winner, because in the end, it was six of one, half a dozen of the other. Shang Qinghua sighed and said, “I actually met a reader. Must be fate, must be fate. One of the four joys of life is meeting an old friend in a foreign place. What was your Zhongdian ID? Maybe we were old acquaintances.” Shen Qingqiu said, “Peerless Cucumber.” Shang Qinghua thought for a while, then said, “There’s some impression. Weren’t you especially vicious in one of those threads that was calling to castrate the villain? It was when you, ahem, when the original Shen Qingqiu wanted to do… to Ning Yingying…” “…” Shen Qingqiu: “I refuse to believe you only remember this one thing. Don’t bring up the past.” He said resolutely, “Enough with the blather. I wanted to have a full discussion with you today, because after the Immortal Alliance Conference, I suddenly thought of an idea; perhaps it can solve both of our problems.”"
尚清华一愣： “ 当真？ ” 沈清秋： “ 在这种事上开玩笑，很好笑？此法包治根本，只要不走漏风声，永绝后患。就 靠你。你，还记得自己设定过一种千年出世一次的植物吗？ ” “……” 尚清华无语： “ 你这个范围也太广了。千年出世一次被冰哥吃了用了的植物我写过 的没有一百也有八十。 ” 你自己也知道！ 沈清秋叹了口气，在他耳边说了五个字。 尚清华闻言悚然，片刻之后，意味深长地看了沈清秋一眼。 沈清秋： “ 你看我干什么？ ” “ 没什么。 ” 尚清华道： “ 我很早就觉得黄瓜兄你是我的忠实读者，只是不喜欢用普通方式 表达。我用完就丢的设定，你居然能从旮旯里挖出来。我在感动。 ” “……” 沈清秋道： “ 你明天就跟我下山去它出世之地找一趟吧。 ” 尚清华道： “ 明天？这 …… 是不是有点仓促？ ” 他期期艾艾道： “ 其实我 …… 想不起来它的具体位置和描述了。全文将近两千万字，提到 它的只有一个自然段。你让我慢慢想，想到了再告诉你。 ” 沈清秋语重心长： “ 那等到洛冰河杀回来，漠北君被他收服，到时候一个杀我，一个杀你 ，你再想起来也不迟。 ” 尚清华： “…… 好。明天我一定想起来！ ” 反正安定峰上，那些诸如新弟子入门怎么给他们分配房间和定制校服这种鸡毛蒜皮的事也 不一定非要峰主才能做。 尚清华回去，苦苦思索一晚，绞尽脑汁，脑袋里翻江倒海地倒腾，终于在黎明前灵光一闪 ，在地图上勾了个地方出来。 沈清秋见了地图，一拍桌子，拎着他就下山出发了。一段路吃喝，一段路玩乐；一段路御 剑，一段路行车，本来应该是很愉快的。 唯一有点小小不愉快的是，尚清华坐在驾车位上，长吁短叹。 他质问： “ 为什么吃喝住宿，出钱的都是我？为什么坐马车，赶车的还是我？ ” 沈清秋在车厢内道： “ 也不害臊。经费是公费，掌门师兄给的，你只是把钱从腰包里掏出 来而已。 ” 想到临行前，岳清源叮嘱他的话，尚清华心酸至极。 什么叫 “ 尚师弟，游历期间，清秋就拜托你了。他有毒在身，还望你好好看顾。 ” 作为作者，原先拼命把尚清华往极品贱人方向塑造的向天打飞机菊苣，终于体会到了角色 的痛。 搞后勤真的没前途，人人把他当保姆！原装尚清华不择手段想要上位，有什么不能理解 的？太理解了！ 尚清华道： “ 你有手有脚，为什么不自己 …… 卧槽卧槽！ ” 沈清秋感觉车厢猛地往前一倾，似乎是尚清华陡然勒马，帘子一掀，警觉道： “ 怎么回 事？ ” 马车正穿过一片密密树林。 四周古木冲天，落叶纷繁，阳光和都被层层枝叶遮挡，地上连点点光斑都难以见到。 沈清秋见无异状，也没放松警惕，道： “ 你鬼叫什么。 ” 尚清华惊魂未定： “ 我刚才看见一个女的在地上像条蛇一样哧溜爬过去了！马车不停差点 直接碾过去！ ” 听起来有点诡异。沈清秋道： “ 那确实值得鬼叫。 ” 林间静谧，暂时并没见到异状。沈清秋不敢掉以轻心，没坐进车厢，而是和尚清华一起坐 在了赶车位上，一手捏起剑诀，暗暗观察，另一手从零食袋里抓了一把瓜子，塞给尚清华 ：“ 乖，进去嗑着玩儿。 ” 尚清华拿来使唤使唤打打杂倒还可以，拿来打怪却是没啥大用。他也知道自己水平怎么样 ，老老实实接过瓜子嗑了起来。马车走一步，他就嗑一颗。于是，在一炷香之后，他们终 于…… 发现了一个很严重的问题。 两人无语地看着地上那条熟悉的瓜子壳路。 尚清华道： “ 嗯，不用怀疑，苍穹山派千草峰出产的龙骨香瓜子，色泽熟红，内壳金黄， 肯定是我刚才嗑的那一条。 ” 沈清秋： “ 知道兜售瓜子是你们安定峰的副业。够了。 ” 那么，问题来了。他们怎么又转回了原来的地方？ 两人面面相觑。 鬼打墙，一个巨俗巨老的经典桥段。 尚清华想了个土方子： “ 要不咱用童子尿淋一淋马眼睛试试？ ” 沈清秋道： “…… 马也是有尊严的，为什么要用排泄物淋它眼睛。而且荒山野岭的，你叫 我上哪儿找童子尿去？ ” 此话一出，他发现尚清华正真诚地注视着他。 沈清秋： “ 你看我干什么？我本人 …… 暂且不提。沈清秋原角色，你自己写的，外表高洁 内心荒淫，整天 □□ 焚身，少年偷情、青年找鸡。你觉得我现在还是童子？不要指你自己 ，尚清华这个角色设定也差不多。 ” 沈清秋皱眉凝神细思，忽然一拍大腿。他转身钻进车厢，突然又听马车外尚清华一声鬼哭 狼嚎。沈清秋拿了要找的东西钻出来喝道： “ 什么东西？！ ” 尚清华吓得说话连标点符号都不带了： “ 你一进去我觉得有个毛茸茸的东西在蹭我脖子抬 头一看是一团头发头发后面还有张大白脸没看清啊卧槽！ ” 沈清秋抬头，自然看不到任何东西。坐定了，一展手中图纸，挑眉道： “ 不管这东西是什 么，它还挺精。 ” “ 何以见得？ ” “ 知道柿子挑软的捏，人找怂的吓。 ” 又拍拍他肩： “ 再恐怖的东西也是你自己写的，怕什 么！ ” 尚清华道： “ 我不记得我写过 …… 瓜兄，你在看地图？你看清楚，这是大陆地图，整个大 陆都在上面，白露林就算标出来也只有一个点那么大。 ” 沈清秋指地图下方： “ 你自己看，这个地方。 ” 苍穹山、昭华寺雄踞东方，天一观安居中部，而南方，则是幻花宫的地盘。 白露森林那一点，刚好就点在幻花宫淡墨勾勒而成的边界上。 尚清华恍然大悟： “ 幻花宫把白露森林也划进自己势力范围了？所以我们现在不是进了鬼 打墙，而是进了他们的护宫阵法？ ” 各大门派为防止闲杂人等捣乱都设有自己的阵法。比如苍穹山的登天梯，如果是不知门路 的凡夫俗子，就会在一万三千级石阶上爬到半死，永远登不到顶，只能等护山弟子把他们 送下去。卡在这里，没有人指引，恐怕只能一直原地转圈了。 沈清秋敲门： “ 系统？在不？ ” 顿了顿，没有回复，他又敲： “ 说好的 24 小时在线服务？不出来给差评。 ” 系统：【您好，系统已进入休眠模式，现在是智能代理，如需服务请自助。】 休眠。沈清秋为之绝倒。 说起来，系统这几天的确都没给他计算 B 格和各种新开的奇葩指数。 智能代理：【系统总能源 “ 洛冰河 ” 已切断联系，后台维护更新中，重新连线时系统将被激 活，祝您自助服务期间一切愉快。谢谢。】 现在已经这么蛋疼了你更新版本后会不会直接让我蛋碎啊  不对重点是原来洛冰河还是 总能源我擦！ 沈清秋还要再追问，发现这个代理反反复复给出的都是这两句。 什么鬼智能代理，这不就跟扣扣的自动回复一个样吗？你也好意思在前面加上 “ 智能 ” 两个 字！ 沈清秋拍尚清华： “ 敲你家系统，看看还连着线不？ ” 尚清华眨眨眼，片刻之后： “ 说在维护中。 ” 原来洛冰河还不只是一个系统的总能源，他一掉线全部系统都跟着瘫痪了！ 这事说严重，其实也没那么严重，无非洛冰河无间深渊练级期间不能刷 B 格。想想也挺好 ，不能刷自然也不能减，相当于百无禁忌！ 沈清秋正宽慰自己，忽然觉察一旁灌木丛唆唆异动，当即打个响指，喝道： “ 出来！ ” 腰间修雅澄然出鞘，顺着沈清秋手中剑诀操纵号令，翻飞刺砍。奈何那个东西像条游鱼一 般，躲在灌木丛里泥鳅一样滑溜的厉害，百刺不中。 突然，沈清秋眼前一道刺眼的厉光闪过。那东西尖锐地嘶叫一声，倏地猛往后蹿了数丈。 灌木丛已经被砍得七零八落，藏不住东西，那玩意儿早跑了，再无动静。 他刚才没发大招啊？貌似只是反射了一瞬间的阳光。 尚清华凑过头来： “ 它怕光？我靠，真是女鬼啊！我没写过，绝对没写过！ ” 两人正想讨论一下，忽然传来一阵极细微的足音。 这人身法很好，换个修为稍浅的，便绝对不会觉察有人靠近。丛丛林木间，转出一个白衣 少年。 那少年原本剑已出鞘，满脸警惕，而看清来者之后，改为诧异，忙收剑施礼。 “ 晚辈觉察结界周围有异样波动，特此赶来，不知沈仙师，尚仙师在此，有失远迎。 ” 沈清秋看他长得挺帅，就是有点眼生，客气道： “ 少侠是？ ” 那少年脚底一滑。 尚清华在他耳边低声道： “ 你太不给人家面子了。这是公仪萧。 ” 公仪萧稍微有点郁闷。 虽然他被被洛冰河从金榜榜首上踹下了，可好歹也是第二名，成绩斐然，加上此前夺冠呼 声最高，也常随老宫主拜访各派高层，沈清秋没认出他，真真出乎他意料。 沈清秋赞道： “ 果然英雄出少年。 ” 公仪萧道： “ 不敢当。两位峰主来到幻花宫地界，为何此前不曾告知？怠慢前辈，实在余 心难安。 ” 这还真把白露林当成他们家地盘了。作为领工资得意弟子，必然要琢磨苍穹山派一下子来 了两位峰主，鬼鬼祟祟在他们势力范围边界究竟是何居心。 沈清秋道： “ 并无拜访幻花宫的意图，只是要在白露林处理一桩小事而已。 ” 沈清秋既已告知是前来办事，又不明说什么事，摆明不愿多谈。照说公仪萧也不应随意发 问。毕竟晚辈质问前辈的行踪目的，那可不太像话。可犹豫片刻，公仪萧仍道： “ 虽不知 两位前辈要办的是什么事，晚辈不才，斗胆请求一同前往相助。 ” 沈清秋面带微笑，嘴唇几乎没动，对队友嘀咕道： “ 现在拒绝他让他走了，待会儿来找咱 们的可就不止一个人了。不如捎上他，好歹是个能打的。 ” 不能打的尚清华也嘀咕道： “ 万一他不让咱们拿走日月露华芝怎么办。长在我家院子里， 当然是我家的东西。长在我家篱笆墙沿上的，那也是我家的东西。别说我没告诉你幻花宫 的逻辑。 ” 沈清秋： “ 你傻么你。到时候拿了就走，他还能强抢不成。回去跟他老师打小报告也是之 后的事了，咱早拍屁股走人，等他们来捉？ ” 尚清华： “ 两派交恶怎么办？ ” “ 保命和外交关系，你选一个。 ” 尚清华毫不犹豫： “ 带上他走吧！ ” 沈清秋抬头，果断对公仪萧道： “ 走吧！ ” 于是，驾车的苦力交给了晚辈。 他边操控缰绳边好奇道： “ 沈前辈，晚辈有一事不解。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 请讲。 ” 公仪萧道： “ 依前辈的修为，破入本派阵法，不需片刻，而且能做到神不知鬼不觉，为何 会造成如此之大的灵力波动？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 那阵波动并非破除阵法时产生的，而是在应对一只奇异魔物时产生的。 ” “ 奇异魔物？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 其实也难以判断是不是魔物，但形貌邪异，不像正常的人界生物。 ” 公仪萧道： “ 白露林附近，方圆十里就有人烟分布，倒是从未听说受过魔物侵扰。连猛虎 野兽也是不曾有的。 ” 沈清秋沉吟道： “ 那究竟会是什么东西？散发披面，骨骼奇软，脸孔浮肿犹如饿殍浮尸。 ” 公仪萧道： “ 无论是什么，不再出现是最好，如果出现了，不必劳烦两位前辈动手，交由 晚辈便好。 ” 话中敬意倒是不假。他虽然对这位修雅剑前辈了解有限，从前也只是远远见过一两面，但 上次仙盟大会，沈清秋亲传弟子越过他夺得榜首，他本人也救助了不少幻花宫弟子，是以 不乏敬重。 沈清秋见他举止得体，该有的谦顺半点不少，加之相貌和洛冰河是一个风格的，属于那种 温柔多情，眉目含笑的俊美，很难不联想起未黑化的乖徒儿洛冰河，即，很难不心生好 感。,"CHAPTER 29: BAI LU FOREST Shang Qinghua froze. “For real?” Shen Qingqiu: “You think joking about something like this is funny? This method is guaranteed to fix everything; as long as it’s kept absolutely secret, we’ll avoid all trouble. It all depends on you. You, do you still remember creating a plant that only appears every thousand years?” “…” Shang Qinghua was speechless. “Your description is way too broad. The number of plants Bing-ge’s eaten that appear once every thousand years, are at least eighty, if not one hundred.” So you know too! Shen Qingqiu gave a sigh, then spoke four words into his ear. Shang Qinghua listened, shocked, then after a moment, gave Shen Qingqiu a deeply meaningful glance. Shen Qingqiu: “What are you looking at?” “Nothing.” Shang Qinghua said, “I’ve already long thought that Cucumber-bro is a faithful reader, just one who doesn’t like expressing sentiments normally. To think you were able to dig up an obscure, throwaway setup that I used only once; I’m very moved.” “…” Shen Qingqiu said, “Tomorrow, leave the mountain with me; we’ll go search its place of origin.” Shang Qinghua said, “Tomorrow? This… isn’t this a little too sudden?” He stammered, “Truthfully I… I can’t remember its exact location and description. The entire work was twenty million words long, and it was only mentioned once in a section about nature. Let me think for a while; I’ll tell you once I remember.” With utmost sincerity, Shen Qingqiu said, “Then take your time remembering until Luo Binghe murders his way back, with Mo Beijun under his command; at that time, one will kill me, and the other will kill you; it won’t be too late then, either.” Shang Qinghua: “…Alright. I’ll definitely remember by tomorrow!” After all, on An Ding Peak, trivial matters like assigning rooms and uniforms to newly-accepted disciples, didn’t absolutely require the peak lord to do them. Shang Qinghua went back, and thought long and hard the entire night, racking his brains, shifting and overturning the contents of his mind; finally before daybreak an epiphany struck, and he circled a location on a map.Upon seeing the map, Shen Qingqiu slapped the table, then grabbed him and set off down the mountain. They spent part of the journey eating, part of it playing, traveled partly by sword and partly by carriage; originally it should have been quite pleasant. The only part that was just a tiny bit unpleasant, was how Shang Qinghua sat in the coachman’s seat, moaning and groaning nonstop. He asked, “Why am I the one paying for all the food and lodgings? Why, when we’re taking a carriage, am I the one driving?” Inside the carriage, Shen Qingqiu said, “Don’t you feel any shame. The funds are public funds, provided by Zhangmen-shixiong; all you’re doing is taking them from the waist pouch.” Thinking about the words Yue Qingyuan had urged him with upon leaving, Shang Qinghua’s heart felt extremely sour. What was “Shang-shidi, for the journey’s duration, Qingqiu will be in your care. He’s poisoned, so please watch over him.” As the author “Great Master” Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky, who’d put his all into portraying Shang Qinghua as scum, he finally understood this character’s suffering. Logistics really had no prospects; everyone treated him like a nanny! What wasn’t understandable about the original Shang Qinghua’s desire to climb up by any means? It was all too understandable! Shang Qinghua said, “You have hands and feet, why don’t you yourself… fuck, fuck!” Shen Qingqiu felt the carriage’s suddenly pitch forward, like Shang Qinghua had abruptly reined the horse in; he raised the curtains, alert, and said, “What’s wrong?” The carriage was currently passing through a stretch of dense forest. All around them, ancient trees soared into the sky, fallen leaves were scattered everywhere, the sunlight completely blocked by layers upon layers of branches; on the ground, even sunspots were difficult to find. Seeing that there was nothing strange, Shen Qingqiu relaxed his guard, and said, “What were you screaming for.” Shang Qinghua was still panicked. “Just now I saw a woman on the ground, slithering by like a snake! If I didn’t stop the carriage I would’ve run her right over! Hearing this, this did seem rather eerie. Shen Qingqiu said, “That is indeed worth screaming over.”The forest was still and quiet; as of right now nothing seemed off. Shen Qingqiu didn’t dare lower his guard; instead of sitting back inside the carriage, he sat with Shang Qinghua in the driver’s seat, forming a sword sign with one hand and observing in silence, while his other hand pulled out a handful of melon seeds from the snacks bag, and shoved it at Shang Qinghua. “Be good, go inside, eat and play.” Shang Qinghua could be ordered about and used for odd jobs, but when it came to fighting monsters, he was pretty useless. He himself knew his own capabilities, and obediently took the melon seeds and started eating. With every step the horse took, he ate a seed. Therefore, after an incense time, they finally… realized a very serious problem. The two of them wordlessly looked at the ground, at a familiar trail of melon seed hulls. Shang Qinghua said, “Mn, no doubts about it; Cang Qiong Mountain Sect’s Qian Cao Peak’s Dragon-Bone Cantaloupe seeds, are red in color with golden insides; this is definitely the trail of seed hulls I left.” Shen Qingqiu: “I know that peddling melon seeds is one of your An Ding Peak’s side jobs. Enough.” So, there was their problem. How had they returned to their original location? The two of them stared at each other. They were going around in circles, a very tired and classical scenario. Shang Qinghua thought of an old folk method. “How about we try sprinkling a male virgin’s urine into the horse’s eyes?” Shen Qingqiu said, “…Horses have their dignity too; why sprinkle excrement in its eyes. And where am I supposed to find a male virgin’s urine, within this mountain wilderness?” Once these words left his mouth, he realized that Shang Qinghua was gazing intently at him. Shen Qingqiu: “Why are you looking at me? As for my actual self… let’s not talk about that for now. You wrote Shen Qingqiu’s original character yourself; he’s unsullied without, degenerate within, always burning with lust; he had an affair in his youth, and sought prostitutes as an adult. You think I’m still a virgin? And don’t point at yourself, Shang Qinghua’s character was about the same.” Shen Qingqiu frowned and thought carefully, then suddenly slapped his thigh. He turned and entered the carriage, but then abruptly heard ShangQinghua howl again from outside. Shen Qingqiu grabbed the thing he was looking for and scurried out, yelling, “What is it?!” Shang Qinghua was so terrified his words no longer had any punctuation marks. “When you went in I felt something hairy brush my neck and when I raised my head I saw it was a mass of hair and underneath it was a huge white face I couldn’t see clearly fuck me!” Shen Qingqiu lifted his head, and of course couldn’t see anything. He sat down properly and opened the map within his hands, raised an eyebrow and said, “No matter what it is, it’s quite clever.” “Why so?” “It knows to pick on the weak 123 , and chose the easier one to scare.” He patted his shoulder again. “No matter how terrifying the creature, you wrote it yourself; why are you scared!” Shang Qinghua said, “I don’t remember writing… Cucumber-bro, you’re looking at the map? Take a good look, this is a map of the mainland; the entire mainland is on it, Bai Lu Forest may be marked but it’s only the size of a dot.” Shen Qingqiu pointed at the lower portion of the map. “Look at this place yourself.” Cang Qiong Mountain, Zhao Hua Temple were in the east, Tian Yi Monastery was in the center, and in the south, was Huan Hua Palace’s territory. Bai Lu Forest’s mark, just happened to be on its border, outlined with diluted ink. Shang Qinghua suddenly understood. “Huan Hua Palace allotted Bai Lu Forest into its sphere of influence? So right now we aren’t walking in circles, but have instead entered their palace’s protective array? To prevent randoms from stirring up trouble, all the large sects had set up their own spells. Take for example, Cang Qiong Mountain’s Heaven-Ascending Stairs; common people who didn’t know the path would be stuck climbing thirteen thousand steps until they were near death, unable to ever reach the peak, and could only wait for the disciples defending the mountains to take them down. Trapped here and without anyone’s guidance, they could only keep circling in place. Shen Qingqiu knocked. “System? You there?” After a while with no response, he knocked again. “Didn’t you promise 24-hour online service? If you don’t come out I’ll leave a negative review.” The System: Hello, the System has entered Hibernation Mode; currently there is an AI substitute; if you require service, please help yourself.Hibernation. Shen Qingqiu split his sides laughing. Now that it was mentioned, these past few days, the System hadn’t calculated him any B-points or various other bizarre, newly-activated point values. The AI substitute: The System was disconnected from its central power source, “Luo Binghe,” and is currently undergoing maintenance and updates in the background; the System will activate once it’s reconnected; we wish you a pleasant experience using the self-service. Thank you. Your current version is already frustrating enough won’t your new version just straight up kill 124 me in the futureno wait the main point is, Luo Binghe was actually your central power source, the fuck! Shen Qingqiu still wanted to keep asking, but realized that the substitute was repeatedly giving the same two lines. What fucking AI substitute, isn’t this basically like QQ’s 125 automated response? And you still have the nerve to write “AI” in front of it! Shen Qingqiu patted Shang Qinghua. “Knock on your System; check if it’s still connected?” Shang Qinghua blinked, and after a moment said, “It says it’s undergoing maintenance.” So not only was Luo Binghe a single System’s central power source, once he was disconnected all the Systems went down! One could say this matter was serious, but in truth it wasn’t that serious; it only meant that while Luo Binghe was in the Abyss he couldn’t acquire B- points. After thinking about it this was good too; if he couldn’t acquire them he couldn’t lose them; which meant that all restrictions were off! Shen Qingqiu was just consoling himself, when he suddenly sensed the shrubbery by the side rustling and moving; he yelled, “Come out!” At his waist, Xiu Ya left its sheath, controlled by the orders from Shen Qingqiu’s sword signs, flipping, stabbing, and slashing. And that creature hidden in the shrubbery seemed to swim like fish, more slippery than a loach, evading all the stabs. Suddenly, a blinding ray of light flashed before Shen Qingqiu’s eyes. That creature gave a shrill whine, then leapt backwards several tens of feet. The shrubbery had already been slashed into shambles, no longer capable of hiding anything, and that thing had long escaped; there were no further movements. He hadn’t used any big techniques just now? Seemed like he’d justmomentarily reflected a ray of sunlight. Shang Qinghua brought his head in close. “It’s afraid of light? Damn, it really is a female ghost! I didn’t write about one, absolutely didn’t write about one!” The two of them were just about to discuss, when there suddenly came the subtle sound of footsteps. This person’s movements were excellent; if they were of shallow cultivation, they definitely wouldn’t have noticed someone approaching. From the depths of the woods, emerged a youth dressed in white. That youth originally had his sword unsheathed, his face on alert, but after seeing the visitors, his expression became astonished, and he quickly sheathed his sword and greeted them. “This junior sensed some unusual fluctuations around the barrier, and hereby hurried over, not knowing Immortals Shen and Shang were here; please excuse us for not coming over to receive you.” Shen Qingqiu saw that he was quite handsome, but looked unfamiliar, and politely said, “This young hero is?” That youth almost fell over. Shang Qinghua whispered into his ear, “There’s a limit to how little face you can leave others. That’s Gongyi Xiao.” Gongyi Xiao felt a little depressed. Though Luo Binghe had kicked him off the golden tablet’s number one position, no matter what, he was still number two; he possessed remarkable achievements, was also once the favorite for first place, and had greeted each sect’s high-ranking members along with the Old Palace Master, so Shen Qingqiu not recognizing him was completely beyond his expectations. Shen Qingqiu praised, “As expected, heroes start young.” Gongyi Xiao said, “I don’t dare. For Two Peak Lords to enter Huan Hua Palace’s boundaries, why didn’t you inform us beforehand? We’ve neglected our seniors; our hearts are burdened.” This was truly treating Bai Lu Forest as their sect’s territory. As a favored disciple on their payroll, he absolutely had to ponder what intentions two peak lords from Cang Qiong Mountain Sect had come with, to skulk around their sphere of influence’s border. Shen Qingqiu said, “We have no intention of visiting Huan Hua Palace, and are only dealing with a small matter within Bai Lu Forest.” Shen Qingqiu was already informing him that he came for business, yetdidn’t say what for, clearly demonstrating that he wasn’t willing to discuss. In general, Gongyi Xiao also couldn’t ask questions at will. After all, a junior interrogating his seniors about their purpose for being here, was far too improper. After wavering for a moment, Gongyi Xiao said, “Though I don’t know what matter the two seniors are dealing with, this junior is unskilled; may I be bold enough to request to come along for assistance.” Shen Qingqiu’s face held a smile, his lips barely moving, as he muttered to his teammate, “If we refuse him now and let him leave, it won’t be just one person coming to look for us later. It’s better if we bring him along; anyhow he can fight.” Shang Qinghua, who couldn’t fight, also muttered, “In the event he won’t let us walk away with the Sun-Moon Dew Mushroom, what will we do. If it grows in my garden, of course it belongs to me. If it grows along my fence, it also belongs to me. Don’t say that I didn’t tell you about Huan Hua Palace’s logic.” Shen Qingqiu: “Are you an idiot. At that time we take it and leave; he can’t forcibly snatch it from us. If he goes back and tattles to his teacher, that’s also something for the future; we’ll be long gone by then; like we’ll wait for them to catch us?” Shang Qinghua: “What if the two sects turn hostile?” “Your life or diplomatic relations, choose one.” Shang Qinghua didn’t hesitate in the slightest. “Take him along!” Shen Qingqiu raised his head, and decisively said to Gongyi Xiao, “Let’s go!” And so, the hard work of driving was handed to the junior. While maneuvering the reins he said curiously, “Senior Shen, this junior has something I don’t understand.” Shen Qingqiu said, “Please say.” Gongyi Xiao said, “With Senior’s cultivation, breaking our sect’s protective array would only need a moment, and you could do it without anyone knowing better; why did you create such a huge spiritual fluctuation?” Shen Qingqiu said, “That fluctuation wasn’t created from breaking the spell, but from fighting a mysterious demonic creature.” “A mysterious demonic creature?” Shen Qingqiu said, “In truth it was hard to tell if it was demonic, but it had an evil appearance, unlike normal creatures from the Human Realm.” Gongyi Xiao said, “There are human settlements scattered within a fivekilometer radius from Bai Lu Forest, but we’ve never heard word of a demonic invasion. Even fierce beasts aren’t common.” Shen Qingqiu muttered to himself, “Then exactly what was that? Loose hair draped all over its face, an oddly flexible skeleton, and a bloated face like that of a starved, drowned corpse.” Gongyi Xiao said, “No matter what it is; it’s best if it doesn’t appear; if it does, the two seniors need not trouble themselves; it’s fine to leave it to this junior.” The respect within those words wasn’t faked. Though his understanding of this senior with the Xiu Ya sword was limited, and they’d only met once or twice from afar, but during the last Immortal Alliance Conference, Shen Qingqiu’s personal disciple had passed him to rank at the top; the person himself had also saved quite a few of Huan Hua Palace’s disciples, and therefore there was no lack of respect. Shen Qingqiu saw how proper his bearing was, not lacking in the slightest bit of appropriate humility; plus his appearance was of the same type as Luo Binghe’s: gentle and emotional, his beauty in how his eyes smiled; it was very difficult to not think of Luo Binghe the unblackened, lovable disciple, and also, very difficult to not form a favorable impression."
有了公仪萧指引，三人很快破出幻花宫护宫阵法，找准了方位。 原作对日月露华芝具体生长地点的描述并不多，只是略略提及 “ 那是一处被森浓绿意覆盖 的岩窟 ” 。为了想起这么点内容，尚清华真是豁出老了命。毕竟这个东西不是给洛冰河用 的，而是安排给洛冰河某个对头用的。 而正因如此，沈清秋才敢行动。如果是关系到主线剧情，或是要给洛冰河练级用的奇花仙 草，他才没那个胆去抢。跟男主抢资源下场可不是偷鸡不成蚀把米那么甜。既然同为反派 ，随便抢应该没关系！ 好在白露森林虽大，岩窟也就那么一个，省事不少。 沈清秋打个响指，指尖跃起一簇明黄的火焰。再一弹，火焰晃悠悠甩着尾巴，往漆黑潮湿 的岩窟深处游去，在前方开路。 刚开始的岩道还能容三人并行，越到后来，越是狭窄，要侧着身子才能通过。且九曲八弯 ，绕得仿佛巨兽盘肠。 光线黯淡，连沈清秋化出来那团火焰也忽明忽暗，他多弹了几团出来，几枚火球相互追逐 着。公仪萧断后，尚清华本想在岩窟外面等，被沈清秋提了进来。不知道他害怕还是怎么 的，时不时摸一摸沈清秋的胳膊，摸得他一胳膊鸡皮疙瘩。 最后，沈清秋终于忍不住了，碍着还有外人在，低声道： “ 能别掐我吗？ ” 没有回应。不过没摸了。沈清秋继续往前摸索，谁知道尚清华又踢了他小腿一脚。 沈清秋忍不住脱口而出： “ 靠！ ” 尚清华的声音远远从后面传来： “ 沈  师  兄！你  说  什  么？ ” 他的声音在弯弯曲曲的岩道中回荡，似乎被拉长了不少。原来不知不觉间，沈清秋越走越 快，尚清华又磨磨蹭蹭，连带堵得最后的公仪萧也走不快，另外两人已被他甩开好一段 路。 不是尚清华，那刚才一直摸他的人是谁？ 或者说，摸他的东西，是什么？ 沈清秋猝然止步。 他面无表情地拍了拍手臂，企图拍掉上面的鸡皮疙瘩。 几团火焰还悬在空中，幽幽燃烧。 敌暗，我明。 沈清秋左手一翻，袖口无声无息翻出几枚符咒，右手缓缓拔出修雅。剑光逐渐升明，无论 前方还是后方，都是黑黝黝的岩石，散发着湿漉漉的腥味。 他忽然想起来，刚才小腿上中了的那一下，看感觉似乎不是用脚踢的。反而更像是 …… 头 撞的！ 沈清秋猛一低头，视线恰恰和地面上一张惨白浮肿的脸孔撞了个正着。 沈清秋左手把符咒朝那张脸打了上去，刹那间狭窄的岩道里电光火光炸成一团。他本想拔 剑，没料到空间过于狭窄，还没拔到一半，右臂磕到岩壁上，剑柄也撞了岩石，发出铛的 一声。 那东西柔软无骨，像条巨蛇一样在地上滑行，闪避极快，这么近的距离符咒居然也没打中 ，反而比他行动更为灵活。沈清秋只在拔剑上迟了一步，它便嗖嗖掉转头爬走。后头正是 尚清华和公仪萧跟来的方向。他大喝道： “ 留神！有东西过去了！ ” 尚清华一听，立刻回头道： “ 少侠，快！我们换位！ ” 做后勤工作的，怎么能够站在冲锋陷 阵的最前沿！ 公仪萧依言而行，奈何岩道窄的令人发指，容一人行走后只余一拳之宽，他根本过不去。 尚清华又听沈清秋在那边吼： “ 地上！看地上！它在地上爬！ ” 再一转头，就看见一条蛇人 哧溜哧溜滑了过来。 尚清华当机立断，立刻躺倒！ 公仪萧也从未见过这么诡异的怪物，呆了一下，忽然见尚前辈也趴到了，脸抽了抽，反应 过来，说声： “ 得罪！ ” 一跃而过 …… 无论如何难看，后勤和前锋总算是交换了位置 …… 沈清秋又叫： “ 不要拔剑 ……” 那个 “ 剑 ” 字还没说完，公仪萧就稀里糊涂拔了剑，结果当然 是重蹈覆辙，拔到一半，剑柄就撞上了岩壁。 沈清秋提剑赶到，脱口叫道： “ 哎，笨呐！ ” 公仪萧好冤枉。其实沈清秋也清楚，只怪他反应太快，没听完喊话就行动了，换谁来都是 这个结果。可是，因为以往但凡有偶尔和洛冰河联手的时候，往往自己话都不用多说一句 ，洛冰河就能心领神会，完美应对，两相比较亲疏立分，沈清秋不能不又念起洛冰河的省 心和好处来。 这岩道扭扭曲曲，又很是幽暗，极利于那东西的行动，沈清秋又抓了一把符咒，它早就爬 得没影了。公仪萧不可思议道： “ 沈前辈，刚才那条 …… 蛇，就是之前你们在白露林遇到 的魔物？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 就它。也不知道，两边夹击，这东西是怎么溜走的。 ” 尚清华面不改色，从地上爬起，拍了拍衣服上的灰土，道： “ 贴着我爬过去的。 ” 公仪萧： “……” 沈清秋： “…… 走吧。这回都跟紧了。 ” 不用他说，这次，尚清华死都不肯离他超过两尺距离了！ 转得头都要晕了，三人终于转出了岩道。深入岩窟腹地，面前豁然开朗。 之前沈清秋一直想不明白，这岩窟的最深处，应当是日月无光的，为何还能长出 “ 日月露 华芝 ” 这种一听就是集天地之灵气日月之精华的东西来，这下终于搞懂了。 原来，这个窟洞顶端最高点，开了个豁天的大口子。日光月华，直接通过这个口子投下， 舞台聚光灯一样，打在洞中湖心一点之上。 而那块被一片晶光璀璨的小湖包围着的小小土堆，自然就是生养出日月露华芝的风水宝地 了。 尚清华肯定道： “ 露水湖。没错了。 ” 找对地方了。沈清秋得到确认，松了口气。 这可不是普通的湖水。而是无根朝露。无根水 + 朝露，灵气满蕴，滋养着日月露华芝。而 肉芝成熟之后，根须浸泡水土中，又能反过来滋养露水，如此循环往复，灵气生生不息， 永无枯竭之时。 公仪萧赞叹奇景的同时，终于清楚苍穹山派两位峰主此行目的了。 不过他仍有些奇怪。苍穹山也是出产仙草灵药的大派，每日收集来的奇珍异花只多不少。 这灵芝纵然精巧罕见，长得却不像能让人长生不老或直接突破飞升的模样，何至于劳动两 位峰主千里迢迢亲自来摘采。 沈清秋现在眼里只剩下湖心那片白花花的小肉芝们了。他一甩下摆，毅然踏入湖中。走了 十几步，露水漫过腰部，不温不凉，浸着皮肤，仿佛能滋润到人心底去。 虽然现在这些灵芝还小，长得跟豆芽菜似的，但等他找个灵气充沛风水上佳的地方种上去 ，再按照计划养大 …… 看着小土包上几十根白嫩嫩的小露芝，沈清秋犹豫了一下。毕竟露芝生长在此地，也算是 奇观一桩，都拔光了好像有点不厚道。可再想，此时不拔日后也是要被其他反派拔了，更 不厚道。而且万一搞砸种毁，多几颗总能有个补救的，但求万无一失，保险为上。 打定主意，他小心翼翼地每一根都带着一点土拔起，收袖子里去。 最后一颗露芝捏在手中，还没扔进袖子里，沈清秋突然听到身后传来拔剑之声。 他一回头，公仪萧已握剑在手，死死盯着他。 沈清秋原本以为公仪萧这是在抗议他这种乱摘花草的行为，可再看尚清华，也是一般的模 样，心知有变，屏住呼吸。 突然，湖面跃出一条长而硕大的东西，仿佛一条巨鱼，正面扑向沈清秋。 一张白而木然的脸孔迎面飞来。正是那个跟了他们一路的东西！ 同时，公仪萧手中剑诀已成，长剑风驰电掣飞向那东西。可它一扑沈清秋没扑中，便沉入 湖中，不再浮起，搅得湖底沉淀多年的沙土飞扬，浑浊不堪。公仪萧召回仙剑，道： “ 沈 前辈快上来！ ” 沈清秋却笑道： “ 不慌。我捉鱼玩儿。 ” 他站在原地不动，慢悠悠从怀里摸出一张符咒。 公仪萧道： “ 对付这东西一张符恐怕不 ……” 那个 “ 够 ” 字还没说出口，只见沈清秋搓人民币一样搓了搓那张符，一张瞬间变成一打。沈 清秋抓着那一打符咒，一拳打入水中。 数声巨响！ 湖面炸开十二朵逾丈高的水花。 原本潜藏在湖底的蛇人也被炸得飞出水面，抛了老高，重重摔在尚清华脚边的地面上。 沈清秋湿淋淋地上了岸，公仪萧得他眼神示意，用剑柄把那东西翻了过来。 一翻过来，三人悚然。 半晌，沈清秋才转头，问尚清华： “ 这是啥？ ” 尚清华挤出三个字： “…… 不知道！ ” 是真不知道。 这生物依稀是个人模样，披着满头长发，浑身软骨，皮肤又粗糙又硬，而且这一块那一块 ，遍布鳞片，像条刮鳞刮得不干净的蟒蛇。 虽然之前沈清秋以为它是女鬼，可仔细看它那张脸，虽然浮肿，仍依稀能看出，长得是个 男人模样。 尚清华询问的眼神望向沈清秋： “…… 我有吗？ ” 我有写过这种东西吗？ 沈清秋： “…… 应该没有。 ” 如果原作对它的描述超过了十个字，没理由他不记得！ 两人都巴巴地看向公仪萧。公仪萧也认不出来，微觉尴尬： “ 连二位仙师都不识此物，晚 辈更闻所未闻。 ” 尚清华忽然道： “ 让我说句。其实，这怪物也未必时天生就长这个样子啊。 ” 有点道理。看它奇形怪状的，怎么也不像是一个正常生物，倒更像一个畸形种，或者杂交 物。 沈清秋沉吟道： “ 天罚，诅咒，或者修炼禁术失败的修者。 ” 公仪萧道： “ 以上三种情况，倒确实有可能造出这种怪物。 ” 听到 “ 怪物 ” 二字，地上那只蛇男似乎有些狂躁，那条类似尾巴的东西狂乱地拍打起地面 来。尚清华忙闪开： “ 公仪少侠，公仪公子，你可不要乱说话，它好像听得懂的。换个词 ，换个词！ ” 它一直死死盯着沈清秋的袖子。沈清秋注意到，虽然这东西相貌狰狞可怖令人作呕，一头 乱发中的眼睛，居然清澈无比，和露水湖一模一样。 沈清秋恍然大悟： “ 怪不得它要攻击我们。你们看。 ” 他指道： “ 它的眼睛。多半是每日饮 取无根朝露才养成这样。再看鳞片，缝隙里面有些绿中微红的青苔，和岩壁上的如出一 辙。这岩窟是它常来常出入的地方。也许它是以露水湖的灵露为生的。 ” 而如果日月露华芝被采，相当于毁了灵气循环的动力，露水湖就会渐渐灵气耗尽，沦为一 潭废水，乃至干涸。所以这东西才会一路尾随，伺机攻击。 公仪萧问道： “ 可沈前辈，如果说那怪物饮取露水为生的话，直接吃了岂非更了当？为何 它先前不摘走这些露芝？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 之前在白露林中，我们一路被它纠缠，其中一次，它被剑身反射的阳光所灼 伤，这才退下。恐怕这东西不能见光，尤其是日光月光。所以它才只能在林荫、岩窟、水 底行动。 ” 他指了指一指山洞穹顶射下来的光束： “ 露芝地终日彻夜被日月华光笼罩，他当 然不得近身。 ” 为了验证，他拈了一枚幼嫩的露芝拿出来晃了晃。果然，那蛇男眼里放光，急切地昂头， 露出一口森森白牙。 公仪萧见状，剑柄一捅，又把它翻了过去。那蛇男艰难地在地上挣扎爬动，却翻不动身， 公仪萧剑锋对下，似乎要将它刺穿。沈清秋见状忙道： “ 慢着。 ” 公仪萧果然止住，不解道： “ 前辈？ ” 沈清秋委婉地道： “ 你说过，白露林方圆数里的百姓都未曾受过魔物侵袭？ ” “ 不错。 ” “ 如此便说明它从来没作恶过。又何必赶尽杀绝。说起来，它每天都到这岩窟里取引露水 ，反倒是我等一行闯入，惊扰了它。 ” 既然前辈开口，公仪萧当然必须听着。况且此话不假，如果这怪物真的杀伤过人命，幻花 宫早就发现它并且连根铲除了。正因从来不作，所以才不死。他便也收剑入鞘，见沈清秋 目光慈爱地凝视地上这只生物，只当他跟昭华寺的大师们一般信奉慈悲为怀那一套。他哪 知道，这种不明生物对沈清秋的吸引力，正如百花争艳的妹子们对普通终点读者的吸引 力。 可直到众人离开洞窟深处，谁也没注意到，地上这只苦苦挣扎的蛇男已经停了下来，微微 发颤。 畸形的身躯暗暗压住了一只细弱的露芝幼苗。那双格格不入的明亮眼睛里，仿佛烧起了熊 熊烈火。 出了白露林，公仪萧邀二人上幻花宫一坐，顺道通报老宫主。沈清秋推辞道： “ 事毕，已 得你相助，不好再多做打搅。 ” 开玩笑，上幻花宫干什么？一起开个赏芝大会？万一你们高层想不开，非要讨论一下它的 归属权呢？ 看公仪萧还要挽留，尚清华道： “ 这次就免了，要坐公仪少侠等下次吧。日后你来苍穹山 ，上清静峰再去坐，你沈前辈一定好好照顾你。 ” 沈清秋看他一眼。尚清华立刻闭嘴。 沈清秋这才调整表情，微笑道： “ 尚师弟所言甚是。届时清静峰静候。 ” 公仪萧知道清静峰一如其名，喜清静，不爱外客打扰，摸不准是不是客套话，却也笑了笑 ：“ 沈前辈这话我可记下了，日后说不定真有叨扰之机。那时我该将拜帖递给谁？ ” 沈清秋不假思索道： “ 给我那徒儿洛冰 ……” 此言一出，四周顿寂。气氛变得有点微妙。 卡壳片刻，沈清秋慢慢扑腾了两下折扇，生生接了下去： “…… 河的师兄明帆。 ” 公仪萧的心理活动十分复杂。 传言清静峰峰主自仙盟大会痛失爱徒之后，很长一段时间都沉浸在哀哀欲绝之痛里走不出 来，失魂落魄，如今看来他还是没有接受洛冰河已经离去的事实。也许这次根本就不是来 采芝的，只是为了出来散心，让他暂时忘记洛冰河的存在，不然为什么需要两位峰主来 呢？尚前辈一定是来看着沈前辈防止他做傻事的。没想到一路强颜欢笑还是被自己哪壶不 开提哪壶，勾起了伤心事 …… 果然，师徒情深！ 直到分道扬镳，公仪萧还十步一回头地望向沈清秋，眼神糅杂了尴尬、同情、哀伤、敬佩 种种复杂情绪。沈清秋被他看得有点毛骨悚然。 他只是一时嘴没留神，公仪萧究竟脑补了怎样的情节？ 尚清华感叹： “ 真的。原来是真的。 ” 沈清秋不轻不重踹他一脚： “ 什么真的假的？ ” 尚清华： “ 我观察你很久了，我有句话，憋在心里不说不舒服。瓜兄，你是不是真把洛冰 河当乖乖宝贝心肝徒弟来疼了？ ” 他有理有据地分析道： “ 听你们清静峰的弟子说，从仙盟大会回来那些天，沈师兄每日都 失魂落魄，神游天外。好几次都叫洛冰河叫出了声，还立了个剑冢长吁短叹。我先前还不 相信，刚才总算亲眼见证了。瓜兄，我真没想到，你是这样的人。 ” 我艹又是 “ 失魂落魄 ” ！这个词是要成为劳资人生中的污点么！ 我清静峰弟子个个走的都是腹有诗书气自华路线，什么时候变这么爱八卦的，这种鬼话也 能到处乱说，把师尊形象置于何地？！ 尚清华还不知死活： “ 瓜兄，我能不能问问，你到底是怎么看洛冰河的？我记得你是他的 粉吧，你喷了一堆我写的角色就是没喷过他。现在的他对你而言，是一个角色，还是一个 ……” 沈清秋背心涌上一阵恶寒。 向天打飞机菊苣这神神叨叨的追问，简直就像那种女高中生宿舍夜晚熄了灯后八卦时的语 气： “ 说！你是不是暗恋 XXX”“ 没、没有啦你胡说什么哪有的事！ ”“ 狡辩 ~ 不要害羞嘛 O(∩_∩)O 哈哈 ~”“ 讨厌，睡觉啦！ ”…… 雷。九天神雷！ 尚清华十分无辜。他其实是很正直地在求探讨交流，明明是沈清秋自己心中有鬼想太多。 沈清秋打断他： “ 你怎么还不行动？ ” 尚清华愣住了： “ 什么？ ” 沈清秋看着他，把马鞭塞过去： “ 公仪萧走了，总得有一个车夫。 ” “…… 你为什么就一次都没赶？ ” “ 你要体谅一个中毒的病人。 ” 屁的病人！ 是谁刚才手撕怪物符炸灵湖玩那么开心啊！ 要点脸！ 沈清秋躺在车厢之中，抖了抖袖子。 算算时间，距洛冰河从无间地狱重返人界，还有五年，不出意外绝对够保命了。 然而，他忘了《狂傲仙魔途》是一部什么尿性的奇文。如果小说的剧情在这种关键问题上 不出意外，那就一定不够精彩！,"CHAPTER 30: THE SNAKE-MAN OF THE DEW LAKE With Gongyi Xiao’s guidance, the three quickly broke through Huan Hua Palace’s protective array and pinpointed their location. The original novel had not described the place where the Sun-Moon Dew Mushroom grew in much detail, just a brief mention that “it was a stone cave covered by dense greenery.” Shang Qinghua had to stake his entire life, just to remember this bit of content. After all, this thing wasn’t meant for Luo Binghe, but arranged to be used by one of his opponents. It was precisely because of this that Shen Qingqiu dared to take action. If it was something affecting the main plotline, or some mystical flower or herb meant for Luo Binghe’s level-ups, he wouldn’t have the guts to try and steal it. Trying to steal resources from the male lead wouldn’t have such a sweet and forgiving conclusion as only being worse off than before. But since they were both villains, it should be fine if he steals it! Fortunately, though Bai Lu Forest was large, there was only one stone cave; it saved them quite a bit of trouble. Shen Qingqiu snapped his fingers, and a bright yellow flame springing to life at his fingertips. With a flick, the flame swam off into the depths of the damp, pitch-dark cave, a bright tail leisurely swishing behind it, opening up the path before them. At first, the stone path was still wide enough for three people to walk shoulder-to-shoulder, but the further they went, the narrower it became, until they had to turn sideways to get through. It twisted this way and that, like the coiled intestines of some giant beast. The lighting was poor: even Shen Qingqiu’s ball of flame flickered between bright and dim. He flicked out a few more; the balls of fire chased each other around. Gongyi Xiao took up the rear; Shang Qinghua had wanted to wait outside the cave, but Shen Qingqiu had dragged him in. Maybe he was scared or something, because he’d touch Shen Qingqiu’s arm from time to time, causing his arm to burst with goosebumps. Finally, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t take it anymore; because there was still an outsider here, he lowered his voice and said, “Can you stop pinching me?” There was no reply. But at least the touches stopped. Shen Qingqiu continued to grope his way forward, but suddenly, Shang Qinghua kicked him inthe calf. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help letting a “Fuck!” slip from his mouth. Shang Qinghua’s voice sounded from far behind. “Shenshixiong! Whatdidyousay?” His voice echoed through the twisting corridors, like it had been stretched by the distance. It turned out that unconsciously, Shen Qingqiu had been walking faster and faster while Shang Qinghua had dawdled, meaning Gongyi Xiao, who was taking up the rear, was also unable to pick up the pace; he’d already left the two of them quite a bit behind. If it wasn’t Shang Qinghua, then who had just been touching his arm? Or in other words, what had just been touching his arm? Shen Qingqiu ground to a halt. With a blank expression on his face, he patted his arm, attempting to brush off the goosebumps. A few balls of flame were still suspended in midair, burning faintly. The enemy’s in the dark; I’m in the light. With a flip of his left hand, Shen Qingqiu silently pulled out a couple of talismans from his sleeve, while his right hand slowly drew Xiu Ya. The sword grew increasingly brighter, but the only thing in front and behind was dark stone, giving off a damp, rank odor. He suddenly realized that just now, when something had collided with his calf, it didn’t feel like a kick from a foot. Rather, it was more like… a headbutt! Shen Qingqiu jerked his head down, and met gazes with a deathly pale and bloated face on the ground. Shen Qingqiu threw his talismans at the face with his left hand, and in an instant, the narrow stone pathway lit up with bursts of fire and flashes of lightning. He wanted to draw his sword, but didn’t realize that the space was too narrow: before he’d even drawn it halfway out of the sheath, his right arm knocked against the wall of the tunnel, the hilt of his sword also hitting the stone with a clang. That thing was soft and boneless, slithering back and forth on the ground like a giant snake, evading so quickly that even at this point-blank range, the talismans failed to hit, more agile than his movements. In the short time Shen Qingqiu had lost attempting to draw his sword, it had already reversed with a swish and slithered away, heading right in the direction of Shang Qinghua and Gongyi Xiao. He yelled, “Watch out! There’s something heading your way!” Hearing this, Shang Qinghua immediately turned around and yelled,“Young hero, quick! Let’s switch places!” He worked in logistics, how could he stand in the frontlines of a charge! Gongyi Xiao tried to do as instructed, but the pathway was already narrow enough to raise one’s hackles; there was only enough space for one person to walk with a fist’s width of margin left, so he couldn’t get around at all. Shang Qinghua heard Shen Qingqiu yell again from ahead, “On the ground! Look at the ground! It’s crawling on the ground!” When he turned his head again, he saw a snake-man slithering towards them. Shang Qinghua immediately made his decision, and collapsed on the spot! Gongyi Xiao had never seen such an eerie monster either, and froze for a moment, but upon seeing Shang Qinghua suddenly collapse to the ground, his face twitched and he reacted, with a, “My apologies!” and leapt over him… No matter how unsightly it’d been, the logistics and the vanguard finally managed to switch places… Shen Qingqiu yelled again, “Don’t draw your sword…” Before he could finish the word “sword,” Gongyi Xiao had carelessly tried to draw, and of course ended up suffering the same disastrous consequences: his hilt hitting the stone wall before the sword was halfway out. Shen Qingqiu finally arrived, holding his sword, and blurted out an, “Ah, idiot!” Gongyi Xiao was rather aggrieved. In truth, Shen Qingqiu also knew that the issue was his too-fast reflexes, causing him to move before he finished listening; anyone else would have done the same. But in the past, Shen Qingqiu had sometimes partnered with Luo Binghe, who could understand exactly what he wanted without needing him to say an extra word, and respond perfectly. The contrast was as clear as day; Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but miss the benefits and ease afforded by Luo Binghe. The stone corridor twisted back and forth, plus it was dark, so it was an extremely advantageous environment for that thing to move. Shen Qingqiu grabbed another handful of talismans, but it’d already long slithered away and disappeared. Gongyi Xiao said in disbelief, “Senior Shen, that… snake, was that the demonic creature you encountered in Bai Lu Forest?” Shen Qingqiu said, “It was. I still don’t know how this thing managed to escape from our pincer attack.” Without a change in expression, Shang Qinghua got up from the ground, patted the dust from his robes, and said, “By squeezing past me.” Gongyi Xiao: “…”Shen Qingqiu: “…Let’s go. This time, stay close behind me.” His reminder wasn’t necessary; this time, even on threat of death, Shang Qinghua refused to stray more than two feet away from him! After a dizzying number of twists and turns, the three finally made their way out of the stone corridor. Deep in the belly of the cave, they suddenly came to a wide clearing. Before, Shen Qingqiu had not understood; the depths of this cave should be completely absent of both sunlight and moonlight, how could something like the “Sun-Moon Dew Mushroom,” which by name clearly gathered spiritual energy from nature and the sun and moon’s essence, grow in this place? But now, he finally understood. As it turned out, at this cave’s highest point, a giant opening yawned up towards the sky. Sunlight and moonlight could fall through this opening, and like a spotlight, hit a single point at the heart of the cave’s lake. And that area of lake, illuminated by the glittering light, surrounded a tiny mound of soil; naturally this treasured location, bursting with fengshui, was where the Sun-Moon Dew Mushroom grew. Shang Qinghua said with conviction, “The dew lake. I’m certain.” They had found the right place. Having received confirmation, Shen Qingqiu let out a sigh of relief. This was no ordinary lake water. But rather, unsullied morning dew. Unsullied water + morning dew, brimming with spiritual energy, nourished the Sun-Moon Dew Mushroom. After the mushrooms matured, their mycelia would sink into the water and soil, and could nourish the dew water in return; by cycling it back and forth, the spiritual energy wouldn’t fade, never to be exhausted. Admiring the beautiful scene, Gongyi Xiao finally understood the objective of these two Cang Qiong Mountain peak lords. But he still found it a bit odd. Cang Qiong Mountain was also a major sect which produced mystical herbs and elixirs, the number of rare and treasured flowers they gathered every day could not be low. Though this mushroom was scarce and precious, it did not look like something that could grant immortality nor a breakthrough to ascension, so how did it merit two Peak Lords personally taking a long journey to collect it? Right now, the only things in Shen Qingqiu’s eyes were those small, white, fleshy pods in the center of the lake. With a sweep of his sleeves, he stepped resolutely into the lake. After a few dozen steps, the dew water passedhis waist, neither warm nor cold, soaking his skin; it felt as if it could soak right through to the heart. Though these mushrooms were still small, and looked just like bean sprouts, once they were planted somewhere with excellent fengshui and a bounty of spiritual energy, and nurtured according to plan… Seeing the dozens of small, tender, and white dew mushrooms growing on the little dirt mound, Shen Qingqiu hesitated. After all, the dew mushrooms growing here were a wonder of nature; to pick them clean seemed a bit immoral. But on second thought, if he didn’t pick them all now, another villain would still pick them later, which would be even more immortal. And if they messed up and destroyed one, it would be good to have a few extra as backup, just to be absolutely safe; insurance was the most important. Having made his decision, he carefully pulled up each together with a little soil, and stored them into his sleeves. When the last dew mushroom was in his hands, before he could throw it into his sleeves, Shen Qingqiu suddenly heard the sound of a sword being drawn behind him. When he turned around, Gongyi Xiao already had his sword in hand, staring straight at him. At first Shen Qingqiu thought Gongyi Xiao was protesting his haphazard method of collecting them, but when he looked at Shang Qinghua and saw him in the same stance, he knew something had gone wrong; he held his breath. Suddenly, something long and large leapt out of the surface of the lake; it looked like a giant fish, pouncing straight towards Shen Qingqiu. A pale and deadened face flew right at him. It was that thing that had been following them the entire time! At the same time, Gongyi Xiao finished forming his sword gesture, and his sword flew at that thing like a bolt of lightning. But once it missed its pounce, it sank into the lake and did not resurface, and stirred up the long-settled sandy dirt at the bottom of the lake, until it was turbid and murky. Gongyi Xiao called back his sword and said, “Senior Shen, come onshore, quick!” But Shen Qingqiu smiled and said, “Don’t panic. I want to go fishing.” He stood in place without moving, slowly pulling out a talisman from his lapels. Gongyi Xiao said, “Against this thing, a single talisman is probably not…” Before the “enough” could leave his mouth, he saw Shen Qingqiu rub thattalisman like he was rubbing a bill, and the single talisman suddenly became an entire stack. Holding that stack of talismans, Shen Qingqiu thrust his fist into the water. A chain of booms! The surface of the lake exploded, sending over twelve sprays of water, each more than ten feet high into the air. The snake-man hiding on the lake bottom was also thrown into the air by this explosion, tossed up high before crashing heavily to the ground by Shang Qinghua’s feet. Shen Qingqiu dripped his way back onto shore. After being given a meaningful look from him, Gongyi Xiao used the hilt of his sword to turn it over. After it was turned over, all three were horror-struck. After a long time, Shen Qingqiu turned to look at Shang Qinghua. “What is this?” Shang Qinghua squeezed out three words. “… I don’t know!” He really didn’t know. This creature was vaguely human-like: it had a full head of long hair, but seemed entirely composed of cartilage; its skin was rough and hard and covered in patches of scales here and there, like a python half-scraped of its scales. Though Shen Qingqiu had originally thought it was a female ghost, after taking a closer look at that face, though it was bloated, he could faintly see that it was the face of a man. Shang Qinghua gave Shen Qingqiu a questioning look. “…Did I?” Did I write about this kind of thing? Shen Qingqiu “…I don’t think so.” If the original novel had given it more than ten words of description, there was no way he wouldn’t have remembered! The two looked hopefully at Gongyi Xiao. Gongyi Xiao couldn’t recognize it either, and felt a bit awkward. “Even the two masters cannot recognize this creature; it is even more unfamiliar to this junior.” Shang Qinghua suddenly said, “Let me say something. Actually, this might not be this creature’s natural form.” Made sense. Looking at this grotesque form, it did not seem like a normal creature at all, but rather a deformed specimen, or a crossbreed. Shen Qingqiu muttered, “Punishment from the heavens, a curse, or a cultivator who had failed to cultivate a forbidden technique?” Gongyi Xiao: “All three of those, indeed could create this kind ofmonster.” The snake-man on the ground seemed to be irritated by the word “monster”, and its tail-like thing started to furiously slap the ground. Shang Qinghua hurriedly dodged away. “Young hero Gongyi, young master Gongyi, don’t make irresponsible remarks, it seems like it can understand us. Use a different word, a different word!” It kept its gaze fixed on Shen Qingqiu’s sleeve. Shen Qingqiu noticed that though this creature looked sinister and terrifying enough to make one retch, the eyes gazing through its curtain of tangled hair were incomparably clear, just like the water of the dew lake. Shen Qingqiu had a sudden realization. “No wonder it attacked us. Look.” He pointed. “Its eyes. They’ve probably become like that because it drank unsullied morning dew every day. Now look at its scales: there’s lichen growing between the cracks, green with a bit of red, the exact same kind that grows on the stone walls. It’s been entering and leaving this cave for a long time. Perhaps it’s been living off the spiritual dew within the dew lake.” And if the Sun-Moon Dew Mushroom was picked, it would be equivalent to destroying the main force behind the circulation of spiritual energy: the spiritual energy in the dew lake would gradually be depleted, and eventually become a pool of wastewater, even dry up completely. That was why this creature had been following them the whole time, waiting for a chance to attack. Gongyi Xiao asked, “But Senior Shen, if that monster has been living off the dew water, wouldn’t it be better to eat them directly? Why did it never pick the dew mushrooms?” Shen Qingqiu said, “When we were in Bai Lu Forest, it was hampering us the entire time. Once, it only retreated after it was burned by the sunlight reflecting off the sword blade. Perhaps this thing cannot stand light, especially light from the sun and moon. So it can only move within the shade of forests, inside caves, and beneath the water. He pointed at the beam of light shafting down from the cave’s domed ceiling. “The dew mushrooms are steeped in sunlight or moonlight all day and all night; of course it could not approach.” As confirmation, he pulled out a tender dew mushroom and swung it back and forth. As expected, the snake-man’s eyes lit up and it urgently craned its neck, showing a mouthful of dense white teeth. Seeing this, Gongyi Xiao prodded it with the hilt of his sword, and flipped it over again. The snake-man strained, struggling and wriggling on the ground, but couldn’t turn back over; Gongyi Xiao held his sword point-down, seeminglypreparing to stab it though. Shen Qingqiu saw this and hurriedly said, “Wait.” As expected, Gongyi Xiao stopped, and asked in confusion, “Senior?” Shen Qingqiu said tactfully, “You said before, that the common people within a several-kilometer radius from Bai Lu Forest had never suffered demonic attacks?” “Yes.” “Then that means it has never done anything malicious. There’s no need to exterminate it. Speaking of which, all it had done every day was collect the dew water in this cave; we were the ones who intruded inside, and disturbed it.” Since his senior had spoken, of course Gongyi Xiao had to obey. And what he said was true, if this monster really had killed or harmed any humans, Huan Hua Palace would have discovered and eradicated it long ago. It was precisely because it had never done any harm that it had never been killed. So, he resheathed his sword; seeing that Shen Qingqiu was looking at the creature on the ground with a benevolent gaze, Gongyi Xiao only thought that he was of the same type as the masters from Zhao Hua Temple, who believed in mercy and charity. He could never have known, that Shen Qingqiu’s interest in these strange creatures was equivalent to a normal Zhongdian reader’s interest in the hundreds of flower-like maidens, all competing in beauty. Even after they had all left the depths of the cave, no one had noticed that the snake-man strenuously struggling on the ground had already stopped, and was instead shivering slightly. Pressed under its deformed body was a small and thin dew mushroom sprout. In that pair of incongruously bright eyes, a raging fire seemed to start burning. After exiting Bai Lu Forest, Gongyi Xiao invited the two to visit Huan Hua Palace, as well as notify the Old Palace Master. Shen Qingqiu declined. “After all, we have already gained your assistance, it would be impolite to trouble you further.” You’re joking, go to Huan Hua Palace? For what? A flower-viewing party? What if your higher-ups take things too seriously and insist on discussing property rights? Seeing that Gongyi Xiao still wanted to keep them, Shang Qinghua said, “Young hero Gongyi, let’s dispense with courtesy this time, we can visit next time. If you come to Cang Qiong Mountain in the future, you can visit Qing Jing Peak, your senior Shen will definitely look after you well.” Shen Qingqiu gave him a look. Shang Qinghua immediately shut up.Shen Qingqiu finally adjusted his expression, and said with a smile, he said, “As Shang-shidi says. Qing Jing Peak awaits your arrival.” Gongyi Xiao knew that just like its name, Qing Jing Peak was fond of peace and quiet, and did not like to be disturbed by outside guests; he wasn’t sure if these were just words of courtesy, but smiled either way. “I will remember Senior Shen’s words; I may truly have the chance to disturb you in the future. At the time, to whom should I send the message announcing my arrival?” Without a second thought, Shen Qingqiu said, “Give it to my disciple, Luo Bing…” After he spoke, everyone fell silent. The atmosphere turned a bit odd. After getting stuck for a moment, Shen Qingqiu slowly flapped his fan twice, and stiffly continued on, “…he’s shixiong, Ming Fan.” Gongyi Xiao’s heart filled with conflicted feelings. Rumors said that after the Qing Jing Peak peak lord lost his beloved disciple at the Immortal Alliance Conference, he’d fallen into inconsolable heartbreak for a long time, beside himself with grief; seeing him now, it looked like he still hadn’t accepted that Luo Binghe was already gone. Perhaps he hadn’t gone out to pick the mushroom at all, but just to take his mind off things, so he could briefly forget Luo Binghe’s existence. Otherwise, why would two Peak Lords come in person? Senior Shang must have come to supervise Senior Shen and make sure he didn’t do anything stupid. But after forcing a smile onto his face this whole trip, he’d managed to poke his sore spot himself and bring up melancholy things… as expected, what a deep master-and-disciple bond! Until they parted ways, Gongyi Xiao kept looking back at Shen Qingqiu every ten steps, his gaze a complicated mix of awkwardness, sympathy, sorrow, and admiration. Shen Qingqiu was a bit creeped out by this gaze. It was only a slip of the tongue; what stories were Gongyi Xiao making up in that head of his? Shang Qinghua sighed. “It’s true. It’s actually true.” Shen Qingqiu kicked him, neither heavy or light. “What’s true?” Shang Qinghua: “I’ve been watching you for a while, and I have something to say; it’s uncomfortable keeping it in. Cucumber-bro, did you really see Luo Binghe as the apple of your eye, and adored him as your darling baby and disciple?” He analyzed the evidence piece by piece. “I heard your Qing Jing Peak disciples say that ever since returning from the Immortal Alliance Conference, Shen-shixiong has been beside himself with grief, his mind wandering all overthe place. So many times, you’d call Luo Binghe’s name, and stand in front of that sword mound and sigh in sorrow. I didn’t believe it, but just now I’ve finally witnessed it with my own eyes. Cucumber-bro, I really never thought that you were this sort of person.” Fuck, “beside yourself” again?! Is this phrase going to be the stain on my lifetime’s worth of hard work?! My Qing Jing Peak disciples all walk the path of scholarly detachment; when did they become so gossipy? Spreading this sort of nonsense everywhere, where are you placing your Shizun’s image?! Shang Qinghua continued to dig his own grave. “Cucumber-bro, can I ask, how did you see Luo Binghe? I remember you were one of his fans, right: you roasted a huge bunch of the characters I wrote, but even so you never roasted him. To you, is he a character, or is he a…” A chill ran up Shen Qingqiu’s back. This bizarre interrogation from “Great Master” Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky was basically just like high-school girls gossiping in the dorms after lights-out. “Tell me! Do you have a crush on ___” “N-no, what are you talking about!” “Dodging the question~ Don’t be shy O(∩_∩)O haha~” “I hate you, go to bed!”… Lightning. Lightning from the nine heavens! Shang Qinghua was completely innocent. He was actually making an honest inquiry and seeking a discussion, it was Shen Qingqiu who had skeletons in his closet, and was thinking too much. Shen Qingqiu interrupted him. “You’re still not moving?” Shang Qinghua stared. “What?” Shen Qingqiu looked at him, then shoved the reins into his hand. “Gongyi Xiao left; we still need a driver.” “…Why haven’t you driven even once?” “You should be considerate towards a poisoned invalid.” Invalid, my ass! Who was happily fighting monsters and blowing up spiritual lakes just now! Have some face! Shen Qingqiu laid back in the carriage and shook out his sleeves. Thinking about the time, there were still five years before Luo Binghe would return from the Endless Abyss to the Human Realm; if nothing went wrong, it was definitely enough to save his life.However, he had forgotten the kind of stupid work Proud Immortal Demon Way was. If nothing went wrong at such a crucial junction in a novel’s storyline, that meant it wasn’t exciting enough!"
三年转眼过。 这三年间，除了不时有求于柳清歌帮他通脉疗毒，拜托木清芳帮他配几方味药材，上清静 峰给弟子们布置一下练级任务，沈清秋大部分时间都在外晃荡。 日子过得悠哉游哉，直到岳清源一封飞书，突然召他回苍穹山。 鉴于峰主已好长一段时间鬼影子都见不着，此番忽然回山，清静峰弟子们早早就聚在山门 之下迎接。一见沈清秋慢吞吞从山梯下爬上来，呼啦一下都围了过去。 为首的明帆已经是高瘦的青年，虽然不能说英俊非凡，但也算五官齐整，好歹不像少年时 期那样尖嘴猴腮、一看就一张心胸狭窄的死炮灰脸。宁婴婴更是长成了身材妙曼的楚楚少 女，一见沈清秋就扑过来，拖着他胳膊往登天梯上走。 虽说香喷喷的小姑娘来搂他实乃人间美事，沈清秋却无福消受。尤其是宁婴婴发育的不错 ，已不是当初小巧玲珑的萝莉了，胸部偶尔不小心蹭到他，蹭得沈清秋面无表情冷汗直流 ，又想起了狂傲仙魔途书评区那两栋求阉沈清秋的高楼。 宁婴婴撒娇道： “ 师尊你总是不在山上，徒儿们可都想死你了。 ” 沈清秋慈爱道： “ 为师也想你 …… 们。 ” 不对啊。你想的应该是洛冰河，想个人渣反派做什么。而且你作为洛冰河他老婆之一本来 难道不是应该一连五年都夜不能寐食不下咽骨瘦如柴肝肠寸断吗？ 为什么现在一看反而胖了一圈！ 弟子们簇拥着沈清秋上穹顶峰。穹顶殿中，十二峰峰首已全部就座，座后都侍立着一两名 峰主的心腹弟子，只有柳清歌例外。 百战峰传统风格就是放羊式教育，各练各的，峰主除了时不时冒个泡回来把一群弟子暴打 一顿，基本不教别的，直到弟子能把师父打回去，峰主之位就可以交接了 √ 所以当然没有 什么心腹弟子。 沈清秋一一招呼过，也在排于第二位的清静峰位上落座，明帆与宁婴婴站在他身后。对面 的就是仙姝峰的齐清萋与柳溟烟。 岳清源还没宣告开会，沈清秋一开一合把玩手中折扇，把每名峰主和他们身后的弟子都看 了一圈，心想，若是洛冰河还在，站在他身后的恐怕就不会有别人了。苍穹山派下一辈中 最出彩的弟子也绝无悬念了。 正胡思乱想，岳清源开口了： “ 诸位同门可知金兰城此地？ ” 尚清华道： “ 略有耳闻，地处中原，乃是洛川与衡川两大河流的交接之地。城主重商，据 说十分繁华。 ” 岳清源点头道： “ 不错。金兰城水陆往来四通八达，向来是四方商贾聚集场所，可两个月 前，金兰城闭城了。非但城门不得通行，书信也无法递传。 ” 一座好端端的商业城市，忽然闭城，就跟金融中心忽然切断与其他方的来往一样，不可理 喻。绝对还有下文。 沈清秋端起手边的茶盏，刮了刮表面的茶叶，道： “ 金兰城离昭华寺最近，印象中往来也 甚为密切，若真出了什么事，寺中各位大师理应察觉异常。 ” 岳清源道： “ 不错，二十天之前，有一名金兰城商人由水路从城中逃出，赶到了昭华寺求 救。 ” 他用了 “ 逃 ” 这个字，看来事态真是十分严重。殿中一片肃然。 “ 那名中年男子原先是金兰城中第一号兵器铺的店主，常年在昭华寺供奉香火，寺中僧人 不少都认识。 ” “ 他当时浑身裹着严严实实的黑布，只露出半张脸。来到昭华寺时已经精疲力竭，倒在山 阶之前，反复说，城中有可怕的瘟疫。 ” “ 护山僧人立刻把他抬进大殿，上报主持。而等主持与几位大师赶出来时，已经晚了。 ” 柳清歌： “ 死了？ ” 岳清源： “ 那商人已经化作一具白骨。 ” 刚刚还说拼死累活逃到了庙门口，怎么能转眼就化为一具白骨？ 沈清秋沉吟道： “ 师兄方才说，那商人身上裹着黑布？从头裹到脚？ ” 岳清源道： “ 正是。期间有僧人想帮他除去黑布，却一碰他就哀声嘶号，痛苦难当，犹如 撕扯皮肤血肉，于是不敢再强行拉扯。 ” “ 昭华寺诸位方丈深感不安，商议之下，连夜派出了无尘大师等几位佛门前辈去查探。至 今不见归来。 ” 无字辈的大师比起沈清秋他们来说，辈分只高不低，论修为也不会差到哪里去。沈清秋微 觉诧异： “ 一位都没有回来？ ” 岳清源沉沉点头，道： “ 幻花宫与天一观也派去了十几名弟子，同样，有去无回。 ” 四大派已经都三派都被拉下水了，苍穹山自然不能袖手旁观，难怪要动用急召。果然，岳 清源道： “ 诸位别派道友无奈之下，飞书并使者前来向苍穹山请求支援。支援是一定的， 只是兹事重大，恐有异族宵小在背后推波助澜，兴风作浪。有人前去，也必须有人留 守。 ” 避免出现纱华铃那次空门大开的情况。 “ 异族 ” 不消说，指的绝对只有魔族。柳清歌第一个道： “ 百战峰。愿护送木师弟前往。 ” 既然城里闹瘟疫，千草峰的木清芳那是必须要出动的。沈清秋一看，这要去的两位，一个 负责给他煎药的，一个负责帮他打通灵脉的，都去了，又没有主角光环护体，会不会有个 三长两短，还真让人担心，不看着点怎么行，忙接道： “ 清秋愿一同前往。 ” 岳清源道： “ 我的原意是安排你守山。 ” 怎么对付他沈清秋还不知道，纠缠不休就行了： “ 掌门师兄何必把我想得那么孱弱。清秋 纵使不才，对魔族种种却略知一二，如果真是它们捣鬼，多少也能有所助益。 ” 魔族相关的移动百科全书，无论原装货还是现货都绝对能担此称号。清静峰那积累了几百 年历代峰主不读完不许继位的卷宗古籍可都在竹舍后面堆着呢 …… 岳清源一想，让他和柳 清歌木清芳一同行动，倒方便压制他身上的无可解，打起架来百战峰峰主也能护着，于是 ，最后分成三批人，以柳木沈三人为开道先锋，前去金兰城先探查一番。第二批次在外， 依情况而动。第三批留守苍穹山。 事态紧急，没时间慢悠悠车马舟船，沈清秋其实不喜欢御剑，但知道这时候必须跟随大部 队步调。三人御剑出发，半天不到，沈清秋自云丛上方往下望，提气对两个同门喊道： “ 下方就是洛川和衡川的交汇处！ ” 从高空俯瞰，果然有两条川水交叉，仿佛两条蜿蜒而绵长纤细的银带，在阳光下闪闪发光 ，犹似银鳞乱舞。 其中一条，就是当年刚出生的洛冰河被投放顺水而下、并以之为姓的洛川。 三人选择一处开阔平坦的山头作为着陆点。从这里隐隐能看到远处金兰城的飞檐勾角，紧 闭的城门和拉起的河桥。 沈清秋把遮阳的手从眉间放下： “ 我们为什么不直接飞进城里去？ ” 木清芳解释道： “ 昭华寺曾应金兰城城主之请，为他们布了覆盖上空的巨型结界，禁止仙 剑或任何带灵气魔气的东西从上方飞过，否则都会被打偏轨道。 ” 昭华寺设结界的本事沈清秋是见识过的，仙盟大会御用结界天团。若他们排第二，没哪家 敢排第一，沈清秋不再发问。 既然不能空降，也不能从大门进去，一定有别的渠道。果然，被岳清源详细交代过各项事 宜的木清芳领着两人穿入一片树林，绿荫掩映中，传来水流潺潺之声。 那声音是从一个低矮的洞穴中发出的。木清芳招呼两人过来，道： “ 这里有一条暗河。暗 河可以通往城内。 ” 沈清秋了然： “ 那个兵器铺商人，就是从这里逃出来的？ ” 木清芳点头： “ 有些做地下买卖的商人会在此碰头，或者偷运货物。知道这条路的人其实 不多，但那兵器商人与昭华寺几位方丈交好，曾经吐露过一些。 ” 洞穴口爬满绿藤，只齐胸口高，三人弯腰才能进去，走了一段，终于感觉头上宽敞了。水 流变成了哗哗声。河床之旁泊着几艘破破烂烂的孤船。 沈清秋挑了艘稍微好点不至于漏水的，指尖一弹，船头挂着的那盏枯灯中燃起一团火光。 左看右看，桨只有一只。沈清秋做了个 “ 请 ” 的姿势，对柳清歌道： “ 这是逆流。划进城去 ，肯定需要我们当中臂力最强的人。师弟请？ ” 柳清歌黑着脸夺过那支细长的船篙，任劳任怨开始划船。每划一下，船身就往前蹿出老 远。船头灯盏嘎吱乱晃。 沈清秋拉木清芳坐下，瞥船边水光，居然能看到几尾游鱼欢快地甩尾而过，顺口道： “ 这 水好清。 ” 刚说完这句话，游鱼后面，跟着飘来了更大的一滩东西。 脸朝下埋在水中的一具尸体。,"CHAPTER 31: THE MYSTERY OF PLAGUE CITY Three years went by in the blink of an eye. During these three years, other than sometimes asking Liu Qingge for assistance in clearing his meridians and treating his poison, requesting Mu Qingfang to prescribe him some medicine, and going to Qing Jing Peak briefly to arrange training for the disciples, Shen Qingqiu spent most of his time wandering about outside. He passed his days leisurely, until an urgent notice from Yue Qingyuan came in, suddenly summoning him back to Cang Qiong Mountain. Considering that even the Peak Lord’s shadow hadn’t been seen in such a long time, this time when he returned to the mountain, the Qing Jing Peak disciples had long gathered at the mountain gates to welcome him. As soon as they saw Shen Qingqiu climb up the mountain steps, very slowly, they all flocked towards him. The one leading them, Ming Fan, had already become a lanky young man; though you couldn’t say he was extraordinarily handsome, his features could still be considered neat; anyhow not unfortunate-looking like he’d been in his youth, with a petty cannon fodder’s face that was obvious at a single glance. Ning Yingying, even more so, had become a lovely young lady with a splendid figure; upon seeing Shen Qingqiu she rushed over and grabbed his arm, pulling him up the Heaven-Ascending Stairs. While a sweet-smelling maiden pulling him towards herself was indeed a wonderful thing, Shen Qingqiu unfortunately couldn’t enjoy it. Especially because Ning Yingying had developed quite nicely, and was no longer that dainty and delicate little girl of the past: sometimes her chest would accidentally brush him. Brushed him until Shen Qingqiu, face still expressionless, was streaming with cold sweat, having once again thought of those two long chains of posts in the Proud Immortal Demon Way’s comment section, demanding for Shen Qingqiu to be castrated. Playing cute, Ning Yingying said, “Shizun, you’re always away from the mountain; your disciples all miss you so much.” Shen Qingqiu affectionately said, “This master has also missed you… all.” Something’s wrong. Shouldn’t the one you miss be Luo Binghe; why are you thinking about a scum villain. And as one of Luo Binghe’s wives, weren’t you originally supposed to suffer five continuous years of sleepless nights and no appetite, be emaciated and broken-hearted?Why does it look like you’ve become plumper instead! The disciples escorted Shen Qingqiu to Qiong Ding Peak. In Qiong Ding Peak’s Main Hall, the twelve peak lords had already all sat down; behind each one stood one or two of that peak lord’s trusted disciples, with the exception of Liu Qingge. Traditionally, hands-off education was Bai Zhan Peak’s way; everyone trained on their own; other than the peak lord occasionally popping up to beat up a bunch of disciples, they generally wouldn’t teach anything else; this would continue until a disciple could fight their master off, then the peak lord’s seat could handed over √ So of course he didn’t have any trusted disciples. Shen Qingqiu greeted each one, and also sat down in the second seat, Qing Jing Peak’s spot, with Ming Fan and Ning Yingying standing behind him. In front of him was Xian Shu Peak’s Qi Qingqi and Liu Mingyan. Yue Qingyuan had yet to announce the start of the meeting, so Shen Qingqiu open and shut the folding fan in his hand, playing with it, while looking around at all the Peak lords and their disciples; he thought, if Luo Binghe was still here, no one else would be standing behind him. It was no mystery who the most outstanding disciple of Cang Qiong Mountain Sect’s next generation was. His thoughts were still running wild, when Yue Qingyuan spoke. “Does everyone know where Jin Lan City is?” Shang Qinghua said, “I’ve heard a little about it: it’s located in the Central Plains, where the two great rivers, Luo and Heng, meet. The city values trade; it’s said to be greatly prosperous.” Yue Qingyuan nodded and said, “Correct. Jin Lan City is accessible from all sides, by both land and water, so merchants from all over have always gathered there. But two months ago, Jin Lan City shut its gates. Not only are the gates unusable, even letters cannot go through.” A healthy, thriving trade city suddenly shutting its gates, was like a financial center suddenly breaking off all relations with other locations; it was illogical. There absolutely had to be more to it. Shen Qingqiu lifted the tea cup by his hand and blew at the tea leaves on the surface, then said, “Nearest to Jin Lan City is Zhao Hua Temple; my impression was that their relationship was very close; if something did happen, the masters at the Temple should have realized something was wrong. Yue Qingyuan said, “Correct; twenty days ago, a merchant from Jin Lan City escaped the city via canal, and rushed to Zhao Hua Temple to cry for help.” To use the word “escaped,” it looked like the situation was incrediblyserious. The entire hall was solemn. “That middle-aged man was the owner of Jin Lan City’s first weapons shop, and over the years had gone to Zhao Hua Temple to pray and burn incense, so quite a few of the Temple’s monks knew him. “At that time, he was swathed completely in black cloth, with only half of his face exposed. He was already completely exhausted by the time he arrived at Zhao Hua Temple, and collapsed on the mountain steps, repeatedly saying that there was a terrifying plague within the city.” The monks guarding the mountain immediately carried him into the main hall, and reported to the one in charge. And by the time they rushed out with several other masters, it was already too late.” Liu Qingge: “He died?” Yue Qingyuan: “That merchant had already decayed into a skeleton.” He’d just said that he’d exhausted himself escaping to the Temple gates; how could he have decayed into a skeleton in the blink of an eye? Shen Qingqiu muttered to himself, “Shixiong just said, that merchant was swathed in black cloth? From head to toe?” Yue Qingyuan said. “Precisely. During the wait, a monk tried to help him remove the black cloth, but the moment they touched him he would scream in terrible pain, like his skin and flesh were being ripped off, so they didn’t dare pull it off by force. “The Zhao Hua Temple abbots were deeply disturbed, and after discussion, they sent out Master Wu Chen and several Buddhist elders to investigate, that very night. As of today, they have yet to return.” Compared to Shen Qingqiu and the rest, all masters of the “Wu” generation were higher in seniority, so their cultivation couldn’t be too shabby. Shen Qingqiu was a bit flabbergasted. “None of them came back?” Yue Qingyuan solemnly nodded and said, “Huan Hua Palace and Tian Yi Monastery have also sent over ten disciples, with the same result: no one returned.” Three of the four major sects had been dragged into the mess, so naturally Cang Qiong Mountain couldn’t passively look on; no wonder he’d used an emergency summon. Indeed, Yue Qingyuan said, “With no other choice, our fellow cultivators from the other sects sent Cang Qiong Mountain an urgent letter, pleading for our assistance. That we’ll assist them is certain; only this is a serious situation; I’m afraid there might be scatterings of other races fanning the flames behind our backs, stirring up havoc. Some will go, but some must alsostay behind on watch.” To prevent a situation like that time with Sha Hualing, where they had been completely vulnerable. Needless to say, “other races” could only refer to the demons. Liu Qingge was first to say, “Bai Zhan Peak. Willing to escort Mu-shidi there.” Since there was a plague in the city, Qian Cao Peak’s Mu Qingfang definitely had to go. Shen Qingqiu looked at the two who were going: one responsible for making his medicine, the other responsible for clearing his meridians; both were going and neither had a protagonist’s halo to protect them; what if they met with an unexpected accident. This was really too worrisome; how could he not watch over them a little, so he rushed to say, “Qingqiu is willing to go with.” Yue Qingyuan said, “My original idea was for you to watch the mountain.” Could Shen Qingqiu not know how to deal with him; all he needed to do was pester him endlessly. “There is no need for Zhangmen-shixiong to think me so fragile. Even if Qingqiu is untalented, and knows very little about demons; if they are the ones making mischief, I can still be of some benefit.” The walking demon encyclopediawhether the original goods or current goods, both could definitely be given this title. In Qing Jing Peak accumulated several hundreds of years’ worth of records and ancient books, that each peak lord had to finish reading before they could succeed, all piled at the back of the Bamboo House… Yue Qingyuan thought for a while; if he let him go with Liu Qingge and Mu Qingfang, it would actually make it easier to suppress the Without-a-Cure within his body; if they got into a fight the Bai Zhan Peak Lord could also protect him; therefore, in the end everyone was divided into three groups: the Liu-Shen-Mu trio would clear the way as the vanguard, and first go to Jin Lan City and investigate. The second group would wait outside, in case the situation changed. The third group would take care of things on Cang Qiong Mountain. The situation was urgent, so there was no time to leisurely take a carriage or boat; Shen Qingqiu actually disliked flying on his sword, but knew that at this time, he needed to follow the main force’s pace. The trio flew out on their swords; before half a day had passed, Shen Qingqiu gazed downwards from above, took a deep breath and yelled to his two sect siblings, “The Luo and Heng River junction is right below us!” When looking down from a great height, there were indeed two rivers meeting each other, like two winding, thin and endless silver ribbons, sparklingbeneath the sunlight, akin to a haphazard dance of silver scales. One of the two, was the one Luo Binghe had been placed in the year he’d been born, left to drift downstream: the Luo River from which his surname had come. The trio chose to descend at a wide and level hilltop. From here they could faintly see the roofs of the far-off Jin Lan City, its tightly closed gates and the raised drawbridge. Shen Qingqiu lowered the hand he’d been shading his eyes with. “Why didn’t we fly straight into the city?” Mu Qingfang explained, “In the past, at Jin Lan City’s governor’s request, Zhao Hua Temple cast an enormous barrier covering their sky, preventing immortal swords or anything with spiritual or demonic qi from passing through: they’ll be forced to veer off-course.” Shen Qingqiu had personally witnessed Zhao Hua Temple setting up a barrier before: the group of barrier masters specially used by the Immortal Alliance Conference. If they were ranked second no one would dare rank first; Shen Qingqiu didn’t ask further questions. Since they couldn’t descend by air, and couldn’t enter through the gates, there had to be some other means. Indeed, Mu Qingfang, who Yue Qingyuan had briefed in detail about various matters, guided the duo through a forest, and from behind the shade of the trees, came the murmur of flowing water. That sound was coming out of a low cave. Mu Qingfang waved the duo over and said, “There’s an underground river here. The river leads into the city..” Shen Qingqiu understood. “That weapons merchant escaped through here?” Mu Qingfang nodded. “Several merchants who participate in black market dealings, meet up or smuggle goods through here. Not many people know about this route, but that weapons merchant had a good relationship with several of Zhao Hua Temple’s abbots, and disclosed some things to them.” The cave entrance was covered in vines, and was only as tall as their chests; they had to stoop to enter; after walking for a while, they finally felt the ceiling rise. The sound of flowing water became gurgling. Several shabby, worn- out boats were anchored next to the riverbed. Shen Qingqiu chose a slightly better ship that at least didn’t leak, then flicked his fingers; the lamp hanging at the bow flamed with light. After looking left and right, he only found one oar. Shen Qingqiu made a “please” gesture, and said to Liu Qingge. “We’ll be going against the current. Rowing into the citywill require the person with the best arm strength among us. Shidi, please?” With a dark expression, Liu Qingge took that long, thin boat oar, and diligently began to row. With each stroke, the boat leapt forwards an incredible distance. The lamp at the bow creaked and swayed jerkily. Shen Qingqiu helped Mu Qingfang sit down, and glanced at the glittering water by the boat; he could even see several fish happily swishing their tails as they swam by, and said in passing, “This water is so clear.” Right after saying this, something much larger drifted in after the swimming fish. Face-down in the water was a corpse."
沈清秋猛地坐直了。 浮尸啊靠靠靠！ 刚说完一句 “ 水好清啊 ” 你就给我飘过来一具浮尸，打脸啪啪的不要这么重行吗！ 柳清歌用船篙勾住那具浮尸，把他翻个身，居然又是一具白骨。因为全身包括脑袋都用黑 布缠住，脸又朝下泡着，刚才才没觉察。 沈清秋问道： “ 木师弟，你知道这世上，有哪种瘟疫，会让人全身瞬间化为白骨的吗？ ” 木清芳摇头： “ 闻所未闻。 ” 逆水行舟，不进则退，定了好一会儿，小船已后退了一段距离，柳清歌又撑起了篙子，片 刻之后道： “ 前面还有。 ” 果然，从前方陆陆续续飘来五六具浮尸，都是身缠黑布的白骨，与第一具如出一辙。 沈清秋正凝神细思，忽然，柳清歌把长膏往旁边石壁上一插。又细又脆的竹篙，居然直直 插入了坚硬无缝的石块。船身被固定，停在原地不动。沈清秋也觉察有异，霍然起身： “ 谁？ ” 前方黑暗深处，传来一阵急促的呼吸，船头灯火隐隐照出个人的轮廓。只听一个少年的声 音说道： “ 你们是什么人？鬼鬼祟祟在暗河里想干什么？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 这话我倒也想问同在此地的你。 ” 他虽然是站在一艘小破船上面，但青衣黑发，腰悬长剑，举手投足气定神闲，看起来也颇 仙风道骨。加之沈清秋现在装 B 已经装出了经验，装出了自己的风格，还是很能唬住人 的。那少年果然未料到他是如此人模狗样，愣了半晌，才喝道： “ 你们走吧！现在不许进 城！ ” 柳清歌哼道： “ 凭你？拦得住谁？ ” 那少年道： “ 城里有瘟疫，不想死就滚！ ” 木清芳温声道： “ 小兄弟，我们正是为此而来 ……” 那少年看说不走，怒道： “ 听不懂人话是不是？你们快滚！不然我不客气！ ” 话音未落，一 杆枪矛刺来，虎虎生风的倒也蛮吓人。柳清歌冷笑一声，拔出墙中的竹桨。篙尖一挑，对 方已掀飞入水。沈清秋听那少年沉在水里扑腾还在呸呸大骂，问： “ 捞不捞？ ” 柳清歌： “ 中气十足的捞什么捞。进城了。 ” 继续划船。 三人从暗河中出来，这非法船只便顺水飘回黑暗中去了。这出口在城里最荒芜的一片浅泽 里，不见一人。三人朝城中央走了一会儿，忽然身后有人踏踏踏追上来。 那落汤鸡一般的少年冲上来，气急败坏道： “ 让你们别进城！进来有什么用？之前说来救 瘟疫的人多了去了，什么大和尚牛鼻子，什么什么花宫，还不是个个都出不去了！自己找 死！ ” 原来这少年黑暗里伏击，倒是为他们着想了。沈清秋道： “ 那我们都进来了，你说该怎么 办？ ” 少年道： “ 还能怎么办？跟着我别乱跑！我带你们找大和尚去。 ” 三人并无异议。他们都对金兰城不熟，有人指引不走弯路当然最好。沈清秋便低一低头， 问： “ 小兄弟，你叫什么名字？ ” 那少年一挺胸膛道： “ 我叫杨一玄，是城中金字兵器铺的儿子。 ” 不会就是冒死去昭华寺报信求援的那个兵器铺商人吧？ 柳清歌见沈清秋一直打量那少年，问道： “ 你看什么？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 我看，这孩子能在你手底下走几招，心性也不错，两者都很难得，倒是个可 塑之才。 ” 柳清歌： “ 可塑也没用，我不收徒弟。麻烦。 ” 走进主城，行人也渐渐多了起来。可这个 “ 多 ” ，只是相对刚才的空无一人而言，一条街上 顶多三四个人影，而且都从头到脚埋在黑布里，行色匆匆，一如惊弓之鸟漏网之鱼。 金字兵器铺规模不小，在最宽阔的主干道上连占了四个店面，打通了连起来作一家用，而 且还有内院、内厅、地窖。 无尘大师就在地窖中。他躺在床上，被子盖住下身，一见苍穹山派的援军就 “ 阿弥陀佛 ” 起 来。沈清秋道： “ 大师，情势危急，别的就不多说了。这金兰城中盛行的究竟是什么瘟 疫？大师又为何入城不出，音讯全无？还有为何人人都要裹着黑布？ ” 无尘苦笑道： “ 沈仙师所问，其实都是一个问题。 ” 说着，他掀开了下身的被子。沈清秋一僵。 被子下面，只有一对大腿，膝盖以下，空空如也。本该有小腿的地方，全都消失了。 柳清歌冷声道： “ 谁干的？ ” 无尘摇头： “ 不是谁干的。 ” 沈清秋就纳闷了： “ 不是谁干的，难道还是它自己没的？ ” 谁知无尘点头道： “ 正是这双腿自己没有的。 ” 他膝盖上方的腿部还缠着黑布，无尘伸手，费力地想要解开，木清芳连忙相助。无尘道： “ 这东西可能会让诸位道友略感不适。 ” 黑布一层一层解开，看清里面包裹的东西之后，沈清秋呼吸顿了一顿。 大师您管这叫 “ 略感不适 ” ？！ 原本是他大腿的地方，已尽皆溃烂，皮肤坏死，腐肉横生。黑布松开后，恶臭阵阵。 沈清秋： “ 这就是金兰城的瘟疫？ ” 无尘道： “ 不错。此病初发，先是小面积出现红斑，短则三五天，长则半月，红斑会扩大 并腐烂。再过一月，溃烂至见骨。必须以黑布缠身，少见风光，方可延迟发作。 ” 难怪城里人人都把自己裹成黑木乃伊。 沈清秋道： “ 发作期有一月之久，可为什么那时候前去昭华寺报信的杨先生，却是瞬间化 为白骨？ ” 无尘脸显悲痛之色： “ 惭愧，老衲也是后来方知，染此病者，如果在金兰城内，则可以存 活一月左右。但如果染病之后，离开金兰城超过一定距离，就会加速发作。我两位师弟， 就是贸然出城返寺，当场发作。 ” 怪不得不能进，也不能出！ 柳清歌道： “ 发病源是什么？怎么传染？ ” 无尘只叹道： “ 老衲惭愧。此番入城，蹉跎多日，对这瘟疫也还一筹莫展，既不知病源何 在，也不知如何传染。甚至不知道它究竟会不会传染。 ” 木清芳愣道： “ 此话怎解？ ” 沈清秋若有所悟： “ 你们看那兵器铺家的儿子，他近身照顾无尘大师这么久，却周身不缠 一条黑布，可见皮肤完好，康健得很。如果说这的确是瘟疫，无尘大师却没传染给他，岂 不蹊跷。 ” 无尘道： “ 正是此意。累诸位身陷此地，老衲心中实在过意不去。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 大师本意是救人于水火，千万别这么说。 ” 他见木清芳凝神研究无尘腿上的溃 烂部位，如同一丝腐臭也闻不到，问道： “ 木师弟有什么发现？能配出治疗的方子吗？ ” 木清芳摇摇头： “ 这似乎不像疫病，倒像是 ……” 他看了看几人： “ 在下需要察看更多的病 人，才敢下定论。 ” 沈清秋出了地窖，见那兵器铺家的儿子又怒气冲冲扛着一柄长刀往回走，笑着问道： “ 少 东家，怎么啦？ ” 杨一玄气道： “ 又有人进城来了。那个什么什么花的人最没用，都是上赶着送死！ ” 估计是幻花宫又送援（ ren ）手（ tou ）的来了。沈清秋见他脸鼓得像个包子，有心逗弄： “ 小兄弟，我看你功夫不错，有人教吗？ ” 杨一玄不理他。沈清秋又道： “ 我告诉你，你去找今天把你打下水的那个哥哥。他厉害得 很，你跟他多打几回，比你跟谁学都有用。 ” 一听这话，杨一玄抛下沈清秋就跑。沈清秋给柳清歌找了个缠人的麻烦，心中大乐，走几 步转过街角，看到前方光景，止住脚步。 城中死气沉沉，家家户户大门紧闭，也有不少原先就无家可归的人找不到去处，聚集在街 头。以往大街车水马龙，人来人往，不敢抛头露面，可如今空荡荡的，他们也肆无忌惮了 ，支了口大铁锅，底下堆柴，腾腾烧水，有几人揪着不知道哪里偷来的鸡在那儿拔毛。个 个都裹在密不透风的黑布里，见到画风和他们格格不入的沈清秋，一点不惊讶，看他的眼 神就像看死人。毕竟这些天，再多威风凛凛进城来说要解救他们的修士都见过了。有用 吗？死得比他们还快！ 掌勺的敲敲铁锅： “ 汤好了！来盛了来盛了！ ” 不少躺在旁边捉虱子的流浪汉一咕噜爬起，端着碗凑上去。 这场瘟疫打乱了整座城市的生活节奏，这样自发组织的大锅饭其实真能救命。 一定要快些查清疫病根源。沈清秋暗暗下此决心，转身要走，迎面过来一个人，拄着根拐 杖，身形佝偻，手抖得碗都快掉了，似乎是个老太太。 他见状要让路，结果不知对方年老体弱还是饿得发昏，脚底一歪，撞到沈清秋身上。 沈清秋扶了她一把，那老太太声音含混道： “ 对不住 …… 对不住 …… 人老糊涂啦 ……” 说着 又急急越过他往前走，估计是怕菜汤抢没了。 沈清秋走出两步，突然顿住。 不对劲。 这老太太看上去跟风中残烛似的一吹就倒，可刚才撞上来身体的为什么感觉比成年男人还 沉重？！ 他猛一回头，那争着盛热菜汤的人群里，根本没看到刚才那 “ 老太太 ” 的人影。 左侧有一条花巷入口，沈清秋追了上去，刚好看到一个弯背如勾的影子在巷尾一闪而过。 雾草这速度比百米冲刺跨栏也不差了吧？！还 “ 老太太 ” ！刚才真瞎了眼了！ 沈清秋拔腿就追。虽说这老太太形象的确可疑，但没立即发现异常这能怪他吗，现在整座 金兰城里，所有人都是这种浑身黑布缩着走路的可疑形象！ 追赶途中，他忽然觉得手背有点痒，举起来一看。 这条手还真是多灾多难。当初被天锤长老刺满了窟窿眼的是它，现在受染开始长出红斑的 也是它！ 说起来当初手贱戳开《狂傲仙魔途》这本奇书的也是它。好想剁了这只手啊啊啊！！！ 这么一分神，沈清秋脚下慢了一步，又觉察头顶有人挟剑气袭来，折扇一展，准备随时飞 个风刀出去，喝道： “ 谁？！ ” 那人倏地从一旁屋檐上落地，两人打个照面，沈清秋脱口而出： “ 公仪萧？ ” 那青年立刻撤剑，惊大于喜： “ 沈前辈？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 是我。你怎么也来了？ ” 想起刚才杨一玄说又有幻花宫的人从暗河进城了，想 必就是公仪萧这一拨人，问道： “ 幻花宫派你带人入城查探？ ” 公仪萧道： “ 晚辈的确是受命入城调查，但 …… 带领者不是我。 ” 沈清秋奇了。公仪萧可是幻花宫老宫主最受宠的小弟子，在洛冰河出现之前普遍默认他为 下一代领导，老宫主独生爱女也倾心于他，但凡弟子辈有个什么事，那必须是他带队，除 了洛冰河能用男主光环吊打他，谁还能抢他位置？ 不过眼下来不及细想，沈清秋道： “ 一起追！ ” 公仪萧响亮地应了一声，两人齐齐跃出。 那佝偻身影闪进了一座三层楼台。这建筑站在外面都能感觉香粉扑鼻，台上花枝招展，看 来以往是勾栏一类的地方。只是如今早没了欢声笑语，莺歌燕舞，只有大门敞开，一楼大 厅一片森然。 两人屏气凝神，迈进门槛。 大厅里桌椅翻到，一片狼藉。沈清秋看了公仪萧一眼： “ 分头查。你看左边的雅间，我负 责右边。 ” 他用折扇推开最近那间的门。床上影影绰绰能看见躺了个人，他先是一提心，然后很快放 下来。 那只是一具白骨，身穿花色繁复的衫子，满头珠翠，躺的姿势很安详。大概是楼内的女子 ，心知死期已到，梳妆打扮，穿上了最好的衣衫，安睡赴死。连死亡也要用最美的姿态， 大概是女子的天性。沈清秋唏嘘一秒，退出房间，依然把门关好。 一连好几间里，都有正装的女子尸骨。看来这间勾栏几乎是全军覆没。沈清秋正要推开第 六间，从二楼传来响动和人声。 两人飞身上楼。沈清秋抢在前面，人还在楼梯上。忽然，有个青年温润的声音传来： “ 无 碍。 ” 虽说只有两个字，可一听到这个声音，沈清秋瞬间如遭雷击。手中折扇被他捏得发出咔嚓 一声。 一刹那，连呼吸都仿佛停止了。 他僵硬地卡在了楼梯上，可已经能看到二楼长廊尽头的雅阁了。一群幻花宫服色的弟子们 正簇拥着中心的一人。 那是个身穿玄衣、背负一把古朴长剑的青年，面如冠玉，两点沉潭寒星般的眸子，正漫不 经心地移了过来。 虽然长开了不少，气质也与以往大不相同，可这张随便哪个角度都能选作言情小说封面男 主的脸，沈清秋打死也不会认错！ 同时，一个已经封尘依旧的熟悉声音，伴着谷歌翻译般刻板的语调，在他脑子里连珠炮般 地炸开数条提示消息： 【您好。系统已成功激活。】 【通用激活码：洛冰河。】 【自我检测：总能源运行正常，状态良好。】 【休眠模式停用。标准模式启动。】 【更新包下载安装完毕】 等一下我勒个擦你还真的更新了？！ 【感谢您的再次使用。】 能退货吗？,"CHAPTER 32: MASTER AND DISCIPLE REUNITE PART 1 Shen Qingqiu suddenly sat straight up. Fuck fuck fuck, a floating corpse! I just finished saying “this water is so clear” and you gift me by drifting over a floating corpse; do you have to be so heavy-handed in your face- slapping?! Liu Qingge used the oar to hook that floating corpse and flip it over: it was actually another skeleton. They hadn’t noticed earlier because its entire body and head was swathed in black cloth, and it was also floating face-down. Shen Qingqiu asked, “Mu-shidi, do you know if this world has a kind of plague, that can make a person instantaneously decay into a skeleton?” Mu Qingfang shook his head. “I’ve never heard of one.” As they were moving against the current, they would be pushed unless they kept advancing; after staying still for so long, the little boat had already moved a distance backwards. Liu Qingge picked up the oar again, and after a moment, spoke. “There’s more ahead.” Sure enough, five or six more floating corpses drifted towards them from up ahead, one after another, all skeletons swathed in black cloth, just like the first. While Shen Qingqiu was deep in concentration, Liu Qingge suddenly stabbed the long oar into the nearby stone wall. The thin and brittle bamboo oar actually stuck straight into the solid, seamless stone. The boat was stabilized, fixed in place. Shen Qingqiu sensed something was wrong and shot to his feet. “Who is it?” A sound of hurried breathing came from the dark depths before them; the lantern at the prow of the ship faintly illuminated a human silhouette. Then, they heard a youth’s voice say, “Who are you? What are you doing sneaking around in this underground river?” Shen Qingqiu said, “I want to ask you the same thing.” Though he was standing on a broken-down little boat, with his teal robes and black hair, the longsword hanging at his waist, his every movement calm and composed, he still had quite a bit of an immortal’s demeanor. And Shen Qingqiu already had become experienced in acting cool; he was quite convincing in faking his own aesthetic. As expected, the youth had not expectedsomeone so pretentious-looking; he froze for a long moment, before shouting, “You should leave! No one is allowed into the city!” Liu Qingge humphed. “You? Who can you keep away?” The youth said, “There’s a plague in the city; if you don’t want to die, then get out!” Mu Qingfang said gently, “Young man, we are here precisely for that reason…” Seeing them refusing to leave, the youth yelled angrily, “Do you not understand human speech? Get out! Or else, I won’t be so polite!” Before he had finished, he attacked with a spear, ferocious like a tiger and quite intimidating. Liu Qingge let out a cold laugh, and pulled out the bamboo oar stuck in the wall. With a flick of the pole, the other was already sent flying into the water. Shen Qingqiu could hear that youth still yelling and cursing even while flailing about in the water, and asked, “Should we fish him out?” Liu Qingge: “He’s young and full of energy, no need. Let’s go.” And continued to row. The three exited the underground river, and the illegal boat drifted back into the darkness along with the current. The exit was at the city’s most overgrown pond, and not a single person was around. After the three walked towards the center of the city for a while, a set of footsteps suddenly chased up to them from behind. The bedraggled youth charged up to them and yelled, flustered and annoyed, “I told you not to enter the city! What use is it coming here!? So many people have already come, saying they were going to save us from the plague; what head monks and old Daoists, whatever Hua Palace, and in the end none of them are able to leave! You’re looking for death!” So this young man had ambushed them in the dark in their best interests. Shen Qingqiu said, “Then since we have already entered, what do you think we should do?” The youth said, “What else can you do? Follow me and don’t run around! I’ll take you to the head monk.” The three had no objections. None of them were familiar with Jin Lan city; of course it was best if there was a guide to stop them from taking the long road. Shen Qingqiu looked down and asked, “Young man, what is your name?” The youth puffed up his chest and said, “My name is Yang Yixuan, I’m the son of the owner of the Jin Zi weapons shop.” Could it have been that merchant who risked death to report to Zhao HuaTemple and seek assistance? Seeing Shen Qingqiu appraise the youth, Liu Qingge asked, “What are you looking at?” Shen Qingqiu: “In my eyes, this child can exchange a few blows with you and has a pretty good temperament; both are hard to find. He is a moldable talent.” Liu Qingge: “Moldable is useless, I don’t take disciples. Too bothersome.” After walking into the main part of the city, more and more pedestrians began to appear. But this “more” was only in comparison to the previous empty streets: at most, there were only three or four silhouettes per street, and all were cloaked in black cloth from head to toe, movements hasty, like birds startled by a bow or fish slipping through a net. The Jin Zi weapons shop was quite large; on the widest main road it occupied four storefronts in a row, all connected together into one store; it even had an inner courtyard, inner hall, and cellar. Master Wu Chen was in the cellar. He laid on the bed, a blanket covering his lower body, and as soon as he saw Cang Qiong Mountain Sect’s reinforcements, began to chant “Amitabha.” Shen Qingqiu said, “Master, the circumstances are urgent; no need to spend too long on other things. What is this plague raging through Jin Lan City? Why did you enter but never leave, without even a message? And why is everyone wrapped in black cloth?” Wu Chen forced a smile. “The answer to all of Master Shen’s questions is in fact one and the same.” Saying this, he lifted up the blanket covering his lower body. Shen Qingqiu froze. Underneath the blankets was only a pair of thighs: from the knees down, there was nothing. Where there should have been a pair of calves, everything had disappeared. Liu Qingge said coldly, “Who did this?” Wu Chen shook his head. “Not a who.” Shen Qingqiu was puzzled. “If not a who, then did they disappear on their own?” Unexpectedly, Wu Chen nodded his head. “This pair of legs really did disappear on their own.” His legs were still swathed in black cloth from the knees up. Wu Chen reached out, straining to unwrap them, and Mu Qingfang hurried to help. Wu Chen said, “This may make everyone feel a bit uncomfortable.”The black cloth was unwrapped layer by layer; after he saw what was wrapped inside, Shen Qingqiu’s breath paused. Great Master, you call this “a bit uncomfortable?!” The place where his thighs used to be had already completely festered, the skin necrotized, a mass of rotten flesh. After the black cloth was untied, a terrible stench came in waves. Shen Qingqiu: “This is Jin Lan City’s plague?” Wu Chen said, “Yes. When this disease first develops, red patches will appear in a small area for three to five days on the short side, or half a month on the long side, and the red patches will expand and fester. After another month, the rot will advance down to the bones. One must swathe oneself in black cloth and avoid exposure to the elements, in order to delay its progression.” No wonder everyone in the city had swathed themselves into black mummies. Shen Qingqiu said, “If the disease develops over a month’s time, why did Mister Yang, who went to notify Zhao Hua Temple, decay into a skeleton in an instant?” A sorrowful expression appeared on Wu Chen’s face. “I am ashamed to say, I only later discovered that the infected patients can survive for approximately a month as long as they stay within Jin Lan City; but if after they are infected, they go a certain distance away from Jin Lan City, the disease’s progression will accelerate. My two shidi, after they rashly tried to leave the city and return to the tempe, experienced this on the spot.” No wonder no one could enter, and no one could leave! Liu Qingge said, “What is the origin of the disease? How is it transmitted?” Wu Chen could only sigh. “I am ashamed. With this journey into the city, we squandered many days, and still have not made any progress towards a solution: we do not know its origin, nor its method of transmission. We do not even know if it can be transmitted.” Mu Qingfang was shocked. “What do you mean?” Shen Qingqiu had a realization. “See that weapon seller’s son: he has been closely taking care of Master Wu Chen for so long, but he has not a strip of black cloth on him: his skin is still intact, and he is quite healthy. If this truly is a plague, yet Master Wu Chen has not infected him, wouldn’t it be strange.” Wu Chen said, “Precisely this. I am truly apologetic to have caused everyone to be trapped here.”Shen Qingqiu said, “You only intended to save people from disaster, there is no need for apologies.” Seeing Mu Qingfang absorbed in investigating the festered parts of Wu Chen’s leg like he could not smell a hint of the stench, he asked, “Mu-shidi, have you made any discoveries? Can you create a medicine to treat it?” Mu Qingfang shook his head. “This does not seem like a plague, but rather like…” He looked at a few of the people around him. “I need to examine more patients before I can make a definite conclusion.” Shen Qingqiu exited the cellar, and saw that weapon seller’s son heading back full of rage, a long sword slung over his shoulder; he laughed and asked, “Young master, what’s happening?” Yang Yixuan huffed, “Someone entered the city again. Those people from the something something Hua are the most useless; they’re all rushing to their deaths!” Huan Hua Palace must have sent aid (extra victims). Seeing his face puffed up like a steamed bun, Shen Qingqiu felt like teasing him a bit. “Young man, your martial skills are quite good, did you have a teacher?” Yang Yixuan ignored him. Shen Qingqiu continued, “Let me tell you, you should go find that gege who tossed you into the water today. He’s very formidable; fighting a few rounds with him will be more effective than learning from anyone.” Hearing this, Yang Yixuan abandoned Shen Qingqiu and ran. Having found Liu Qingge a frustrating new problem, Shen Qingqiu was in a joyful mood; he walked a few steps and turned a corner, but seeing the scene before him, stopped in his path. The city was devoid of life, each door and gate shut tight; there were many who’d always been homeless; having nowhere to go, they could only gather in the street. Before, when carriages and horses had streamed through the streets, people coming and going, they had been afraid to show their faces, but now with it so empty, they became fearless: they’d set up a big iron pot, with firewood piled underneath, and were boiling a churning pot of water, with some were plucking the feathers off a chicken stolen from who-knows-where. Each person was wrapped in tightly bundled layers of black cloth, but upon seeing Shen Qingqiu, whose aura was entirely incompatible with theirs, they were not a bit shocked, and looked at him with the gaze of someone looking at a corpse. After all, these days, they had seen every kind of impressive-looking cultivator sweep into the city and claim they would save them. And were they any use? They diedeven faster than them! The cook rapped on the iron pot. “The soup is done! Come get your share!” Many of the drifters lying nearby picking at their lice rolled to their feet and gathered around, bowls in hand. This plague had disrupted the entire city’s daily life, so this spontaneous communal meal could really save some lives. They must discover the origin of the plague soon. Silently setting this resolution, Shen Qingqiu turned to go, and came to face a person who was walking towards him: they held a walking stick, their figure hunched over, the hand holding their bowl shaking so much it was about slip; seemingly an old lady. Seeing this, he moved to get out of the way, but the other must have been weak due to age or faint from hunger, and tripped and crashed into Shen Qingqiu. Shen Qingqiu helped her up; the old lady mumbled, “Apologies… apologies… I’m old and confused…” then quickly walked past him and away, probably afraid of all the soup being gone. Shen Qingqiu walked another two steps, then suddenly stopped. Something was off. That old lady looked like the faintest breeze would knock her over, but when her body crashed into him, why did it seem even heavier than that of an adult man’s?! He whipped his head back around: in that crowd of people jostling for bowls of hot soup, there was no sign of that “old lady” he had just seen. There was an opening into an alley to the left; Shen Qingqiu chased after into it, and just managed to catch a glimpse of a hunchbacked silhouette flash through the end of the alley. Fuck me, with this speed it wouldn’t lose to a runner doing the 100-meter hurdles?! What “old lady!” He must have been blind! Shen Qingqiu broke into a run and gave chase. Though this old lady was indeed suspicious, could you blame him for not realizing something was strange right away: right now, in all of Jin Lan City, everyone cut the same suspicious figure, walking around while hunched over and completely in black! Mid-chase, he suddenly felt an itch on the back of his hand, and raised it up to look. This hand really was plagued with misfortunes. It was this hand that hadbeen poked full of holes by that Elder Tianchui, and now it was also this hand that had gotten infected, growing red patches! Come to think of it, it had also been this hand which had first clicked on this stupid novel Proud Immortal Demon Way. If only he could chop off this hand ahhhh!!! With this brief distraction, Shen Qingqiu slowed a step. Suddenly, he felt someone attack with a blast of sword energy from overhead. With a flick of his fan, he prepared to return fire with a blade of wind, and yelled, “Who is it?!” The person suddenly jumped from a nearby roof to the ground; the two looked at each other, and Shen Qingqiu let slip a, “Gongyi Xiao?” The youth immediately lowered his sword and responded in surprised joy. “Senior Shen?” Shen Qingqiu replied, “It’s me. Why are you here too?” Remembering that Yang Yixuan said before that more of Huan Hua Palace’s people had entered the city through the underground lake; it must have been the party that Gongyi Xiao had come with. He asked, “Huan Hua Palace sent you to take an exploratory party into the city?” Gongyi Xiao replied, “Indeed, this junior was ordered to investigate the city, but… the leader is not me.” Shen Qingqiu thought this curious. Gongyi Xiao was the favorite disciple of Huan Hua Palace’s Old Palace Master. Before Luo Binghe had appeared, everyone tacitly agreed that he would be the next leader, even the Old Palace Master’s beloved only daughter adored him. Whenever the disciples’ generation did anything, he would always be the leader; other than Luo Binghe, who could stomp him using his protagonist halo, who else could steal his position? But at the moment, there was no time for him to consider. Shen Qingqiu said, “Let’s chase together!” Gongyi Xiao gave him a resounding agreement, and the two leapt forwards side by side. The hunchbacked figure flashed into a three-story building. Even while standing outside a haze of fragrant powder assailed the nose, and covered in beautiful decorations, it must have been some sort of brothel. But now, there were no joyful noises or laughing conversation, no signs or sounds of prosperity, only a gate wide-open, the main hall dreary and oppressive. Holding their breaths and on full alert, the two stepped over the threshold. The chairs and tables in the main hall were overturned, everything a scattered mess. Shen Qingqiu gave Gongyi Xiao a look. “Split up and search.You check the private rooms on the left, I’ll take the right.” He used his fan to push open the nearest door. He could see the indistinct form of a person lying on the bed, and initially raised his guard, but lowered it soon after. It was only a skeleton wearing a colorful and adorned jacket, its head covered in pearls and jade, lying in a serene position. It was probably one of the women of this establishment who, knowing her time had come, had dressed and groomed herself, wore her best clothes, and gone to meet her death in sleep. Insisting on being the most beautiful even in death, was probably the innate nature of women. Shen Qingqiu sighed in sorrow, backed out of the room, and shut the door. Many rooms in a row all contained the corpses of women in formal dress. It seemed like this brothel had practically all been wiped out. As Shen Qingqiu was about to push open the sixth room, he heard the sound of movement and human voices from the second floor. The two flew up the stairs. Shen Qingqiu stole to the front; they were still on the stairs. Suddenly, he heard the gentle voice of a youth. “It’s no trouble.” Though it was only three words, hearing as soon as he heard this voice, it was as if Shen Qingqiu had immediately been struck by a bolt of lightning. The fan in his hand cracked under the force of his grip. In an instant, even his breath had stopped. He was frozen on the steps, but he could already see into the private room at the end of the second floor corridor. A group of disciples dressed in Huan Hua Palace’s uniform colors were crowding around a person in the center. It was a youth wearing black, shouldering a simple and unadorned longsword, complexion as clear as jade, eyes like two deep pools of cold starlight, currently nonchalantly moving towards him. Though he had grown up quite a bit and his aura was quite a bit different than before, Shen Qingqiu could never mistake that face, that no matter the angle could be on the cover of a romance novel! At the same time, a familiar voice which had long been gathering dust, in a Google Translate-like mechanical tone, began to spout off a number of messages in his head like a barrage of gunfire: Hello.

好死不死他还问了一句： “ 沈前辈？为何要忽然后退？ ” …… 你也太不会看场合看时间看脸色说话了公仪公子！ 身后 , 一个低且柔和的声音传来： “ 师尊？ ” 沈清秋僵着脖子 , 缓缓转头。 只是一个动作，可他现在做来 , 觉得项上人头有几千斤重。洛冰河那张堪称完美的脸孔， 这时候在他眼里 , 比什么都要恐怖。 更恐怖的是，现在这张脸上的表情，不是冷若冰霜，不是笑里藏刀，而是一种酥到人骨子 里去的温柔可亲。 我去你不要这样啊好吓人！ 洛冰河笑得越柔情似水，对手下场越是魂殒身碎，这点绝对不是开玩笑的。 沈清秋整个人卡在楼梯口，不上不下，背脊起了一层寒毛。 洛冰河缓缓走近，轻声道： “ 果真是师尊。 ” 他声音轻飘飘的，可从他唇齿间吐露的每一个字，就像他每走一步时阁楼上的足音，让沈 清秋心也跟玩儿一次高空蹦极加冰桶挑战。 虎头铡已经架在了脖子上，不上也得上！沈清秋定一定神，硬着头皮，右手捏着扇骨青筋 隐隐突显，左手一甩青衫下摆，抬脚一步，终于踏上了二楼。 才一站上去，他就要泪奔了。 洛冰河当年参加仙盟大会的时候，还是和他平视的，而现在，沈清秋要稍微抬起头，才能 和他对视了，光从气势上就矮了一大截！ 好在沈清秋装 b 多年，经验丰富，不管内里如何，至少镇定自若的表情已经长在了脸皮的 肉上。半晌，他从喉咙里艰涩地挤出一句： “…… 这究竟是怎么回事。 ” 洛冰河微微一笑，似乎并不打算回答。 反倒是他身后一群幻花宫的弟子们，呼啦一下堵了上来。 沈清秋这才发现，这些弟子的态度很不对头。 沈清秋早年也算横扫过大江南北的宗师级人物，且不提别派晚辈，就算是平辈见了，也鲜 少有不刻意恭迎的。然而，这些幻花宫弟子却似乎对他满满的都是敌意，个个眼神不善， 有的已经亮了兵器。加上洛冰河不说话站在那里，好好一群名门正派的青少年，看上去就 像一群准备立刻蜂拥而上为老大拼命的马仔、或者随时要去杀人放火的魔界走狗 …… 搞错没有啊少年们，不要上赶着给人当保镖行不行，你们后面那个要你保护吗？！他不来 害人就不错了，真正需要保护的人是我啊是我啊！ 公仪萧见气氛不对， □□ 中间来，低声斥道： “ 把剑收起来，成何体统！ ” 众人有所收敛，拔了剑的都不情不愿插回鞘中，但对沈清秋的敌意却没下去几分。 怪不得。怪不得这次带队的不是公仪萧。要是在以前，最受器重的弟子一发话，这些同门 哪敢有接着摆脸色的。可现在有黑化后洗脑功夫一流的洛冰河在，他就是绝对的中心。一 万年也轮不上别人做领导。 可沈清秋都快脑震荡了，还是想不明白，洛冰河到底什么时候混进幻花宫的？按原作进度 那都是起码两年之后的事情！ 双方僵立一阵，忽然，旁边走出来一名鹅黄色衫子的娟秀少女，垂泪道： “ 你们现在还有 心思这样，洛公子他 …… 洛公子他都被那奸人害了，就不能先想想法子么！ ” 沈清秋才注意到，角落里倒了一条人形，正是刚才那名假老太太。 他再去看洛冰河，只见后者衣袖似乎被剑气削去一截，露出小半段手腕。洛冰河肤色甚白 ，显得手腕上几点红斑尤其刺眼。 他下意识脱口而出： “ 你被传染了？ ” 洛冰河看他一眼，摇头诚恳道： “ 不碍事。大家没事就好。 ” 这般无私又体贴的模样，一瞬间，沈清秋险些就要以为眼前这个，还是过往那只窝在自己 膝盖下咩咩叫、爱吃草的小绵羊了。 奈何，幻花宫的弟子们真是很能破他冷水，阴阳怪气道： “ 洛公子染上这瘟疫了，沈前辈 心里估计高兴极了吧？ ” …… 沈清秋开始认真思考自己到底在哪儿什么时候的罪过整个幻花宫。 公仪萧看看沈清秋脸色，十分尴尬，回头斥责道： “ 都给我住口！ ” 沈清秋一脸淡漠。作为成名多年的长辈，总不至于跟被男主洗脑的小青年纠缠。他只垂下 了手，袖子自然把刚才碰到那假老太太后长出红斑的手背遮住了。 开口的那名长了半张脸小麻子的弟子挨了训，悻悻然闭嘴，仍一脸不服气。秦婉约凄然道 ：“ 都是我们不好。刚才要不是为保护我们，洛公子你也不会 ……” 沈清秋对城中流行的东西大概是什么已经有个推测了，他真想拿个大喇叭在她耳边吼：少 女你醒醒！那根本不是瘟疫！ 沈清秋敢用他那些年追完两千多万字连载的青春和蛋疼保证：第一！这东西对洛冰河这个 天魔混血而言多半就跟生理盐水或者葡萄糖一样不痛不痒！ 第二！如果洛冰河被别人拖了后腿，或者为了救谁受了伤，不用考虑，那绝对是他故意 的！知不知道什么是刷形象正面值和好感度的最快途径？ 沈清秋看不下去幻花宫那边一派哀恸欲绝的气氛了。当然，他更受不了的是和洛冰河默默 对视、好像都在等着对方先开口的感觉。 他硬着头皮准备干点正事，目不斜视，走到那假老太太的尸体边，拔出修雅剑，嗤嗤几下 ，把黑布划成碎片，露出里面的身体。 果然。 这“ 人 ” 单看起来，相貌普通，辨别不出男女。但这不是重点。 骇人的重点在于，它通体肤色猩红，就像从头到脚都被扔滚水里煮熟透到心了，躯体却完 好，并未被煮烂。 沈清秋道： “ 是撒种人。 ” 撒种人，是魔族的一种职业。通常来说，沈清秋理解为魔界的农夫、农场主、或者种饲料 的批发商。 由于地理和种族等原因，魔界的许多生物，包括部分口味略重的魔族人士，都有比较奇特 的生理需求。具体来说，就是喜欢吃腐烂的东西，烂的越臭越好，爬了蛆的更是绝品美味 ，营养丰富。 但是哪来那么多腐烂的东西？ 撒种人的作用就在于此了。 凡是他们靠近或触碰过的非魔族 * 生物，都会在短期内出现肢体溃烂情况。魔界一度流行 过这样的庄园大锅饭：庄园主从人界一次性抓取上百活人，关牲口一样关到一个地方，放 撒种人进去。不出七天，等到烂得差不多的时候，这个时候，就可以打开门了。你可以选 择把人放出来吃，或者自己走进去吃。 这种奇葩的饮食习惯非常恶心。但是幸好，上古天魔一系，属于魔族最优雅、最传统的那 一支血脉，相当于魔界古老的贵族，各方面 b 格都不是平常魔界公民能比拟的，与这种猎 奇的口味无缘。不然，就算洛冰河长再帅挂再逆天恐怕也扛不住这样生理和心理都不能接 受的奇葩设定，想想吧，妹子们和他接吻的话得有多心塞哈哈哈！ 由于这种职业过分反人类，激起了当年人界修士们的滔天愤怒，展开了对撒种人的剿杀， 甚至不少无名英雄冒着被腐化的危险，与之同归于尽。不出十年，撒种人就几乎灭绝踪迹 ，连魔界都很难见到了，寻常修士闻所未闻，也是很正常的。沈清秋闲得没事就拿清静峰 上乱七八糟的陈年老书当志怪小说看，倒都是清楚。 他明明做出了很有建树性的判断，可惜，并没被重视。只有秦婉约客客气气道： “ 前辈所 言之事，洛公子早就猜到了，刚才，他已经对我们详细告知了撒种人相关。 ” 说完，跟着 四周一片幻花宫弟子一齐用倾慕憧憬的目光仰视洛冰河，仿佛他脸上正金光万丈。 出现了！这难道就是传说中 “ 无论男主说什么，旁人都会从话语中感受到对自己智商和阅 历上的绝对碾压 ” 的智计光环！ 洛冰河看向沈清秋，柔声道： “ 我所知事物，都是师尊教的 ” …… 可怕的是，沈清秋真的感觉他那张脸自带柔光！ 妈蛋。终于到了反派连 b 格都不让刷了、只给男主一个人出风头的这一天了吗 [ 手动拜拜 ] 沈清秋实在没办法在这种诡异的气氛中蹉跎人生下去了。照理，撒种人是幻花宫杀死的， 尸体处置权也在他们，沈清秋道： “ 既然如此，这具尸体可否借来一观。木师弟说不定会 有所发现，也好尽早研制出抵御疫情的方法。 ” 洛冰河点头道： “ 一切听师尊的。随后弟子就将尸身送到。 ” 沈清秋被他一口一个师尊叫得寒毛倒竖。他总算深切体会到原作面对洛冰河这种笑里藏刀 的人的心情了，因为根本不知道洛冰河到底想干什么！ 抽身拂袖，说走就走。出了这间废楼，沈清秋还处于毁灭性打击状态，走路都晕头转向， 脚底生歪风。公仪萧追上来，见沈清秋脸色苍白，神情恍惚，忐忑道： “ 沈前辈，十分抱 歉。其实我一直知晓，但家师有命，洛公子在幻花宫的事必须严格保密，不得外传，违者 逐出，所以不敢如实相告。 ” 沈清秋： “ 我只问你，他是怎么到那你们那边去的？ ” 公仪萧道： “ 是秦师妹，去年在洛川边救起了重伤昏迷的洛公子。 ” 去年。短短一年就把公仪萧从心腹地位上踹了下来，看来洛冰河入侵幻花宫不仅比原作时 间线提前了，连效率都提高了。顺便公仪萧果然就是个被男主不断从各种位置第一名上踹 下来的炮灰命！ 沈清秋道： “ 他既然被你们救了，为何没回苍穹山去？ ” 公仪萧留神着沈清秋的脸色，小心翼翼道： “ 被救治醒来之后，洛公子似乎，不愿提及往 事，告别时也吐露 …… 不会回苍穹山派，希望幻花宫能对他行踪保密，似乎打算浪迹天 涯。家师十分喜欢他，便继续挽留他，虽然并不以师徒相称，但待他种种，已经与亲传弟 子并无二样。 ” 原来如此。 洛冰河这种表现，正是标准的一朵饱受 □□ 、又默默忍受的小白花。人们很容易就会猜测 ，好好的为什么不肯回去呢？没准儿是是苍穹山派、尤其是沈清秋对不起他，当初仙盟大 会误传死讯里面，也必然有不可说的辛秘。 怪不得刚才幻花宫弟子们都对他是敌视态度。洛冰河洗脑的功夫可不是盖的，看看刚才他 们俨然以他马首是瞻的状态，就知道洛冰河现在宫内地位如何了。 一个 a 派的弟子到 b 派去走了一趟， b 派从高层到底层就全都哭着喊着要他留下来并且掖着 藏着不让别派知道  多么不科学不合常理的事情。可是这种事情在男主光环的照耀之下 ，完全符合逻辑！ 沈清秋沉默不语，公仪萧以为他是伤心失望，爱徒未死，却宁可流连在外也不肯回去见他 ，道： “ 沈前辈不必太过在意，洛公子也许只是一时有什么心结还未解开。之前他从不离 开幻花宫范围，这次却主动要求前来，可见已有所转机。不过，师弟师妹们 …… 咳，在这 件事上，对前辈有所误会，希望您不要与他们计较。 ” 沈清秋心塞锁大江。 多年辛辛苦苦刷的正面威望，果然还是经不住男主想黑就黑，黑的漂亮。 不对！其实这根本不算黑啊。因为他一点都不冤枉，他的确把人家踹无间深渊里去了没 错！ 简直找不到为自己辩解开脱的理由！ 沈清秋道： “ 那你呢？你为什么没误会？ ” 公仪萧微怔，立刻道： “ 虽然不知当初在绝地谷中，到底发生了什么，可我相信，前辈绝 不是会残害弟子之人。 ” 好吧，让我来告诉你为什么 …… 因为你跟我都是站在男主对立面的炮灰，所以更能理解和 同情彼此的处境。 后面幻花宫一行人也跟了上来，沈清秋不经意回头一瞥，只见洛冰河正看着这边。他抱手 而立，冷眼旁观。 沈清秋现在见了他，感觉自己心脏娇弱了不少，时常犹如一叶扁舟陷于惊涛骇浪、骤风暴 雨。比如现在，虽然洛冰河离他的距离并不近，面上也保持着得体的微笑，可那一对黑漆 漆的眼睛泠泠的，穿透力极强，看得沈清秋忽然心里一寒。 大哥，大爷！你又怎么了  俩炮灰说个话抱个团互暖一下也得罪你了？！ 刚到金字兵器铺门口，就听里面吵得几乎要把房顶掀起。这都是柳清歌干的好事。他负责 苦力，分头之后就出去给木清芳抓实验对象。城中人心惶惶，没有一个人愿意配合，这时 也顾不了那么多，只能用武力解决问题了。更何况，柳清歌根本不是有耐心爱讲道理的 人。他的作风十分符合百战峰传统，直接出门一趟，顺手一抓就抓来十几个彪形大汉，绑 在大堂后的锻造台旁。那里现在已经成为木清芳的研究场所试验台。一群大男人，叫骂啼 哭之声，居然不输妇人。 沈清秋到地下库藏中，把方才一连串变故与其他人说明了。自己受染之事先暂且压下不 提。 无尘大师又是一阵阿弥陀佛： “ 多亏苍穹山各位道友，事情终于有了进展。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 恐怕没这么简单。受染者之间，是不能相互传染的，而清静峰上古籍中所记 载的，撒种人最大的一次撒种范围，只有三百余人。如果是整座城市这么大的感染范围， 撒种人肯定不止一个。 ” 柳清歌手放到剑柄上，站了起来。沈清秋知道他是行动派，说走就走，现在就要出去找别 的撒种人了，忙道： “ 慢着！我还有一件事要说。 ” 木清芳： “ 师兄请讲？ ” 沈清秋不知怎么开口，踟蹰片刻才道： “ 洛冰河回来了。 ” 众人反应并不大。本来，三人之中，无尘大师昭华寺的，不知道洛冰河是谁，木清芳除医 道药理外鲜少关心其他，也就柳清歌一个皱了皱眉，愕然道： “ 你那徒弟？他不是在仙盟 大会死于魔族之手了？ ” 沈清秋越发觉得难以解释： “…… 没死成。活着回来了。哎。 ” 他烦恼道： “ 你我还是先去 巡城。这话回来再细说。 ” 木清芳道： “ 也好。早一些处理完剩余的撒种人，少一点生灵涂炭。我也该去看一看那些 病人了。 ” 他一说，沈清秋就想起来，木清芳随身必备的那套银光雪亮的手术用具，刀针俱全，一字 摊开摆出来，仿佛法医验尸现场，还有无限空间里成千上百个贴着不同标签的瓶瓶罐罐， 标签上的字样和说明就像瓶罐里东西的味道和功效一样，令人闻之色变，见之丧胆。估计 上面锻造台旁边那群大汉待会儿真的会把房顶掀翻。 沈清秋干笑一声，正要随柳清歌出地窖，突然间，毫无征兆的，心跳声好像陡然放大数百 倍，动作也跟着滞了一滞。 柳清歌觉察异状，立刻问道： “ 怎么了？ ” 沈清秋没回答，右手试着想甩个灵力暴击，微弱的灵流断断续续从之间蹿过，没引起一丝 火花。 我靠在这种紧要关头发作，你玩儿我吧？！ 木清芳低声道： “‘ 无可解 ’ 。 ” 柳清歌按了他脉门，停顿一瞬，果断把他按回去： “ 坐着。等。 ” 等什么？！等洛冰河找上门吗？！沈清秋霍然站起： “ 我跟你出去。 ” 柳清歌： “ 不要碍事。 ” 大大你可是一夫当关万夫莫开的百战峰主人！带我一个飞能碍什么事！ 木清芳道： “ 沈师兄你今天吃药了吗？ ” 沈清秋真想仰天长叫： “ 我没有放弃治疗！！！ ” 我这个月明明有按时吃药！也有按时请柳巨巨帮忙运功打通灵脉！到底为什么会莫名其妙 发作，简直晴天霹雳一头雾水！ 这时，系统忽然好死不死提示来了：【主角爽度 +100 】 你滚！ 你这是 “ 沈清秋倒霉，男主就很爽 ” 的意思吗？！ 敢不敢不要这么含糊其辞，有种的系统就说清楚为什么忽然加分！ 木清芳又道： “ 沈师兄千万不要逞强。柳师兄也是为你好。发作期间勉力奔波运功，损害 极大。你留在此地休整，我去制药，待柳师兄回来，再助你打通灵脉。 ” 沈清秋站起来三次，都被柳清歌按回去，木清芳的语气又像在教育熊孩子，无奈道： “ 那 好。柳师弟你听我说，撒种人通体皮肤猩红，感染力极强，遇到形似的可疑对象不要贸然 上前，远距离攻击。回来时一定来一趟我房间，我有很重要的话同你商量。 ” 最后一句最重要，沈清秋刻意咬字加重。 养兵千日用在一时，柳大大你千万要罩着我啊！ 柳木二人离开地窖后，无尘凝思道： “ 沈仙师，你不觉得奇怪？魔界沉寂已久，而近些年 来，竟有卷土重来之势。上次仙盟大会，不少罕有魔物重出人世。而此次金兰城更是出现 了绝迹百年的撒种人，老衲担忧，这 …… 恐怕不是什么好兆头。 ” 岂止，而且这些撒种人明显是加强板。最初的撒种人，绝对没有规定感染者与它们距离不 能超过多远。沈清秋深有同感： “ 大师所顾虑者，也正是我不能放心的。 ” 是啊。洛冰河本来应该在无间深渊底下再呆两年的，居然提前出狱了。这能是特么的好兆 头吗！ 无尘大师受染之后，功体大损，精力消耗极大，坐谈不久就生出倦意，沈清秋便安置他躺 下，尽量悄声退出地窖。无尘藏在地窖，是因为不能见光见风，沈清秋的房间却在兵器铺 内堂二层。柳清歌还未回来，这时候想睡也睡不着，他便坐在桌子旁发呆。一会儿想以前 跟在自己后面整天叫师尊的小绵羊洛冰河，一会儿想刚才那个隔了一层一样、让人浑身上 下都不自在的黑莲花洛冰河，恨不得拔光自己头发才好。 呆了一会儿，有人敲了两下门。不轻不重。 沈清秋从桌边霍然站起： “ 柳师弟？等你大半夜了，快进来！ ” 房门突然向两边猛地掀开。 洛冰河站在房门口，背靠无边黑暗，负手而立，唇角微翘，眼底却似有寒潭千尺。 他弯弯眯起眼睛，道： “ 师尊，你好啊。 ”","CHAPTER 33: MASTER AND DISCIPLE REUNITE PART 2 Shen Qingqiu stared at that young man who was both familiar yet also seemingly not; his four limbs had gone stiff, and his throat dry. Wasn’t his grand comeback supposed to be after five years? Wasn’t Luo Binghe currently supposed to be inside an endless hell, carving his way through thorns, studying the blade and wiping out monsters? Why has it moved up by two years! Why were you so impatient! If you rush your training there won’t be any quality guarantees, Bingge! Shen Qingqiu had the urge to turn around and rush down the stairs, rush out of Jin Lan City, rush out of this goddamn world, but after backing up a step, was blocked completely by Gongyi Xiao, who just had to ask, “Senior Shen? Why did you suddenly back up?” … You really can’t read the atmosphere, understand timing, or read faces before speaking at all, Young Lord Gongyi! A seemingly gentle voice came from behind him. “Shizun?” Neck stiff, Shen Qingqiu slowly turned his head. It was only a simple action, but right now to him, it felt like his head weighed several thousands pounds. At this moment and in his eyes, that perfect face of Luo Binghe’s was scarier than anything else. The most frightening thing was, the expression on that face now, was not icy-cold, nor a poisonous smile, but a kind and gentle one that could cause a person’s ribs to collapse with terror. Fuck you don’t act like this it’s terrifying! The more tender and soft Luo Binghe’s smile was, the more thoroughly his opponent’s soul and body would be destroyed; this part was absolutely not a joke. Shen Qingqiu’s entire body was stuck at the top of the stairs, unable to ascend or descend, fine hair rose all over his back. Luo Binghe slowly walked closer, and softly said, “It really is Shizun.” His voice was soft and light, but every word that emerged from between his teeth, like the sound of footfall every time he took a step, sent Shen Qingqiu’s heart through a high-altitude bungee jump combined with an ice- bucket challenge.The guillotine blade1 was already over his neck; he had no choice but to face it! Shen Qingqiu gathered his composure and steeled himself; his right clutched at the slats of his fan, the veins bulging faintly, while his left swept up the hem of his teal robes, and he raised his foot and took a step, finally making it onto the second floor. He’d only just started standing there, and he was already about to burst into tears. Back in the year Luo Binghe had participated in the Immortal Alliance Conference, their eyes had been level with each other, but now, Shen Qingqiu had to slightly lift his head, in order to look him face to face; he’d already taken a huge amount of damage from just force of presence alone! Fortunately Shen Qingqiu had been acting cool for years, and had plenty of experience; no matter how terrified and turbulent he was on the inside, at least his composed and unperturbed expression was already baked onto his face. After a long while, he painfully squeezed out a line from within his throat. “… What exactly is going on here.” Luo Binghe gave a smile, like he had no intention of answering. Unexpectedly, it was the group of Huan Hua disciples behind him that flocked forwards. Only now did Shen Qingqiu realize that these disciples’ attitudes were not normal. In his early years Shen Qingqiu had also been someone on the level of a great and revered scholar, his name had swept all over the land, and even when not talking about juniors from other sects, only considering meetings with those from the same generation, it was rare for someone to deliberately refuse to show respect. Yet these Huan Hua Palace disciples seemed to be full of hostility towards him: their gazes were full of ill intentions, with some having already drawn their weapons. Adding on how Luo Binghe was standing there, completely composed, while a group of perfectly fine youths from a famous righteous sect, looked like a group of henchmen ready to rush forward and stake their lives for their boss, or demonic lackeys ready to kill and burn… Don’t you have it wrong, young men; don’t be in such a hurry to be someone’s bodyguard, okay; like the person behind you needs your protection?! That he’s not harming anyone is already pretty good; the person who really needs protection is me, me! Seeing the atmosphere was off, Gongyi Xiao inserted himself betweenthem and reprimanded them quietly, “Put your swords away; what sort of manners are those!” Everyone then showed some restraint: the ones who’d drawn their swords grudgingly sheathed them, but their hostility towards Shen Qingqiu didn’t decrease. No wonder. No wonder the one who led the party this time, was not Gongyi Xiao. If this had been the past, and the most highly regarded disciple had spoken, none of these fellow disciples would dare show displeasure. But now Luo Binghe was here, who post-blackening had first-rate brainwashing skills, so everything would definitely revolve around him. Even if ten-thousand years passed, no one else could become the leader. But even though Shen Qingqiu felt like he was about to have a concussion, he still couldn’t figure out when exactly Luo Binghe infiltrated Huan Hua Palace? According to the original work’s progression, that should have happened at least two years later! Both sides stood stiffly for a while, when suddenly a graceful young lady dressed in a light yellow outer robe emerged from the sidelines, and said while shedding tears, “You still have the mood for this; Luo-shixiong he… Luo- shixiong was harmed by that scoundrel; can’t you think up a way to help him first!” Only now did Shen Qingqiu notice that in the corner was a humanoid figure: and it was that fake old lady from just then. He looked at Luo Binghe again, and saw that the latter’s sleeve looked like a portion had been shaved away by sword energy, exposing a small section of his wrist. Luo Binghe’s skin was very fair, so the couple of red spots on his wrist were especially stark. He instinctively let slip a line. “You were infected?” Luo Binghe gave him a glance, then shook his head. “Only a small wound. As long as everyone is safe.” With this type of selfless and considerate behaviour; for a moment, Shen Qingqiu could almost believe that the one before his eyes, was still that bleating, grass-loving little sheep who would huddle beneath his knees. Despite it all, the Huan Hua Palace disciples really were good at splashing cold water on him, and bizarrely said, tone cold, “Isn’t this good; I suppose Senior Shen’s heart is probably incredibly happy that Luo-shixiong was infected by this plague, right?” Shen Qingqiu was starting to seriously wonder exactly when he’d offended the entire Huan Hua Palace.Gongyi Xiao looked at Shen Qingqiu’s expression, and felt incredibly embarrassed; he turned back and quietly scolded, “You all shut up.” As a long-famous senior, he would never sink so low as to squabble with insignificant youths who’d been brainwashed by the male lead. With an indifferent expression, Shen Qingqiu dropped his hand, the sleeve naturally covering up the back of it, which had broken out into red spots after bumping into that fake old lady just now. The disciple who’d spoken had pockmarks covering half his face; after being scolded he resentfully closed his mouth, his entire face full of dissatisfaction. Qin Wanyue then said, “It’s all our fault. If it hadn’t been for you protecting us, Luo-shixiong wouldn’t have…” Shen Qingqiu already had a rough guess on what the thing spreading through the city was; he could guarantee it on the youth and frustrations he’d wasted from following the two-million-word-plus serialization for years: first, to a mixed-heritage heavenly demon like Luo Binghe, this thing was approximately the same as saline water or glucose, completely harmless, and actually might have health benefits instead! Second, if Luo Binghe let others drag him down, or was injured for others; no thought was needed; that was definitely planned by him! Don’t you know what’s the fastest way to foster a righteous image and favorable feelings? Shen Qingqiu couldn’t stand to keep watching the atmosphere of heartbroken grief surrounding Huan Hua Palace’s party. Of course, what he couldn’t stand even more was having a silent staredown with Luo Binghe, like both were waiting for each other to speak first. He steeled himself, preparing to do a bit of what he was supposed to; without a sideways glance, he walked to that fake old lady’s corpse and drew Xiu Ya, and with several slashes, shredded the black cloth into pieces, revealing the body inside. As expected. At a glance, this “person’s” appearance was ordinary, and you couldn’t tell if it was male or female. But that wasn’t the main point. The terrifying main point was, its entire body’s skin was scarlet, like the whole thing had been thrown into boiling water and cooked through, yet the carcass was whole, and not cooked to mush. Shen Qingqiu said, “A sower.” Sowers were a type of profession among the demons. To put it mundanely, from Shen Qingqiu’s understanding they were the Demon Realm’s equivalent offarmers, farm owners, or general food distributors. The reason why the were equivalent, was because many of the Demon Realm’s creatures, including a portion of the demonic people who tended towards hardcore tastes, all had a peculiar biolological need. To say it concretely, they liked to eat rotten things, the more rotten and putrid the better; those crawling with bugs were even more of an exquisite delicacy, and abundant with nourishment. But where could one get so many rotten things? This was the purpose of the sowers. Every non-demonic organism that they touched, and purposely sowed onto, after a short period of time, their bodies would start to fester. Once this type of massive communal meal was popular on noble estates in the Demon Realm: the estate lord would capture more than a hundred living people, and like corralling cattle, would corral them somewhere, then put sowers inside. Within seven days, once they’d rotted enough, the doors could be opened. You could either let the people out and eat them that way, or walk in yourself and eat inside. This type of unique2 dining custom was extremely disgusting. But of course, the ancient heavenly demon lineage Luo Binghe belonged to, were the most elegant of the demons, their bloodline most tradition, and were equivalent to the Demon Realm’s old nobility; their number of B-points couldn’t be compared to the average demon commoner’s, and so they had no part in these novelty-seeking tastes. Otherwise, no matter how handsome or heaven- upsettingly overpowered Luo Binghe was, he feared that the girls wouldn’t be able to overcome the physiologically and psychologically taxing challenge of their world views that this bizarre2 setting was; else think about it, how suffocating would kissing him feel, hahaha! Since this kind of profession was grossly anti-human, it incited the overflowing rage of many Human Realm cultivators, and so they launched a campaign to eradicate the sowers, to the point that quite a few nameless heroes risked infection, and perished with them. After less than ten years, the sowers had gone almost completely extinct, and had become rare even within the Demon Realm, so it was normal for young disciples and ordinary cultivators to have never heard of them. When idle with nothing to do, Shen Qingqiu would take Qing Jing Peak’s aged, disarrayed texts and read them as supernatural novels, so he understood well. Unfortunately, this contributing conclusion he’d come up with all byhimself went unappreciated. Qin Wanyue politely said, “So Senior also knew about the demonic abominations that are sowers; Luo-shixiong had long guessed their identity; just now, he’d also told us all about them in detail.” After speaking, together with all the Huan Hua disciples around them, she directed an adoring, longing gaze at Luo Binghe, as if his face was emitting thousands of rays of golden light. It’s here! Could this be the legendary, “no matter what the male lead says, everyone else would feel their own IQ and knowledge being absolutely crushed by his words,” protagonist’s halo of wisdom?! Luo Binghe looked towards Shen Qingqiu, and smiled. “Everything I know was taught by Shizun.” … The most terrifying thing was, Shen Qingqiu really felt that his face really did carry a soft glow! Shen Qingqiu really did not want to waste time remaining in this eerie atmosphere. Since Huan Hua Palace had killed the sowers, naturally the right to take care of the corpse was also theirs; Shen Qingqiu said, “If that’s the case, may we borrow this corpse and take a look? It’s possible Mu-shidi may discover something, and can develop a medicine that will curb the epidemic as early as possible. “ Luo Binghe nodded and said, “Everything will be as Shizun says. Afterwards this disciple will deliver the corpse.” That one call of “Shizun” made all of Shen Qingqiu’s hair stand on end. He finally could deeply understand how the people in the original work felt when facing this dagger-concealing smile of Luo Binghe’s; he pulled himself away and flicked aside his sleeves, then left without a second word. After exiting that abandoned building, Shen Qingqiu was still in a state of devastated psychological shock: his head swam as he walked, his steps unsteady. Gongyi Xiao chased after him, and seeing that Shen Qingqiu’s face was pale, his expression distracted, nervously said, “Senior Shen, I greatly apologize. In truth, I’d always known about Luo-shixiong being in Huan Hua Palace, but our master has ordered us to keep it a strict secret, and not let outsiders know; violators would be expelled from Huan Hua Palace, so I couldn’t inform you of the situation.” Shen Qingqiu grabbed him, “I only have one question for you; when and how did Luo Binghe end up in your Huan Hua Palace?” Gongyi Xiao said, “It was Qin-shimei; last year she rescued a badly injured Luo-shixiong, badly injured and unconscious, next to the Luo River.”Last year. In only one short year he’d kicked Gongyi Xiao off from his position as most trusted disciple; it looked like not only had Luo Binghe’s annexation of Huan Hua Palace moved earlier, but even his efficiency had risen. And also, Gongyi Xiao really was cannon fodder, indeed meant to be kicked off various number-one positions by the male lead! Shen Qingqiu said, “Since he’d been rescued by you, why didn’t he return to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect?” Gongyi Xiao took careful stock of Shen Qingqiu’s expression, and cautiously said, “After being rescued and waking up, Luo-shixiong never brought up the past, and when he was giving his farewells, he disclosed… that he wouldn’t return to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect, so he hoped Huan Hua Palace would keep his whereabouts a secret; it seemed he intended to wander the world. Our master thinks very highly of Luo-shixiong, so he vigorously urged him to stay; they don’t call each other master and disciple, but from his treatment of him, he’s already no different than a succeeding disciple.” So that’s how it was. No wonder Huan Hua Palace’s disciples’ attitudes towards him just now had been hostile. This act of Luo Binghe’s, was the standard, “white lotus who’d been trampled, but silently endures” act. People would easily surmise: if everything was fine, why be unwilling to return? Maybe it’s because Cang Qiong Mountain Sect, especially Shen Qingqiu, had wronged him, and so that false news of his death at the Immortal Alliance Conference must also conceal terrible secrets. Luo Binghe’s brainwashing skills weren’t only talk; from seeing how everyone just then had neatly and blindly followed him, he knew how Luo Binghe stood within Hua Hua Palace right now. A disciple from Sect A took a trip to Sect B; the entire ranks within Sect B cried and begged for him to stay, and even hid and concealed him so other sects wouldn’t knowhow unscientific and unreasonable. But with the protagonist’s halo shining down it, it was absolutely logical! Shen Qingqiu was silent; Gongyi Xiao thought he was sad and disappointed. His beloved disciple hadn’t died, but preferred to roam around outside instead of returning to see him; of course this was deeply painful, and so he consoled, “Senior Shen doesn’t need to mind it too much; perhaps Luo- shixiong is just in the midst of a temporary internal conflict that he’s yet to resolve. Before he would never leave Huan Hua Palace’s sphere of influence, yet this time when he knew that Cang Qiong Mountain’s Senior Shen wasparticipating in rescue efforts, he took the initiative and asked to come here, so perhaps there’s some turn for the better. Although, my shidis and shimeis… ahem, on this matter, they’ve misunderstood something about Senior, I hope you won’t take this matter to heart.” Shen Qingqiu’s heart was as suffocated as a dammed-up river. The positive reputation he’d painstakingly fostered over many years, sure enough, was nothing compared to Luo Binghe’s ability to smear him without second thought, and what a thorough smearing. But on second thought, this couldn’t actually be considered smearing. Because he hadn’t suffered injustice at all: he had indeed kicked him down into the Endless Abyss! In the end, he couldn’t find any reason to justify or exonerate himself! Shen Qingqiu said, “And you? Why didn’t you misunderstand?” Gongyi Xiao was stunned for a short while, then said, “Though I don’t exactly what happened in Jue Di Gorge back then, but I believe that Senior is definitely not someone who would murder his own disciple.” After he said this, Gongyi Xiao flashed back to their meeting in Bai Lu Forest, over the things Shen Qingqiu had accidentally let slip and the way he’d affectionately gazed at that monster. Shen Qingqiu thought that, as expected, since we’re both cannon fonder fated to fall to the male lead’s indestructible body, we can understand and sympathize with each other’s situations. Therefore both parties were moved. While they were busy being pleased within their own minds, the group from Huan Hua Palace also caught up. Shen Qingqiu accidentally glanced backwards, and saw Luo Binghe looking over. Shen Qingqiu felt that in the short incense time since his reunion with Luo Binghe, his heart had become quite a bit more delicate, and would often feel like a small boat caught in a raging sea and storms. For example, right now, though Luo Binghe wasn’t standing close to him, and he maintained an appropriate smile on his face, but that pair of pitch-black eyes coldly pierced through him with incredible force; seeing this, Shen Qingqiu’s heart felt suffocated. Bing-ge, what’s wrong noweven two cannon fodder talking and huddling together for warmth a short while also offends you? Upon arriving at the entrance of Jin Zi Weapon Shop, he could hear that within, it was almost loud enough to overturn the roof. This was all thanks to Liu Qingge. He was responsible for hard labor, and after they’d separated, he’d gone to capture experimental subjects for Mu Qingfang. With the people in the city soalarmed, no one was willing to cooperate, and at this point they didn’t have the luxury to be concerned about this, so they could only use martial power to solve the problem. On top of that, Liu Qingge had never been a patient person who enjoyed reasoning with others. His style was very consistent with Bai Zhan Peak’s customs: he simply went out and grabbed whoever he saw, and in one pass had grabbed more than ten burly and macho men, then tied them by the forging station. That place had now already become Mu Qingfang’s research lab and experiments station. A group of big, strong men’s shouting, cursing, crying, and wailing, actually wouldn’t lose to that of married women’s. Once Shen Qingqiu arrived in the underground storage, he explained to the others the unexpected events just now. For the time being, he didn’t bring up that he himself had been infected. Master Wu Chen once again chanted Amitabha. “Thanks to our fellow cultivators from Cang Qiong Mountain, we’ve finally made progress on this situation.” Shen Qingqiu said, “I’m afraid it’s not that simple. The infected cannot infect each other, and it’s recorded in Qing Jing Peak’s ancient texts that the largest number a sower can infect in one go, is only around three hundred people. If it’s to infect something as large as the entire city, there definitely cannot be only one sower. Liu Qingge placed his hand on his sword’s hilt, and stood up. Shen Qingqiu knew he was the type to take action, who would leave without a second word, wanting to go out and find other sowers right now, and said, “Slow down! I still have something else to say.” Mu Qingfang: “Shixiong, go ahead?” Shen Qingqiu didn’t know how to start, and hesitated for a moment before saying, “Luo Binghe is back.” There was little reaction. In the first place, of the three, Master Wu Chen was from Zhao Hua Temple and didn’t know who Luo Binghe was; Mu Qingfang rarely cared about things other than medicine and the theory of medication, so only Liu Qingge frowned, stunned, and said, “That disciple of yours? Didn’t he die at the hands of demons during the Immortal Alliance Conference?” Shen Qingqiu found it was getting harder to explain. “… He didn’t die. He came back alive.” He stepped forwards and said, “Let’s patrol the city first. I’ll talk about this in detail when we get back.” Mu Qingfang said, “That’s good. The earlier we take care of all theremaining sowers, the fewers horrors the people will suffer. I also should go check on those patients.” As soon as he spoke, Shen Qingqiu thought of that brightly shining set of silver surgical tools Mu Qingfang always carried with him, with all kinds of knives and needles: when spread out they seemed to belong to the scene of a forensic autopsy. There were also hundreds upon thousands of bottles and jars in his infinite storage, with all sorts of labels; the words and descriptions on the labels were just like the taste and effects of contents within: stuff that would cause people to go green upon hearing, strike them with terror. In a moment, that group of macho men by the forging station upstairs would likely really overturn the roof. Shen Qingqiu let out a dry laugh, and was about to follow Liu Qingge out of the cellar, when suddenly, from out of nowhere, his heartbeat unexpectedly seemed a hundred times louder, and his movements also slowed, becoming sluggish. Liu Qingge sensed that something was off, and immediately asked, “What’s wrong?” Shen Qingqiu didn’t answer, and tried to summon a spiritual blast with his right hand: a feeble spiritual flow sputtered through it, and not a single spark formed. Fuck me, flaring up at such an important time; you screwing around with me?! Mu Qingfang said quietly, “Without-A-Cure.” Liu Qingge pressed down on his pulse, then waited for a moment, before resolutely pushing him back down. “Sit here and wait.” Wait for what? Wait for Luo Binghe to show up at their doors? Shen Qingqiu quickly stood up. “I’m leaving with you.” Liu Qingge never gave others face when speaking. “Stop being a hindrance.” Master you are the Bai Zhan Peak Lord, capable of holding off thousands alone! How would letting me fly with you be a hindrance! Mu Qingfang said, “Shen-shixiong, did you take your medication on time today?” Shen Qingqiu truly wanted to scream at the heavens, “I haven’t given up on therapy!!!” I clearly took my medication on time this month! And had Great Master Liu help circulate my meridians on time too! Exactly why would it randomlyflare up; it’s basically lightning from the heavens; I’m utterly baffled! At this moment, the System suddenly just had to, of all things, send a notification: Protagonist Satisfaction Points +100 You get out! By this are you saying, “whenever Shen Qingqiu meets with misfortune, the male lead is very satisfied?!” Mu Qingfang then added, “Shen-shixiong must not force yourself. Liu- shixiong is also doing this for your own good. Exerting yourself and moving around during a flare-up is enormously damaging. You stay here and rest; I’ll go prepare medicine; wait for Liu-shixiong to return, then he’ll help clear your meridians.” Shen Qingqiu stood up three times, but was pushed back down by Liu Qingge every time, and Mu Qingfang’s tone was as if he were lecturing an unruly child, so he could only helplessly say, “Very well. Liu-shidi, listen to me, the Sower’s entire body is covered with scarlet skin, and it is highly infectious; if you meet something suspicious that looks similar, don’t rashly approach it; attack from afar. Once you return you must immediately come to my room; I have something very important to discuss with you.” The last sentence was the most important; Shen Qingqiu deliberately enunciated the words with added emphasis. Comradeship is priceless and fraternal love is supreme; spend a thousand days training troops for the sake of one moment; Master Liu you absolutely must shield me! After the Liu-Mu pair left the cellar, Wu Chen thought intensely, and said, “Immortal Master Shen, don’t you think it strange? The Demon Realm had been quiet for so long; yet these years, there seem to be signs of a comeback. At the last Immortal Alliance Conference, many rare demonic creatures reappeared in the Human Realm. And this time Jin Lan City’s is even bigger, Sowers appearing, when they’d gone extinct a hundred years back; this one worries that this…most likely isn’t a good omen.” Shen Qingqiu deeply felt the same way. “Master’s apprehensions are also exactly why I can’t be at ease. And these Sowers are clearly a stronger version. I’ve never known of Sowers from a hundred years back with this kind of attribute, where the infected cannot exceed a certain distance from them, lest they undergo accelerated decay into skeletons.” And Luo Binghe originally should have stayed in the Endless Abyss for two more years, yet he’d broken out early. Could this fucking be a good omen!After being infected, Master Wu Chen’s qi circulation had received heavy damage, and the drain on his energy was enormous; not long into their discussion he became tired; Shen Qingqiu helped him lie down, then did his best to quietly leave the cellar. Hiding Wu Chen inside the cellar was so he wouldn’t be exposed to light or the elements; Shen Qingqiu’s room was instead inside the weapon’s shop, on the second floor. Liu Qingge had yet to return, and at this time even if he wanted to sleep it was impossible; he sat at the table and lost himself in his thoughts. At a moment he’d think of the little sheep Luo Binghe, who’d always followed him around while calling “Shizun;” at another moment he’d think of that black lotus Luo Binghe just now, who drenched him in unease from head to toe, until he wanted to rip out all his hair. After an unknown length of time, someone knocked on the door twice. Neither light nor heavy. Shen Qingqiu quickly stood up from the table. “Liu-shidi? I’ve been waiting for you the entire night, come in, quickly!” The room’s set of double doors suddenly flew open. Luo Binghe stood at the entrance; behind him was unbounded darkness; he had his hands tucked behind his back, his lips curved slightly upwards, but his eyes seemed like cold pools, a thousand meters deep. With his eyes squeezed into crescents, he said, “Shizun, hello.”"
"我擦来了！ 沈清秋刹那间如同脑浆沸腾 , 呼的一下烧了起来。这特么就是活活的午夜凶铃上演在跟 前！他抓起折扇 , 一个利落的翻身，从木窗翻了出去。 终于撕下了白天那副让人直起鸡皮疙瘩的伪装，暴露本性来找他算账了！ 逃跑完全是下意识驱使。多年养成的习惯，让他坚持就算是逃跑，也要跑得潇洒飘逸。落 地之后稳稳当当 , 脚底一点 , 身子掠了出去。 洛冰河清亮亮的声音穿透力极强 , 带着凉飕飕的笑意传到他耳边： “ 白日见师尊待公仪萧亲 近温柔，晚间又掌灯等柳师叔直至深夜 , 情意拳拳，怎么轮到弟子这里 , 就这般疏离了呢？ ” 卧槽每说一句距离感就拉近 n 倍这速度不科学！ 沈清秋深深吸一口气，心想不管怎样先找个帮手来说，从丹田发声喝道： “ 柳清歌！ ” 洛冰河的声音又逼近了，这次就没那么温和了，而是带了冷笑： “ 柳师叔正与人缠斗，恐 怕是没空闲来了。师尊你若有吩咐，不如和我说说？ ” 那可不敢当！ 沈清秋心知柳清歌多半被洛冰河使什么法子托住了，指望不上了，当下把全身灵力往下盘 灌去，指望爆一爆速度。 可他好死不死忘了，现在正是无可解毒性发作期间！ 反应过来时已经来不及了，那一瞬间全身血液都像是凝结了，沈清秋身体突然一沉。 下一刻，喉咙被猛地卡住，后背重重撞上冷硬的石墙壁，脊椎到皮肉都撞得生疼，脑袋里 嗡嗡震荡。 洛冰河已近在咫尺。 沈清秋被他单手掼到墙上，后脑勺咚的一下撞晕了，视线半晌才清明重叠起来。 月光流照，越发显得洛冰河轮廓仿佛冰雕玉琢，俊美无俦。 他靠得极近，轻声慢语道： “ 多年未见，师尊却不停地叫着别人的名字，弟子实在是有点 伤心了。 ” 他口口声声说着伤心难过，可唇带笑意眼带杀气，怎么看也是睁眼说瞎话！ 沈清秋只觉得喉咙仿佛被一只铁箍被掐住，喉头艰难滚动，咽气都困难，何况开口说话。 手指倒是能勉强结成剑诀，可他现在灵力滞涩，结了也是白结，成诀再标准也召不动修雅 剑。 而且，洛冰河的手正在渐渐用力，缓缓收紧。 突然，沈清秋眼前一亮，一个巨大的对话框弹了出来。 这个对话框可跟以前完全不一样。之前那个就像 xp 系统的错误信息提示，现在简约低调奢 华有内涵 …… 重点是内容！系统提示：【是否接受系统温馨提示以解决眼下贵方面临的小 困扰？】 你把这个叫做 “ 小困扰 ” ？！ 沈清秋在意识里声嘶力竭咆哮： “ 来！还有没有简单模式！求简单模式！ ” 系统：【权限激活。是否启用关键道具保持生存状态？】 沈清秋眼睛已经憋到发绿： “ 还有关键道具？！要多少 b 格爽度来买，你说吧！ ” 系统：【道具已在您的装备之中。是否使用 “ 假玉观音 ” 道具，消耗洛冰河 100 点怒气 值？】 我擦，洛冰河他养母留下的唯一遗物假玉观音！ 刚刚来到这个世界时就拿到的保命道具、高级装备，他怎么就一直给忘了，怀里揣着个金 饭碗讨饭，系统你总算是提醒对了一件事！ 沈清秋： “ 用用用！ ” 他一个喉结已经快被掐成两个了！ 系统：【温馨提示：本道具使用只限一次，最高可消耗洛冰河怒气值 5000. 】 沈清秋悬崖勒马： “ 等等  ！！！ ” 洛冰河现在这个状态怒气值才 100 点？！你逗我呢吧？！ 100 点就如此邪魅狂卷那他怒气值 5000 点的时候该是什么样子的那画面简直太美我不敢想象！重点是  用最高可以消 5000 的道具应对只有 100 的情况，而且从此失去使用机会，就算现在性命攸关，沈清秋还是需 要一点时间来心疼和纠结！ 这样下去，不是窒息身亡，就是喉骨粉碎而死。 就在沈清秋狠下心肠准备咬牙使用保命道具时，颈间骤然一松。 沈清秋撑了一把墙壁，勉强站定，总算是没当场扑通一声跪下。跑也跑不掉，干脆直面 boss 。 洛冰河刚刚差点把他活活掐死，现在又笑眯眯地过来扶他，一如以往扶他下马车或者送点 心时的表情。沈清秋一时居然忘了挣脱，只觉得这精分一般的行为举止让人毛骨悚然。 洛冰河叹道： “ 师尊跑那么快做什么？弟子险些就追不上了。 ” 呵呵，追不上个屁。是谁刚才那么好整以暇一口气都不带喘的紧跟在后面玩了半天猫捉老 鼠？ 沈清秋喘了几口气，缓缓开口，声音有点发哑： “ 你胆子不小。堂而皇之地回来，不怕别 人发现你真实身份？ ” 洛冰河眼光闪动，道： “ 师尊是关心这个，还是担心这个？ ” 沈清秋觉得他这话挺有意思的。 “ 关心 ” 和 “ 担心 ” ，用在这里有什么区别吗？ 他忍不住问： “ 你莫非觉得，我不会告诉别人？ ” 洛冰河看着他，口气怜惜道： “ 师尊，那也要别人肯相信你。 ” 沈清秋心底咯噔一声。 他这意思，是打算像原作那样，先把让自己身败名裂，然后再慢慢一步一步、逼上绝路、 慢慢玩死？ 原作沈清秋有两大渣点： 1 ，猥亵多名少女与妇女； 2 ，残杀多名同门与非同门。 可沈清秋自问，自从用了这个壳子后，绝对没有继承原主这些爱好与志向。洛冰河还能让 他声名威望社会地位都毁尽吗？ 系统：【友情解答：当然能。】 沈清秋： “ 闭嘴好吗。只有男主想不到，没有他办不到。我当然知道他能谢谢。 ” 系统：【不客气。本次解答不收取 b 格值。】 沈清秋直接叉掉了弹出的对话框。 他揉了揉喉咙，站了一会，发现洛冰河居然就这么睁着一双眼睛看着他，没有要继续动手 的意思。 还看？ 总不会是觉得分别了几年，要把没看够的补回来吧？ 系统：【主角爽度 +50. 】 沈清秋： “ 你升了级，怎么连加分理由都省略掉了？回头别说我刷分。我什么都没干，哪 来的爽度值加。还有你能暂时别出现吗！ ” 半晌，沈清秋道： “ 你回来，究竟是想做什么？ ” 洛冰河道： “ 无非想念师尊待我的好，回来看看罢了。 ” 沈清秋自动理解为是回来找他清算陈年老账的 与洛冰河一问一答，居然还算和谐，沈清秋说话也渐渐肥了胆子，不动声色，手指移到剑 柄上： “ 只为杀我？那金兰城中的瘟疫算怎么回事？难不成这城里居民，都 ‘ 待你好 ’ ？ ” 谁知，这句话一出来，不知触到了洛冰河哪片逆鳞，他眼中刹那间仿佛寒星陨落，刚若有 若无散开的一丝笑意也消失无踪。 半晌，洛冰河道： “ 师尊对魔族果真是深恶痛绝。 ” 语气中，有一丝强压怒气的痕迹。 没有啦其实。 洛冰河咬牙： “ 不，应该说是对我深恶痛绝。 ” 你看，你这不是挺懂吗 …… 啥啥啥？ 我可没这么说。深恶痛绝的地步还不至于，就是有点心理阴影而已。脑补不要太过分谢 谢！ 洛冰河猛地朝他逼近一步，沈清秋神色猛地警惕起来，也跟着后退一步。 两人目光在空气中碰撞，洛冰河又像觉察到自己的暴躁，开口声音越发冰冷。 “ 师尊是不是真的觉得，杀人放火屠城戮国这种事情，只因为我身体里那一半血统，迟早 都会做尽？ ” 沈清秋只能保持沉默。 如果他手头有一本《狂傲仙魔途》的实体版，估计早就一巴掌把书拍他脸上去了。 有锤上锤！两千万字的大长篇后面满满都是你要的锤子！岂止杀人放火屠城戮国，你都把 魔界仙界艹翻天了，鸡犬不留用来形容你干的事已经失去其夸张手法的意义了！ 洛冰河见沈清秋敛眸垂睫，一语不发，就当他默认了，冷笑道： “ 既然如此，当初又为什 么要说不论种族，只分善恶这种冠冕堂皇的话？ ” 他忽然脸色阴沉下来，眉间戾气横生，猛地出手喝道： “ 虚伪至极！ ” 沈清秋早有防备，这时急急后退，险险避过。回头一看，刚才背靠的墙壁已粉碎了一片。 虽然他早知道，从无间深渊那种地方出来后，洛冰河会性情大变，可没想到真的翻天覆地 变到这种地步。说喜怒无常都轻了。 预知书中结果是一回事，可看着一个曾经很熟悉的人变成这样，又是另外一回事。尤其是 这结果基本可以算他一手造成的。 洛冰河好像本来也没想真的要击中他，暴击一次发泄过后，消了些气，一侧头，伸手似乎 要去捉他。沈清秋猛地拔出修雅剑。 他已经很久没手动拔剑了，从前多半是用剑诀召唤，现在没了灵力只能人工操作。没办法 ，他不能束手就擒，至少在这个时候，他绝对不能坐以待毙。 这真是天大的失算。原本以为洛冰河要练足五年，才会从无间深渊爬上来，谁知道他挂开 得越发大，硬是把时间提前了一半。而算算日子，沈清秋作为保命王牌圈养着的日月露华 芝，还没养到能够起作用的时候。 洛冰河见状，慢慢举起一手，让沈清秋看清掌间滚滚翻腾流转的紫黑魔息，慢条斯理道： “ 师尊。你猜，如果修雅剑被我抓住了，要几次才会被侵蚀殆尽？ ” 不用猜了，我赌五毛最多一次！沈清秋心中倍感凄凉。 洛冰河再逼近一步，沈清秋只得挺剑迎击。 他本来都做好了修雅剑报废的心理准备，谁知洛冰河像忽然看到什么，怔了一下，猛地撤 去了掌间魔器，直接用手截住了剑锋。 沈清秋没想到真的会刺到他。这已经是第二次了！就这么一愣的功夫，洛冰河在他腕上一 砍，手掌顿松，长剑垂坠地，被洛冰河踢飞。 洛冰河一只手紧紧攥着沈清秋手腕，掌心有鲜血流出，浸透了沈清秋的袖子，血一直在流 啊流啊流的，让他无端端心里堵得慌。正云里雾里间，洛冰河把他的手翻了过来： “ 受染 了？ ” 沈清秋手臂上零散地分布着几点小小红斑，比白天时稍有增加。 洛冰河修长的手指在上面若有若无掠过，那几点红斑在他指尖溃散。 果然，对洛冰河而言，这点小东西根本构不成威胁。 洛冰河似乎缓和了颜色，道： “ 师尊这只手，倒也多灾多难。 ” …… 他们俩居然想到一块儿去了。沈清秋看着自己光洁如初的手背，越发搞不清楚洛冰河 的脑回路。照目前看来，也许是想起这只手也帮他挡过毒铠甲上的倒刺，还有几分顾念旧 情？ 他正这么猜测，突然，小腹被人捣上一拳。 洛冰河微笑道： “ 一码归一码，既然是师尊挑起的头，那就自己咽下苦果。师尊留下的伤 口，就自己好好补偿。 ” 沈清秋还以为他是在用象征比喻手法抒发自己当年给他留下的心灵创伤，谁知头皮一痛， 被硬生生扯起脖子，洛冰河的手送到嘴唇边来，一股血腥味往嘴里涌去。 沈清秋猝然睁大双眼。 他这才醒悟，洛冰河指的 “ 伤口 ” ，是自己刚才用修雅剑在他手上留下的伤口！ 卧槽泥煤  不能喝不能喝这玩意儿绝对不能喝！ 他猛地拍开那只手，低头要把咽下去几口的鲜血呕出来，被洛冰河强行拧起，继续灌血。 洛冰河把自己手上伤口撕裂开了，温热的血液滚滚不绝，他反而像是越发开心的模样： “ 师尊，别吐啊，天魔之血虽然污秽，但喝了也不一定会死的，对吧？ ” 是不会死，但是会生不如死啊！ 作者有话要说：发现上一章字数爆的好严重 ……","CHAPTER 34: LIKE AN EVIL BEAST Oh shit he’s here! In an instant, it was as if Shen Qingqiu’s brains had started boiling, catching fire with a whoosh. Fuck, The Ring was playing out live in front of his eyes! He grabbed his fan, and with a nimble flip, leapt out the window. So he’d finally torn down that goosebump-raising mask he’d been wearing in the daytime, and exposing his true nature had come to make him pay! Running away was an entirely subconscious urge. The habit of playing cool he’d formed after so many years allowed him to persevere so that even while fleeing, his movements were easy and graceful. He landed solidly on the ground, and with a tap of his foot, darted away like a flying bird. Luo Binghe’s clear and bright voice pierced far through the air, reaching his ears while carrying a hint of cold, drifting laughter. “During the day, Shizun was so intimate and gentle with Gongyi Xiao, and this evening you lit a lantern, waiting for Liu-shishu until late into the night; what sincere affection. Why then, are you so distant when it comes to this disciple?” Fuck, it feels like he’s cutting the distance in half with every sentence; this speed is unscientific! Shen Qingqiu drew in a deep breath, thinking that no matter what happens, he should find himself some backup first, and shouted from the pit of his stomach, “Liu Qingge!” Luo Binghe’s voice drew even closer; this time, it was no longer as gentle, but rather came with a cold laugh. “Liu-shishu is currently fighting, so I’m afraid he won’t have the leisure to come. Shizun, if you have orders, why not say them to me?” I wouldn’t dare! Shen Qingqiu knew Luo Binghe must have used some method to delay Liu Qingge; his assistance couldn’t be relied on; immediately he poured his entire body’s spiritual energy downwards, hoping to boost his speed. But he just had to forget, right now he was in the middle of Without-A- Cure’s flare-up! When he realized, it was already too late: in an instant, it was like all the blood in Shen Qingqiu’s body had solidified, and his whole body suddenly felt heavy. In the next moment, a hand suddenly clutched his throat and his backcrashed heavily into a cold and solid rock wall, the pain resonating from his flesh into his spine, his head buzzing. Luo Binghe was already within arms’ reach. He had slammed Shen Qingqiu into the wall with one hand; the back of his head rang with the crash, swooning; it took a while before he could refocus his gaze. Under the streaming moonlight, Luo Binghe looked even more as if his silhouette was carved from ice and jade, peerlessly beautiful. He pressed very close, and spoke slowly and deliberately. “After so many years of separation, we meet amidst golden wind and jade dew 126 , yet Shizun incessantly calls someone else’s name. This disciple is truly a bit hurt.” He says he’s hurt and broken-hearted, but there’s a smile on his lips and bloodlust in his eyes; anyway you look at it, he’s lying through his teeth! Shen Qingqiu felt as if his neck was caught in an iron hoop; his throat bobbed with difficulty, and it was hard to breathe, let alone speak. He could still manage to form a sword seal with his fingers, but his spiritual energy circulation was sluggish, so it was pointless anyhow; no matter how perfect of a seal he formed, he couldn’t move Xiu Ya. And, Luo Binghe was pressing harder and harder, his hand slowly tightening. Suddenly, there was a flash before Shen Qingqiu’s eyes and a giant dialogue box popped up. This dialogue box was entirely different from before. Before, they’d all looked like Windows XP error boxes, but now it was subdued, lavish, and sophisticated… The main point was the content! System reminder: Accept a System tip to resolve the small complication our valued customer is facing? You call this a “small complication”?! Shen Qingqiu mentally shouted himself hoarse, “Alright! Is there still an easy mode! Easy Mode please!” System: Access privileges activated. Use key prop to maintain state of living? Shen Qingqiu’s eyes were nearly about to go green from suffocation. “There’s a key prop?! How many B-points to buy it, tell me!” System: Prop is already in your inventory. Use “fake jade Guanyin” to consume 100 of Luo Binghe’s anger points? Oh shit, the only thing Luo Binghe’s adoptive mother left to him, the fakejade Guanyin! Right after arriving in this world, he’d acquired this life-saving prop and high-tier equipment, how had he forgotten? He still had this golden food bowl tucked away in his bosom; System, you finally gave a useful reminder! Shen Qingqiu: “I will I will I will!” His throat was about to be squeezed into two! System: Please note: This prop is single-use, and can consume a maximum of 5000 of Luo Binghe’s anger points. Shen Qingqiu just managed to yank on the reins. “Stop!!!” This was Luo Binghe at only 100 anger points?! Are you messing with me?! If he’s already so crazed and violent at 100, how beautiful would the scene of him at 5000 anger points be; he dared not imagine! The main point wasto use a prop that could remove 5000 points on a situation that was only 100, and to lose the chance to use it ever again, even if it was a matter of life and death, Shen Qingqiu needed some time to agonize and struggle! If things went on like this, it was either a death from suffocation, or from his throat being pulverized. Just when Shen Qingqiu made up his mind, prepared to clench his teeth and use the life-saving prop, the hand around his neck suddenly loosened. There was no way he could get away even if he tried to run, so he could only continue playing cool. Shen Qingqiu propped himself up on the wall, barely managing to stand upright, and not plop to his knees on the spot. Luo Binghe had just almost choked him to death, and now he was coming over to help him up, all smiles, just like when he had helped him off carriages or brought him snacks in the past. Shen Qingqiu actually forgot to struggle, only feeling that this schizophrenic behavior was making his hair stand on end. Luo Binghe sighed, “Why did Shizun run so fast? This disciple almost could not catch up.” Bullshit. Who’d just been chasing after him in a game of cat-and-mouse for such a long time, entirely unruffled and with his breathing completely even? Shen Qingqiu panted, then slowly opened his mouth, his voice a bit hoarse. “You have quite the nerve. Returning in such a grandiose fashion, aren’t you afraid someone will discover your true identity?” Luo Binghe’s eyes flashed, and he said, “Is Shizun concerned or worried?” Shen Qingqiu thought this was an interesting reply. In these circumstances, was there any difference between “concerned” and “worried”?He couldn’t resist asking, “Unless you think I won’t tell anyone?” Luo Binghe looked at him, then said pityingly, “Shizun, that would require someone to believe you.” Shen Qingqiu’s heart thumped. So this meant that he was planning to, just like in the original work, first utterly destroy his reputation, then slowly, step by step, force him onto the road to ruin, and slowly toy with him until he died? The original Shen Qingqiu had two major scum points: 1, attempting to get a taste of many young ladies and married women; 2, murdering many comrades and others. But Shen Qingqiu, after taking this shell, had definitely not inherited these interests and ambitions from the original. Could Luo Binghe still destroy his prestigious reputation and place in society? System: Friendly reminder: of course. Shen Qingqiu: “Shut up, okay? You don’t need to remind me of this fact, thanks.” System: You’re welcome. No B-points will be collected for this explanation. Shen Qingqiu directly x’d out of the dialogue box that had popped up. He rubbed his throat and stood for a while, then realized that Luo Binghe was actually still staring at him, with no intention of attacking again. Still looking? He wouldn’t be trying to make up for lost time after being separated for years, would he? System: Protagonist satisfaction points +50. Shen Qingqiu: “You’ve had an upgrade, so why are you omitting even the reason for the point increase? Don’t accuse me of farming points later. I didn’t even do anything; where are the satisfaction points coming from? Also, can you stop appearing for a bit?” After a while, Shen Qingqiu asked, “What are you planning to do with your return?” Luo Binghe replied, “I was merely reminiscing about how Shizun had treated me well, and wanted to return to see you.” Shen Qingqiu automatically understood this as him coming back to settle old debts. He had traded a question and answer with Luo Binghe; this could actually be considered harmonious, so Shen Qingqiu slowly grew braver: without achange in expression, he moved his hand to his sword hilt. “Just to kill me? Then what about the plague in Jin Lan City? Has every resident of this city ‘treated you well?’” Who knew that as soon as these words came out of his mouth, they must have touched some sore point of Luo Binghe’s. It was like within his eyes a cold star had fallen, and the faint hint of a smile on his face disappeared without a trace. Luo Binghe said mockingly, “Shizun truly holds a relentless hatred towards the demon race.” There was a hint of forcibly suppressed anger in his voice. No I don’t, really. Luo Binghe clenched his teeth. “No, I should say, a relentless hatred towards me.” See, he does understand… what what what? Shen Qingqiu was speechless he’d never said that! Luo Binghe took a sudden step towards him; Shen Qingqiu’s expression quickly became cautious, and he retreated a step. But behind his back was a wall, and so nowhere to retreat. Their gazes collided in midair, then Luo Binghe seemed to realize that he was too agitated, and closed his eyes, only opening them again after a few moments had passed. “So Shizun truly thinks that I would kill, burn, slaughter cities, and topple countries sooner or later just because of half of my lineage?” Shen Qingqiu could only keep his silence. If he had a paper copy of Proud Immortal Demon Way at hand, he would already have slapped it onto his face. If you have a hammer, then use it! The latter part of that twenty million epic was full of the hammers he wanted. Not only kill, burn, slaughter cities, and topple countries, using ‘not a dog or fowl was spared’ to describe the things Luo Binghe had done had already lost its dramatic effect… Seeing Shen Qingqiu look down without a single word, Luo Binghe took it as tacit agreement, and sneered while saying, “Then, why would you tell me not to put too much weight on race, that no one is intolerable to the heavens, such pompous words like these?” His face suddenly grew dark, malice overflowing from between his brows, then he abruptly struck and yelled, “Hypocrite!” Shen Qingqiu was long prepared; at this moment he quickly retreated, andjust managed to dodge. He turned his head, and saw that the wall he’d just been leaning against had been pulverized. Though he’d long known that after coming back from a place like the Endless Abyss, Luo Binghe’s temperament would change, he never thought he would actually take such an extreme 180. Moody didn’t even begin to describe it. Knowing the novel’s conclusion ahead of time was one thing, but seeing a once-familiar person turn into this was another thing entirely. Especially because this result had been basically single-handedly created by him. It seemed like Luo Binghe had never really intended to hit him; after venting his anger with this attack, he calmed down a bit, tilted his head, and reached out, seemingly to grab him. Shen Qingqiu quickly drew Xiu Ya. It’d been a long time since he’d drawn his sword by hand; most of the time he’d summon it with a sword seal most of the time, but now that he had no spiritual energy, he could only do it manually. There was nothing to be done, he couldn’t just offer himself up for capture; at least in this moment, he definitely could not sit still and await death. This was truly a gargantuan blunder. He’d thought Luo Binghe would train for the full five years before he crawled out from the Endless Abyss; who knew he would activate his cheats even more and speed up the process by a half. And calculating the days, the Sun-Moon Dew Mushroom he’d been growing as his life-saving trump card had not yet grown to the point where it could be used. Seeing this, Luo Binghe slowly raised a hand, letting Shen Qingqiu see the violet-black demonic energy roiling in his palm, and said slowly, “Shizun. Take a guess; if I grab Xiu Ya, how many strikes will it take before it’s corroded through?” No need to guess; I’ll bet fifty cents on one strike at most! Shen Qingqiu felt even more miserable. Luo Binghe took another step closer, and Shen Qingqiu could only raise his sword to take the attack. He had already mentally prepared for Xiu Ya to be destroyed, but suddenly, like Luo Binghe had seen something, he stared, then quickly withdrew the demonic energy in his hand, grabbing the tip of the sword with his bare hand. Shen Qingqiu didn’t think he would actually cut him. This was already the second time! In this moment of shock, Luo Binghe had already chopped down on his wrist; Shen Qingqiu’s hand loosened in pain, and his sword fell, then was sent flying with a single finger by Luo Binghe.Luo Binghe clamped down on Shen Qingqiu’s wrist with a single hand, fresh blood flowing from his palm, soaking Shen Qingqiu’s sleeve; the blood kept flowing and flowing, and he started to panic in worry for no reason. While he was still in the midst of confusion, Luo Binghe flipped his hand over. “You were infected?” Some small red patches were scattered across the back of Shen Qingqiu’s hand, a few more than there had been during the day. Luo Binghe’s slender fingers flitted across it in a barely-there touch, and the red patches disappeared under his fingertips like ink dropped in water. As expected, a little thing like this was no threat to Luo Binghe. Luo Binghe seemed to have moderated his expression. He said, “This hand of Shizun’s is plagued with misfortunes.” They had both thought the same thing. Looking at his spotless hand, Shen Qingqiu even more could not understand the course of Luo Binghe’s thoughts. Looking at it so far, perhaps this hand had brought up old affections; thinking about it, this was the hand which had blocked the poisoned armor’s spikes; perhaps it had brought up some old memories? Just as he was thinking this, a fist suddenly slammed into his stomach. Luo Binghe smiled and said, “An eye for an eye, since Shizun sowed the seeds, you should reap the bitter fruit yourself. Shizun should make up for the wounds he gave me.” Shen Qingqiu thought he was using a relatively comparable method to vent his anger for the wound that had been left on his heart years ago, but with a sudden pain on his own scalp, his neck was dragged upright and Luo Binghe pressed his hand to his lips, the taste of blood flooding his mouth. Shen Qingqiu suddenly opened his eyes wide. He finally realized that the “wound” Luo Binghe was talking about was the one he had just left on his hand with Xiu Ya! Motherfuckercan’t drink it, can’t drink it, he absolutely can’t drink this! He furiously slapped away that hand and bent over to retch up the mouthfuls of blood he had swallowed, but Luo Binghe dragged him back up and continued to pour blood into his mouth. Luo Binghe tore open the wound on his hand; hot blood flowed endlessly, yet he seemed even happier. “Shizun, don’t throw it up; even though a heavenly demon’s blood is dirty, you won’t necessarily die if you drink it, right?” You wouldn’t die, but you would live a fate worse than death!"
"沈清秋不知回到金字兵器铺的 , 上了楼 , 进了房间还浑浑噩噩，一头栽倒在床上，只觉得脑 浆、胃液、血流都在翻江倒海，有什么东西顺着它们爬来爬去，辗转反侧。 上古天魔之血 , 离体之后 , 仍能受血统继承者操纵 , 如被旁人饮下，的确后果不一定只有死 , 更 糟糕，可能性有很多种。 比如原作中 , 洛冰河对自己的血操纵自如后，其作用包括毒药、人体寄生血蛊虫、追踪定 位仪、物理洗脑工具、情趣工具 …… 等等。 沈清秋浑身冷汗，半梦半醒，到黎明时才沉沉睡去。还没睡多久，就被阵阵撼天动地的欢 呼生生吵醒。 他跌跌撞撞滚下床。因为晚上和衣躺下的，也不用穿衣。刚要打开门，突然门自己弹开， 闯进来一个蹦蹦跳跳的少年。 杨一玄激动道： “ 城门开了！城门开了！ ” 沈清秋： “ 什么？ ” 杨一玄嚷嚷道： “ 那些浑身红色的怪物都被抓住了，城门打开了！金兰城总算是挺过来 了！ ” 想到父亲的死，眼中又带起泪花。沈清秋自己稀里糊涂，却要去安慰他，心道：这 么快，一晚上就都抓住了？ 城门既开，之前在几里外观望的各派修士都涌入城中，聚集在一片开阔的广场地上，木清 芳也在那里发放配制的药丸。前几日还死气沉沉的金兰城一片欢喜洋溢。 一共抓住了七名活着的撒种人，全都用隔离在昭华寺的结界中。 沈清秋见柳清歌若有所思，走上去低声道： “ 昨晚怎么回事。 ” 柳清歌看他一眼： “ 你徒弟怎么回事？ ” 沈清秋： “ 他干了什么？ ” 柳清歌缓缓道： “ 昨晚，他抓住了五个，我抓住了两个。 ” 他看着沈清秋： “ 洛冰河消失的 这几年里，究竟发生了什么？ ” 能从百战峰主人手底下抢怪、而且要命的是抢赢了，这真的是非常毁百战峰传人三观的事 ，简直奇耻大辱！ 而且这数据是不是可以盖章，从武力值来讲，现在的情况是洛冰河：柳清歌 =5:2…… 忽然，近处弟子齐齐收敛嘈杂，自觉开道，腾出空间。不远，几派首脑人物缓缓走来。岳 清源和幻花宫宫主并行，随后，天一观与昭华寺各行其道。 洛冰河就站在幻花宫宫主身旁。 清晨初阳照耀得他一派神清气爽神采飞扬，沈清秋拿来对比了一下自己，顿感郁郁。 连岳清源走近了，看了他一会儿，也担忧道： “ 师弟，你脸色，太差了。果然不该让你来 的。 ” 沈清秋干笑： “ 只是昨夜没睡好。 ” 木清芳派完药丸回来，也是一惊： “ 师兄，为何一晚上就变成这样？我放在你房间的药吃 了吗？ ” 沈清秋忙道： “ 吃了，吃了。 ” 千万不要再问他今天吃药没了！ 那头忽然传来一阵喧哗。沈清秋侧首望去，顿时想扶额掉头。只见有一中年男子，披麻戴 孝，领着一大帮男男女女，非要在洛冰河面前跪下，正是那金兰城城主。 他激动不能自已： “ 小城蒙各位仙师舍身相救，此恩无以为报，日后若有吩咐，定当万死 不辞！ ” 沈清秋嘴角抽了抽，真是标准剧情，刷完怪，收小弟收奖励了。而这种时候，永远都只有 主角一个人抢光，跟着一起出力的其他人都当背景板了。他自己不说，好歹还有两个是柳 清歌抓的呢，木清芳刚才还在那儿发药呢。 洛冰河的应对也非常标准，谦虚道： “ 城主快快请起。金兰城安然渡过此劫，多亏各派同 心协力相助，一人之力，断难通天。 ” 他说话举止，既诚恳又得体，别派听了固然心里平衡了点，自己风光也不损，城主又是一 阵大赞： “ 昨夜亲眼见这位公子一力降住这些害人东西，修为了得。果真是年少出英雄， 名师出高徒！宫主您老人家后继有人了。 ” 洛冰河听见 “ 名师出高徒 ” 五个字时，笑意加深，有意无意目光掠过这边，蜻蜓点水般在沈 清秋脸上点了一下。 沈清秋展扇回避。 老宫主看着洛冰河的目光，赞许中带着慈爱。旁人也许看不懂，但沈清秋非常懂，这就是 看未来接班人 + 得意女婿的目光。 那七个被团团困住的撒种人桀桀乱叫，令人心中烦躁。有人道： “ 这些龌龊东西，该怎么 处置？ ” 岳清源道： “ 清秋，你可有想法？ ” 沈清秋沉吟道： “ 有看过古籍记载，撒种人畏惧高温。似乎有提过，烈火焚烧之法，才能 除尽他们这身躯的腐蚀传染力。 ” 非常好理解，消毒必须用高温。 有修士震惊道： “ 这 …… 这如何使得，这种方法，岂非和魔族一样野蛮残忍？ ” 他的声音很快被湮灭在周围金兰城幸存城民一片愤怒的呼喝中。 瘟疫横行的这段日子里，城中已有无数无辜生命逝去，而且死状全身溃烂，惨不忍睹。好 好一座繁华的商业之都，变成了如今这副鬼模样。这时候对撒种人表示同情和发扬人道主 义，就等于是整个金兰城的敌人。那几名修士很快就发现，他们被排山倒海的 “ 烧了他 们！ ”“ 谁反对就跟着一起烧了！ ” 包围了。 七名撒种人在结界中，大多都龇牙咧嘴，桀桀大笑，毫不示软。沈清秋觉得，它们很可能 还认为自己是为本种族创造粮产丰收的英雄。只有一名身材最为瘦小的撒种人抱头痛哭。 见状，有人又开始同情心泛滥。秦婉约咬咬嘴唇，靠近洛冰河道： “ 洛公子，那名弱小的 撒种人，看起来好可怜啊。 ” 洛冰河对她笑了笑，并未应答。 在沈清秋看来，这对妹子的反应真够敷衍的，应该算不及格，照原作难道他这时候不应该 趁机温言软语表示同感吗？怎么洛冰河练级速度提升了，把妹手段下降了？ 奈何人家就长了一张任何角度和表情都仿佛温润如玉潇洒倜傥的脸，秦婉约晃了一下神， 自己刚才说过的话也抛到脑后，很满足地继续围观了。 “ 他们看起来好可怜 ” 再可怜，有那些莫名其妙染上瘟疫全身溃烂而死的人可怜吗？ 沈清秋心中正吐槽，这时，一件远远超出他意料之外的事情发生了。 那名瘦小的撒种人猛扑过来，咚地撞上结界边缘，猩红的脸因嚎啕大哭越发狰狞，大喝道 ：“ 沈仙师，您可千万别让他们烧死我啊。我求求您了，沈仙师求您救救我啊！ ” 刹那间，沈清秋觉得脑子里有根弦，绷断了。 …… 你特么谁啊你！！！ 随随便便扑过来还有叫什么沈仙师我真的不认识你好吗！！！ 整个广场上，数千双眼睛一下子聚焦在沈清秋身上。 那名撒种人继续干嚎道： “ 我们只听您的吩咐行事，可没说过要被火烧啊！ ” ……wtf ！！！ 这种神展开，这种简单粗暴的指控！沈清秋也是醉得彻底了。 让他更醉的是，幻花宫老宫主道： “ 这东西口中所言，沈仙师是否应当作出一番解释呢？ ” 可偏偏这么低级的手法还有人信！ 立即有旁人附和道： “ 不错！ ” 而且还不止一个人！ 十二峰对外同气连枝，此话一出，矛头指向十分明显，不少苍穹山派修士都显出不悦之 色。岳清源更直接冷了脸。 齐清萋讥嘲道： “ 但凡长了心眼的，都该看得出来，分明是这东西死到临头不甘心，还想 拉个垫背的，根本是诬陷，魔界宵小都是一水儿的这个德性，居然还会有人上钩，说出去 真要笑死人啦！ ” 老宫主淡淡地道： “ 那为何不诬陷别人，单单诬陷沈仙师，倒也值得思考。 ” 沈清秋被他的逻辑折服了。 洛冰河一语不发，仍是一副温文俊秀的模样，专注盯着这边，表情是恰到好处的讶然。 但是，沈清秋绝对敢保证，他漆黑如星眼睛里，满是笑意。 原作中让沈清秋罪不可恕的仇恨点在于，他残害同门，亲手杀了柳清歌，不过现在，柳清 歌就站在他旁边站着呢。万一有谁要揍他，说不定柳清歌还会帮把手。罪名完全不成立！ 污点不够，污蔑来凑？ 很好。洛冰河，你够狠！ 忽然，幻花宫站出来一名弟子，脸上有点小麻子，正是那日废楼中出言讥讽沈清秋的弟 子。他躬身道： “ 宫主，弟子方才发现一事，不知当讲不当讲。 ” 沈清秋面无表情道： “ 有话便说。既然都开口了，还说什么 ‘ 不知当讲不讲当 ’ ？ ” 这不是自 己打自己脸么？ 那名弟子估计是没想到有前辈会来跟自己呛声，脸上一阵红一阵白，连麻子都似乎跟着变 色了，又不敢呛回去，只得狠狠瞪向沈清秋： “ 昨日弟子和几名师兄妹都发觉，沈前辈手 臂上有几点受染的红斑，看的真真切切，可是今天再看，红斑已经尽数消失了！ ” “ 苍穹山派木前辈亲口说过，方才在城中发放的药丸须得十二个时辰才能起效。洛公子当 着我们的面吃下解药，到现在手上的红斑还没消。为何只有沈前辈痊愈得这么快，红斑都 褪得看不见了？无论如何，弟子以为，此点十分可疑！ ” 沈清秋心中叹气：他就知道洛冰河压根没那么好心帮他拔除腐种。 岳清源缓缓道： “ 我师弟坐镇清静峰，身为峰主，历来是派中表率，品性高洁，门中无一 不知，无一不晓。诸位也未免太轻信无稽之谈了些。 ” 沈清秋老脸都要红了。师兄你别这样，你是认真的吗，要是为了保我让你昧着良心这么说 话，实在过意不去！无论原装还是现货，估计都连 “ 品性高洁 ” 的边儿都摸不到。哦不对， 原装货好歹能摸到第二个字。 老宫主道： “ 是吗？这和我听到的，可不太一样。 ” 沈清秋的心沉了下去。 看来今天，他是非得被拖下水不可了。 作者有话要说：呼，终于发完了 …… 希望这次没有卡在让大家想杀人的地方。","CHAPTER 35: BLACKENED REPUTATION PART 1 Shen Qingqiu didn’t know how he made it back to the Gold Weapon shop. He went upstairs to his room, still dazed, and fell onto his bed. All he could think about was how the blood that had been poured into his stomach was now flowing around his entire body. He tossed and turned all night long. When an ancient demon’s blood leaves their body it can still be manipulated by the heirs of that bloodline. If someone drinks it, death was not the only possible consequence. In fact, among the many possibilities, death wasn’t even the worst. For example, in the original novel, Luo Binghe was able to easily manipulate his blood in a variety of ways, including using it as a poison, tracker, brainwashing and sex tool, human parasitic blood mites, and so on. Shen Qingqiu was covered in cold sweat, half-awake and half-asleep, until he finally fell into a deep sleep at dawn. He hadn’t slept for long when he was awakened by the sound of earthshakingly loud cheering. He stumbled out of bed. Since he had fallen into bed with all his clothes on, he didn’t need to dress himself. Just as he was about to open the door, it shot open and an excited teenager bounced his way in. Yang Yixuan said excitedly, “The city gate is open! The city gate is open!” Shen Qingqiu: “What?” Yang Yixuan shouted, “Those red monsters have all been caught! The gates are open! Jinlan City is finally saved!” The thought of his father’s sacrifice brought tears to his eyes. Shen Qingqiu had a splitting headache but he still tried to comfort the teenager. He thought to himself, So fast! They were all caught in just one night? The moment the gates were opened, various cultivators who had been watching from the sidelines a few miles outside of the city swarmed inside, gathering at the city’s plaza where Mu Qingfang was distributing the pills he had prepared. The formerly lifeless Jinlan City residents were now full of joy. A total of seven sowers had were captured alive. They were currently being kept isolated in an enchanted barrier set by Zhao Hua Temple. Shen Qingqiu saw Liu Qingge, who seemed absorbed in thought. Shen Qingqiu went up to him and clapped him on the back: “What happened last night?” Liu Qingge glanced at him and said darkly: “What happened to yourdisciple?” Shen Qingqiu: “What did he do?” Liu Qingge said slowly: “Last night, he caught five, and I caught two.” He looked at Shen Qingqiu: “What happened during the years of Luo Binghe’s disappearance?” For someone to fight for kills with the Bai Zhan Peak Lord, and for this suicidal upstart to actually win, was something that could really shatter the worldview of Bai Zhan Peak’s disciples! It’s extraordinarily shameful and humiliating! Regarding those two’s power rankings, the data is clear. The current situation is this Luo Binghe: Liu Qingge = 5: 2… Suddenly, the noisy crowd of disciples simultaneously hushed and parted, consciously making room for a group of people. Not far away from them, a group of leaders slowly walked forward. Yue Qingyuan and the Old Palace Master of Huan Hua Palace walked side by side while the head cultivators of the Tian Yi Monastery and Zhao Hua Temple walked closely behind them. Luo Binghe stood next to the Old Palace Master. In the early morning sunlight, Luo Binghe looked refreshed and in high spirits. Shen Qingqiu compared Luo Binghe’s appearance to his own sorry state and felt depressed. Even Yue Qingyuan noticed. When the sect master approached, he looked at Shen Qingqiu for a while and said worriedly, “You look horrible. I shouldn’t have let you come.” Shen Qingqiu forced himself to smile: “It’s just that Mu Qingfang’s patients kept me awake last night with their crying and wailing.” When Mu Qingfang returned from distributing the pills, he was also surprised. “Senior apprentice brother, how could that be? No matter how much noise I made over there, you couldn’t have become like this overnight. Did you take the medicine I put in your room?” Shen Qingqiu said brusquely: “I took it. I took it.” Don’t ask me to take any more medicine today! There was a sudden racket at the other end of the square. Sheng Qingqiu turned his head to look then suddenly felt the urge to put a hand on his forehead. He saw a middle-aged man in mourning clothes leading a large group of men and women to kneel in front of Luo Binghe. It was the lord of Jinlan City. He was beside himself with excitement: “The immortals sacrificed their lives to save this insignificant little city! There’s no way that we could ever repay your grace. In the future, if there’s ever anything you need, we will do iteven if we have to die for it!” The corners of Shen Qingqiu’s twitched. This was truly the standard novel plot. After capturing all of the demons, the protagonist collects followers and the rewards. At this time, the protagonist alone steals the spotlight, while the rest who helped are regarded as mere background scenery. Even if Shen Qingqiu himself didn’t contribute much, two of the demons had been caught by Liu Qinggeand what about Mu Qingfang who had been totally focused on distributing medicine just now? Luo Binghe’s response was also in line with the usual plot. He said modestly: “City Lord, please, you do me too much honor. Jinlan City survived this disaster thanks to the concerted efforts of cultivators from different sects. It wasn’t accomplished due to one man’s efforts.” He spoke and behaved with sincerity and propriety, without upsetting other people. He himself didn’t lose face, but the other sects were also placated. The City Lord once again burst out with more compliments: “Last night, with my own eyes I saw this young lord capture those sinister demons. What an outstanding sight! Truly a young hero! A great teacher produces an outstanding disciple! Old Palace Master, your lordship’s successor is undoubtedly well- qualified.” When Luo Binghe heard the words “a great teacher produces an outstanding disciple,” his smile deepened and, perhaps unintentionally, his gaze flittered to someone. For one fleeting moment, his gaze landed on Shen Qingqiu’s face as lightly as a dragonfly touching water 127 , but the latter spread his fan to avoid his gaze. The leader of Huan Hua Palace looked at Luo Binghe with admiration and fatherly affection in his eyes. Other people may not understand the meaning of that fond gaze but Shen Qingqiu knew very well that this was the proud look of a teacher looking at his future successor + son-in-law. The seven so-called sowers who were surrounded by a group of cultivators were shouting cruel comments quite noisily, making the crowd anxious. Someone asked: “How should we handle these dirty things?” Yue Qingyuan said: “Junior apprentice brother, do you have any ideas?” Shen Qingqiu muttered to himself irresolutely: “Qingqiu has read some ancient books related to this matter. The sowers are afraid of high temperatures. It seems that fire can burn away the corrosive quality of their bodies.” Everyone understood that he meant that disinfection must be carried out at high temperatures. A shocked cultivator exclaimed: “This… even if it is feasible,how can such a method that is as brutal and cruel as the demons’ be used?” His voice was quickly drowned out by the angry shouting of Jinlan City’s surviving citizens. In the days when the plague was rampant, countless innocent lives were lost and there was the ever-present spectacle, too horrible to endure, of the infected victims’ bodies rotting away. A wealthy and bustling center of commerce had become a deserted ghost town. Therefore, expressing sympathy towards the sowers or upholding humanitarian principles on their behalf was unacceptable to the Jinlan City survivors. The monks were quickly surrounded by many people shouting “burn them!” and “anyone who objects should also be burned!” Most of the seven sowers inside the enchanted barrier were baring their fangs and smiling cruelly, not showing any fear or weakness. Sheng Qingqiu figured that they probably considered themselves heroes who created a good harvest for the sake of the demon race. Only the smallest sower was weeping disconsolately. Upon seeing it, some people began to sympathize. Qin Wanyue bit her lip and approached Luo Binghe: “Senior apprentice brother Luo, that little sower looks pitiful.” “They look pitiful”alas, where is the pity for those who contracted a mysterious plague, suffered, and died? Luo Binghe smiled at her but didn’t answer. In Shen Qingqiu’s opinion, Luo Binghe’s reaction to the girl was really perfunctory. It could be considered a failure! Based on the original novel’s content, shouldn’t he take this opportunity to warmly express his feelings to her at this time? Has Luo Binghe improved his leveling up speed at the cost of his harem master skills 128 ? How could she deal with her family’s head disciple whose face, no matter from which angle one viewed it, always looked gentle as jade, confident, relaxed, and elegant? Qin Wanyue was dazzled. Forgetting the words she had just said, she was content to watch the crowd. It was then that something far more unexpected occurred. The little sower leaped up and slammed into the edge of the barrier. Its scarlet face became more and more ferocious because of its howling. It shouted, “Immortal Master Shen, don’t let them burn me to death. I beg you, Immortal Master Shen, please save me!” In that instant, Shen Qingqiu felt as though something in his brain hadsnapped. … Who are you? How can you casually approach and call me Immortal Master Shen when I don’t even know you? From all over the square, thousands of eyes turned to Shen Qingqiu. The sower continued to wail: “All we did was listen to your instructions but we never agreed to be burned to death!” What the fuck! What a simple and crude accusation! What kind of godly plot development is this? Shen Qingqiu felt like he needed a drink. What made him crave a drink and the comfort of intoxication even more was the Old Palace Master’s words: “The words that came out of this thing’s mouth, shouldn’t Immortal Master Shen explain them?” Such a low-level technique and there was a person who actually believed it? Immediately someone else echoed: “Yes! Give us an explanation.” And there was more than one person! The twelve peaks were always banded together in solidarity in the face of outside threats. When these accusations were made, many Cang Qiong Mountain sect cultivators’ faces became angry. Yue Qingyuan’s expression turned cold. Qi Qingqi scoffed: “Anyone with a brain can see that this thing isn’t reconciled to dying alone and wants to bring down someone to share its fate. It’s simply trying to frame him! Demons are all the same, they have no moral integrity. How could people take the bait like this? Don’t make me laugh, this is ridiculous!” Old Palace Master said softly: “Why doesn’t it falsely accuse others? It singled out Immortal Master Shen. It’s worthwhile to think about that.” Shen Qingqiu was overwhelmed by his logic. Based on this type of thinking, so long as a person was singled out, others would need to think carefully about whether or not that person was innocent. The cost of framing people was also sufficiently low. Luo Binghe didn’t say a word, staring at the scene with rapt attention. Maybe it was just his imagination, but Shen Qingqiu always felt that his pitch- black eyes were like stars, and his smiling expression was full of satisfaction. In the original novel, Shen Qingqiu was hated because of his unforgivable crime of murdering his own sect brother, killing Liu Qingge with his own hands.But now, Liu Qingge was standing beside him. If anyone tried to beat Shen Qingqiu up, perhaps Liu Qingge would protect him. That charge won’t hold water! Could it be that since the stain on his reputation wasn’t big enough, false accusations will pool together until his reputation is sufficiently tarnished? Based on Luo Binghe’s character after he blackened… it’s not unthinkable. Suddenly, a Huan Hua Palace disciple with a pockmarked face stood up. It was the disciple who had sneered at Shen Qingqiu in the abandoned building that day. He bowed and said: “Palace Master, this disciple discovered something but didn’t know whether it would be inappropriate to speak.” Shen Qingqiu face was expressionless as he said: “You say you ‘didn’t know whether it would be inappropriate to speak’ yet you’ve already spoken. Isn’t it hypocritical to say that?” As a matter of fact, isn’t this the same as slapping yourself on the face? The disciple probably hadn’t expected that a senior cultivator would scold him. His face changed colors to red then white until the pockmarks on his face stood out, but he dared not scold him back. He had no alternative but to glare at Shen Qingqiu ferociously, saying: “Yesterday, this disciple and a few senior apprentice brothers and sisters saw that there were some marks of the sowers’ infection on Elder Shen’s arm. We all saw it, but today those marks have already completely disappeared!” “Cang Qiong Mountain sect sent Senior Mu to announce that the pills that were distributed in the city were created in a rush. It takes the pills twenty-four hours to take effect and they might not even work. Senior apprentice brother Luo took the pill in front of us, but the marks of infection on him have not disappeared. How come only Elder Shen has recovered so fast that the marks of his infection have faded? In any case, this disciple thought this point was very suspicious.” Shen Qingqiu silently sighed in his heart. He should have known that Luo Binghe wouldn’t be so kind as to remove the infection out of the goodness of his heart. Yue Qingyuan spoke in a calm and measured way: “My junior apprentice brother is in charge of Qing Jing Peak. As a Peak Lord, he has always been a good role model, a person of noble and unblemished moral character. In the sect, everyone knows everything, we do not keep secrets from each other. You are too easily provoked by such credulous nonsense.”Even though Shen Qingqiu was thick-skinned, his face was about to turn red. Senior apprentice brother, don’t say that! Are you serious? If you must act against your conscience this much in order to speak up and protect me, I’ll really feel bad about it! Whether it’s the original or the current Shen Qingqiu, neither one of them could possibly touch even the edges of the phrase “noble and unblemished moral character.” Oh no, the original character can touch the third word. The Old Palace Master said, “Really? That’s quite different from what I heard.” Shen Qingqiu’s heart sank. It seems that today he has to be dragged down into the gutter."
"沈清秋眯眼道： “ 苍穹山十二峰传人品性究竟如何 , 不知什么时候居然要别派靠道听途说来 下定论了。 ” 老宫主道： “ 若是道听途说 , 那自然不敢轻信。只不过 , 这话正是从贵派门人之中流传开来 的。 ” 他环顾四周 , 继续说道： “ 诸位应知 , 各派弟子们私底下交好 , 也是常事，难免有些流言蜚语 入耳。单单是沈峰主刻意打压残害座下弟子一事，就担不起 ‘ 品行高洁 ’ 一词。 ” 沈清秋一听头都大了。 残害座下弟子？ 这倒真是大实话。光是在洛冰河正值发育的时期 , 沈清秋对他百般虐待、当成童工用等这 些光辉往迹都能单独写一本苦情小说。其余因为资质上佳而被沈清秋刁难甚至逐出师门的 弟子也可以组一个体操团了。只不过 , 动手残害的不是他，是原装货啊！ 岳清源肃然道： “ 既然知道是流言蜚语，多说无益。师弟平素固然不喜对肚子嘘寒问暖 , 但 要说残害 , 也未免太过了。 ” 忽然，一个娇柔的声音响起来。秦婉约终于忍不住，要为心上人说话了： “ 那小女子斗胆 问一句岳掌门，命令一个十几岁的少年，直面迎战拥有百年功力、身穿毒刺铠甲的魔族长 老，这算不算迫害残害？ ” 这次，沈清秋可不能做一个安静的美男子干听着了。 他不咸不淡地道： “ 这算不算，我不知道。可我知道的是，如果一个师父在毒刺铠甲之前 ，把徒弟拍了出去，自己挡在身前，这大约不能算迫害。你觉得呢，洛冰河？ ” 在场众修士，有些听到这个名字，脸现诧异之色。这其中又以苍穹山派为多。有些原本见 到这张脸只是怀疑的，比如齐清萋，现在也震惊了。至于某个刚进金兰城和洛冰河打了个 照面就差点直接跪了的后勤一把手，一颗心脏雨打风吹过后，现在反而淡定了。 人群之中，洛冰河凝视着沈清秋，目光定定。沈清秋歪了歪头，展开折扇，居然有心思对 之报以一笑。虽然看起来只是很嘲讽地勾了勾嘴角。 说他一点儿也不生气，那是鬼扯。沈清秋固然时时顾虑到自己小命，总对洛冰河想法颇多 ，可那时候帮洛冰河挡了一击，却是自发而动，虽然洛冰河可能并不需要别人来帮他化解 危机。怎么想，三场比斗坑得最狠的那个人就是他，这件事居然也能用来泼脏水，沈清秋 怒了。 继续高冷下去，不如主动迎击！ 因沈清秋以前时常责罚洛冰河，岳清源也见过他几次，可那也只是在洛冰河年纪尚幼的时 候。后来沈清秋开始重用洛冰河，他便常常被派下清静峰处理各种事宜，更难见面。仙盟 大会里，倒是在晶石镜里看过洛冰河的脸，可只有短短一瞬，而且镜面不算清晰，是以刚 才一路，竟没认出幻花宫宫主身旁这个丰神俊朗的青年居然就是当年沈清秋 “ 爱徒 ” 。此前 ，岳清源听说宫主最器重的是他小弟子，于是一直把洛冰河当成了公仪萧。这时看沈清秋 目光锁定的方向，愕然： “ 师弟，你叫他什么？ ” 沈清秋尚未回答，洛冰河居然先给出了反应。 他缓缓道： “ 师尊以身相护之恩，永不敢忘。 ” 齐清萋不可置信道： “ 真是你？沈清秋，你不是说他死了吗？ ” 又看着洛冰河： “ 既然活着 ，为何不回清静峰来？你知不知道，你师尊因为你 ……” 沈清秋猛地一阵干咳，咳得齐清萋不得不停下来瞪着他。 沈清秋也暗暗瞪回去。他有预感，接下来绝对又会听到 “ 失魂落魄 ” 这个词，妈蛋他一点都 不想再听到这个词了！一阵鸡皮疙瘩，让洛冰河听了还不笑裂那张标准男主脸！ 老宫主阴魂不散道： “ 正是这一点，叫人百思不得其解。为何明明没死的，却非要说是死 了？而为何明明可以回去，却不愿回去？ ” 沈清秋烦透了他这阴阳怪气的调调，不咸不淡道： “ 他不愿意回来，我也没办法。来则安 之，去则由之，随他好了。宫主若是想说什么，请直说。 ” 老宫主笑了笑： “ 我想说什么，沈峰主自己心中清楚，在场但凡心思清明的，也都能领 会。这些魔族撒种人固然该受烈火焚噬，可如果有幕后指使、推波助澜之人，也绝不应该 放过。无论如何，总要给整座金兰城一个交待。 ” 他一句话，成功挑起了在场金兰城幸存者的仇恨之火。刚刚渡过一场大灾，他们的此刻的 心情本来就惶恐憋屈，恨不得有活靶子来集中火力，发泄一番，不少人跟着叫嚣起来。 洛冰河道： “ 师尊嫉恶如仇，遇魔族只恨不能手刃之而后快，又怎会与之勾结？ ” 沈清秋侧目凝视他。恐怕在场的，只有他能切身领会，洛冰河那句 “ 手刃之而后快 ” 里包含 的真实意味。 破罐子破摔，沈清秋干脆挑开了明问： “ 洛冰河，你现在究竟是算清静峰的弟子，还是算 幻花宫的门人？ ” 老宫主冷笑道： “ 事到如今，沈峰主又肯认这徒弟了？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 我可从没把他逐出师门过。他既然还肯叫我一声师尊，想必是愿意承认的。 ” 他这句话，纯粹是抱着膈应一下洛冰河的心态说出来的，结果好像没膈应到，洛冰河目光 闪动，不知是否错觉，似乎眼神稍霁。 一时间，两大阵营对立分明，空气中仿佛火花碰撞，充满剑拔弩张的味道。至于一开始引 发这场战争的撒种人，倒被遗忘在一旁，没人关心该怎么处置了。 忽然，有个娇媚的女声道： “ 沈九？ …… 你是不是沈九？ ” 一听到这个名字，沈清秋脸上的云淡风轻险些裂成东非大裂谷。 靠靠靠！ 今天难道注定是天要亡我？！ 死定了。是这个女人。是秋海棠！ 原作之中，秋海棠的出现，只标志着一件事。那就是沈清秋的身败名裂。 秋海棠虽然已经不是青春少女，但脸蛋白皙如玉兰，妆容艳丽，加之身量苗条胸部丰满， 姿色实在不俗。既然姿色不俗，那么自然也不能逃过成为洛冰河后宫一员的宿命。 坏就坏在，她和沈清秋曾经有过一腿。 恭喜！跟一篇种马文男主的两个老婆都有说不清道不明的关系，原装沈清秋也算是前无古 人了！ 至少在沈垣看过的所有种马文里，是再找不出第二个的！ 可想而知，这一定就是当初在读者评论又轰轰烈烈开起了第二栋 “ 求阉沈清秋！不阉打负 分！ ” 高楼的渊源。 沈清秋心中 “ 卧槽擦擦擦 xn” 地刷过了满屏惊涛骇浪的弹幕，那边秋海棠横剑于胸前，一副 大不了杀了他再自刎的架势： “ 我在问你话！你为什么不敢看我？ ” 大姐我哪敢看你啊？！你是来要我的命的！ 秋海棠满面凄艳： “ 我就说，怪不得，怪不得我找了这许多年，也再没见过你。原来，原 来你早就飞上枝头，成了高高在上的清静峰主人。哈哈，好风光啊！ ” 沈清秋实在不知道该看哪儿，该说什么，于是平视前方，尽量让面部表情淡漠疏离。 众人都在窃窃私语。岳清源道： “ 清秋，怎么回事？这位姑娘与你是旧识吗？ ” 师兄 …… 别问了 …… 那边秋海棠又凄然道： “ 旧识？岂止是旧识 …… 我与这个道貌岸然的男人，自幼青梅竹马 …… 我是他的妻！ ” 闻言，洛冰河挑了挑眉。 不是！ 你明明是洛冰河的妻！快醒醒！ 尚清华大大的惊讶道： “ 咦？此话当真？怎么从未听沈师兄提到过？ ” 沈清秋朝他扯扯嘴角，送个假笑：能别火上浇油吗？ 这段给他刷人渣值仇恨值的狗血内容是谁编的啊还好意思在那边看戏！ 还有旁边那些不都是修仙之人吗哪这么多爱看八卦的，都散了散了滚滚滚！ 秋海棠冷笑道： “ 这种衣冠禽兽，自然不敢提亏心之事。 ” 无尘大师和苍穹山三人相处一段时间，受沈清秋照料过，对他颇有好感，刚才苍穹山派与 幻花宫争执，没能插上话，这时开口道： “ 阿弥陀佛，这位女施主若有什么话，大可好好 说，说个透彻明白，一味指责，却不能叫人信服。 ” 沈清秋心中泪流满面：大师 …… 我知道你是为我好，可她说个透彻明白我才虐啊 …… 真是 不做亏心事，也怕鬼敲门！ 秋海棠此刻俨然成了众人瞩目的焦点。她激动得脸色泛出潮红，挺起胸膛，大声道： “ 我 秋海棠以下所说之话，如果有半句虚言，叫我受魔族毒箭万箭穿心、不得好死！ ” 她直直 指着沈清秋，眼中怒火中烧道： “ 此人现在是苍穹山派清静峰峰主沈清秋，声名远扬的修 雅剑。可有谁知道，他曾经是一个什么东西！ ” 她说的略难听，齐清萋柳眉倒竖： “ 注意你的用词！ ” 秋海棠现在是个杂门小派的什么什么堂主，被苍穹山这种巨头组织首脑之一一斥责，倒退 了一步。 老宫主却道： “ 齐峰主何必动气，就让这位姑娘说下去，有何不可？总不能堵住人嘴。 ” 秋海棠咬了咬牙，眼中恨意盖过了惧意，声音又高了起来： “ 他十二岁时，不过是我家从 外地人贩子手里买来的一个小奴，因为是第九个，就叫小九，我父母看他被人贩子虐待， 很是可怜，就带回家中，教他念书识字，供他吃穿用度，饱暖无忧。我兄弟也带他极为亲 厚，长到十五岁，父母去世，我哥哥当家作主，给他脱了奴籍，还认作义弟。而我，因为 同他一起长大，受了他的蒙骗 …… 居然真的以为 …… 我们是两情相悦 …… 因而订下了婚 约。 ” 沈清秋就站在这里，被迫和上千个人一起听 “ 自己 ” 的黑历史，心中千言万语，都化作 “ 无 语” 两个字。 她眼中开始泛起泪花涟涟： “ 我兄长十九岁那年，城中来了一名云游修士，看中此地灵气 养人，在城门设立法坛，十八岁以下的青年男女都可以前去试灵，他要挑一名天资出众者 收作弟子。那修士身怀仙术，城中人无一不惊叹赞服，沈九也去了试灵坛，他资质不错， 被那修士相中，他欢天喜地跑回来，要离开我家。 ” “ 我哥哥当然不同意。在他眼里，修仙之事，纯属渺茫，况且他已与我订下婚约之事，怎 可忽然弃家离去？他和我哥哥大吵一架，当时郁郁寡欢，我们只当他一时想不开，等想明 白后，自然就接受了。 ” 她脸色陡变： “ 谁知道，就在当晚，他凶相毕露，居然丧心病狂，将我哥哥和数名家仆一 并杀死，横尸府中，连夜跟着那修士逃遁出城！ “ 我家经此一变，我一个弱女子，无力支撑，偌大家业，就这么散了。我苦苦寻了这丑人 多少年，一直不得踪迹。当年收他为徒的那名修士，早就死于非命，从此更是断了线索 …… 如果不是今天到金兰城来了一遭，恐怕我这辈子都不知道，这个忘恩负义手刃恩人的 小人，居然一路往上爬，爬到了天下第一大派的峰主之一的位置！虽然他跟以往已大不相 同…… 可这张脸、这张脸就算化为灰烬我也绝不会认错！ ” 众人唏嘘抽气声中，沈清秋不知怎么的，居然反而冷静下来了。 秋海棠叙述的这段经历，乍一听跌宕起伏，可细细分辨，漏洞不少。 并不是沈清秋歧视原装货，而是原著从来就致力于表现，沈清秋是个不讨人喜欢的个性， 臭硬，心眼小，不会说话，不会讨好，高冷，装 b 。这样的性格，很难让人相信，少年时 期的沈清秋会可爱到让毫无血缘关系者把他当亲人看待。 可是对于旁人而言，他们才捕捉不到这种细节。 原先，沈清秋忌惮是忌惮这一段剧情，可也不是非常忌惮。这种陈年旧事，有没有确切证 据，单凭秋海棠，只要他死咬不认，让秋海棠以为自己认错了人，无非是在沈清秋此人人 品履历上抹一个大大污点。 没办法，沈清秋的确对不起秋海棠，但那是原装沈清秋！他才不想背这个黑锅！他宁可日 后在别的方面好好补偿秋海棠。他没杀柳清歌，没猥亵宁婴婴，怎样也不至于百丈高楼一 夜塌，混到人人喊打的地步。 可现在就不一样了。 有撒种人指控在前，老宫主指控在后，现在秋海棠的控诉，完全可以作为他人品不端的佐 证，始乱终弃的渣男 + 勾结魔族的内奸，简直标准配置，锦上添花。 巧合完美契合堆积，还叫它巧合，未免太自欺欺人了。 老宫主道： “ 岳掌门，处理这种事，徇私可要不得。否则传出去苍穹山派泱泱大派包庇一 个劣迹斑斑之人，怎能服众？ ” 岳清源木然道： “ 所以宫主的意思是？ ” “ 依我看，暂时把沈仙师安置在幻花宫，等查明真相再做定夺如何？ ” 谁都知道，这个 “ 处置 ” ，究竟是什么意思。 幻花宫有一个特殊的功能。在它行宫坐落之处的地底，有一座水牢。地形复杂，辅以幻花 宫迷阵，这个压箱底的阵法可跟那种只用来挡挡非修真人士的护宫阵法不是一个等级的。 水牢内部更是戒备森严，刑堂设备齐全，专业无比。关押其中的，无一不是修真界罪大恶 极、双手染血、或者触犯禁例的修士。 简而言之，幻花宫水牢，就是修真界的公共监狱。 除此之外，如果有危害人界嫌疑的修士，暂时需要一个地方收押待审，也会被遣送到此， 等待四派联合公审，再作发落。 柳清歌冷笑道： “ 说够了？ ” 耐着性子听了这么久的废话，他心里早就窝火了，反手握住背后乘鸾剑，一副开打的架 势。对面幻花宫弟子也纷纷挺剑而出，怒目相对。 岳清源道： “ 柳师弟退下。 ” 柳清歌虽不情不愿，但若说非要听一个人的话，他也只服气岳清源，勉强把手从剑柄上撤 开。 见他退了回去，岳清源点头道： “ 这种指控，可不是说说就能算的。 ” 他腰间那柄通体墨黑的长剑突然从鞘中弹出一寸雪白刺眼的锋芒 刹那间，整个广场上方，仿佛撒下一张无形巨网，网内的灵力波动如海潮般卷涌不息。 剑鸣之声仿佛就在耳朵里嗡鸣不止，较为年轻的弟子为数不少都不自觉捂住了耳朵，心脏 狂跳不止。 玄肃剑！ 沈清秋实在想不到，岳清源令柳清歌退下，原来是要自己上阵啊？！真是毁三观！ 据说，苍穹山穹顶峰主人岳清源自接任以来，只拔过两次剑。一次是接任仪式，一次是迎 战天魔血统后裔（洛冰河他爹）。 玄肃剑只出鞘了一寸，就让众人忽然有些明白了。 能坐在穹顶殿的最高处，绝不是只要沉稳就行的！ 老宫主道： “ 摆阵！ ” 这是要迎战的节奏？！ 究竟怎么回事，魔界都还没打过来呢，人倒先自己斗起来了。沈清秋见势不对，忙摘下佩 剑，往前一扔。 修雅剑直直插到了幻花宫宫主身前。 弃剑等同于投降。老宫主一怔，摆手让门人归位。 岳清源低声道： “ 师弟！ ” 沈清秋道： “ 师兄，不用再多说，清者自清。清秋愿意受缚。 ” 这老宫主看来就跟个老糊涂蛋似的，死咬他不放，再加上撒种人和秋海棠二连击，他哪会 放过这么好的机会。反正是板上钉钉的事，没必要害苍穹山派和幻花宫两大巨头撕破脸 皮。沈清秋坚持道： “ 多说无益。自证为上。 ” 他说完没看岳清源表情如何，而是扫了一眼洛冰河。 他脸上看不出喜怒，稳立原地，和四周捂耳眩晕的修士们形成鲜明对比。 半晌，岳清源终于收剑。空气中，仿佛被撤去了一张无形巨网。 沈清秋转向岳清源深深一礼。说起来，给这掌门添的麻烦不可谓不多，实在汗颜。 秋海棠仍啜泣不止。秦婉约走过她时，安慰道： “ 秋姑娘，无论事情如何，三派总会给你 一个交待。 ” 秋海棠神情激动，两眼含泪，抬头道谢，见洛冰河伫立一旁，双颊不由生晕。 瞎狗眼啦又来！沈清秋暗暗翻个白眼。说起来他这也算是被当面 ntr 了，为何他一点不快 都没有！ 以公仪萧为首的几名幻花宫弟子走上前来，手里拿的东西十分眼熟。 你好捆仙索；再见捆仙索！ 公仪萧语带歉意道： “ 沈前辈，得罪了。晚辈定当以礼相待，事情水落石出，决不让前辈 受半分怠慢。 ” 沈清秋点头，只说了两个字： “ 有劳。 ” 光是你以礼相待有什么用。看看现场幻花宫众弟子的眼神，个个恨不得生吃了他，毕竟当 初仙盟大会死伤最惨的就是幻花宫了，可有的罪受了。 捆仙索五花大绑一上身，沈清秋就觉得身体沉重了不少。之前 “ 无可解 ” 毒性发作断断续续 ，灵流只会感觉到堵塞，就像接触不良，摔摔砸砸遥控器偶尔也还能支撑一下。捆仙索一 上身，那就是彻底阻隔，仿佛忽然被贬成 * 凡胎。 老宫主道： “ 公审之期，就定在一个月之后，诸位意下如何？ ” 柳清歌道： “ 五天。 ” 在水牢里关得越久，零碎苦头吃得越多，柳清歌说五天，那就是把公审一切预备流程压缩 到最短。老宫主当然不肯妥协： “ 如此仓促，恐怕多有疏漏。 ” 昭华寺专业和事佬，一位方丈提议道： “ 那不如十天？ ” 岳清源道： “ 七天。不能再拖。 ” 一群掌门在那里讨价还价，沈清秋现在居然还有心情觉得喜感，想到一事，忙道： “ 不必 多说。听宫主安排。一个月。 ” 能拖久一点，反而对露芝成长有利。他眼角瞥向一旁尚清华，动了动眉毛。 尚清华心领神会，双手在身前下垂，暗暗比了个 “ 没问题，交给我 ” 的手势。 只不过，但愿他真的能在洛冰河一手遮天的幻花宫里，撑过这一个月！","CHAPTER 36: BLACKENED REPUTATION PART 2 Shen Qingqiu narrowed his eyes and said, “As for what Cang Qiong Mountain Sect Qing Jing Peak successor’s character may be like, since when did other sects start jumping to conclusions based on a mere rumor?” The old palace master said, “If it were just rumor and hearsay, then naturally we wouldn’t have believed it so easily. It’s just that these words were spread precisely from people of your respectable sect.” He surveyed his surroundings and continued, “Everyone here knows and would agree that it is common for disciples to have good relations with one another. It is also inevitable for some gossip and slander to spread. It’s only this matter of Peak Lord Shen deliberately suppressing how he beat and harmed his disciples, which makes him unworthy of being described as “a noble and unblemished moral character.” Upon hearing this, Shen Qingqiu was incredulous. Harming his disciples? That was indeed the truth. When Luo Binghe was growing up, Shen Qingqiu would abuse him in every possible way, using him for child labor and the like. All those bygone days could be written into a tragedy novel of its own. As for the rest of the disciples who were outstanding enough to be picked on, treated harshly, or evicted by Shen Qingqiu… they were so numerous they could form their own gymnastics team. Only, the perpetrator of this cruel treatment wasn’t him, but the original goods! Yue Qingyuan said solemnly, “Since you know they were just rumor and hearsay, then how can you not know there’s no benefit in dwelling on the subject? Admittedly, my younger sect brother does not habitually pamper his disciples, but to say he abuses them is crossing the line.” Suddenly, a tender voice spoke up. Qin Wanyue could no longer resist the need to speak up for her crush: “If my humble self may be so bold to ask Sect Leader Yue… Ordering a teenage youth to fight against a demonic sect elder with hundreds of years of experience and armor bristling with poisoned spikes could this not be counted as persecution and abuse?” This time, Shen Qingqiu could not continue to stand by like a quiet wallflower. Neither spiteful nor mild, he said, “Whether it is or not, I don’t know. But what I do know is, if a master pushed their disciple out of the way of the poisoned spike armor and blocked it with his own body, this probably can’t becounted as persecution. What do you think, Luo Binghe?” Hearing this name, the faces of many cultivators present flickered in astonishment, especially those from Cang Qiong Mountain sect. Some had originally held some suspicions upon seeing his face, such as Qi Qingqi, and were now shocked by the reveal. As for those group leaders who had only just arrived at Jinlan City and been brought to their knees upon meeting Luo Binghe… they had already weathered the hail and storm and were now, in fact, calm and collected. In the past, because Shen Qingqiu frequently punished Luo Binghe, Yue Qingyuan had also seen Luo Binghe a few times, but that was during Luo Binghe’s youth. Later, when Shen Qingqiu started putting Luo Binghe to good use, he would often be absent from Qing Jing Peak running various errands, making it even harder to meet him. During the Immortal Alliance Conference, he’d glimpsed Luo Binghe’s face in the crystal mirror, but only for a brief moment and through the mirror’s murky surface no less. Thus, this whole time he had not recognized that this handsome, commanding youth beside Huan Hua Palace’s Palace Master was, in fact, Shen Qingqiu’s “dearest disciple” from back then. Before this, Yue Qingyuan had heard that the Palace Master thought highly of his most senior disciple, so he had mistaken Luo Binghe for Gongyi Xiao this entire time. Now with Shen Qingqiu revealing this, he was also stunned. Amongst the crowd, Luo Binghe stared at Shen Qingqiu, gaze fixed. Shen Qingqiu tilted his head, spread open his folding fan, and unexpectedly had the impulse to return a smilethough, the small curl of his lips probably would have been seen as a taunt or provocation. To say he wasn’t angry at all was bullshit. Shen Qingqiu admittedly often worried about his own small life, so he was always overthinking everything when it came to Luo Binghe. But when he blocked that attack for Luo Binghe, he was acting on his own instinct. … although Luo Binghe probably didn’t need any help from others to solve the crisis. No matter how you looked at it, in the three rounds of fighting, the person who had suffered the most damage was him. To go so far as to use even this matter to slander him (drench him in dirty water) incensed Shen Qingqiu. Luo Binghe said slowly, “Shizun placed his life on the line to protect me; this grace I will never forget.” Qi Qingqi incredulously said, “It’s really you? Shen Qingqiu, didn’t you say he died?” She looked at Luo Binghe again. “Since you’re alive, why didn’t you return to Qing Jing Peak? Don’t you know, for your sake, your Shizun wasdistracted…” Shen Qingqiu burst into a fit of dry coughing, distracting enough that Qi Qingqi had no choice but to stop and glare at him. Shen Qingqiu wanted to bow to her. He had a premonition that her next words would be “distracted like he lost his soul.” He never wanted to hear those fucked words again! A sudden rush of goosebumps rose on his skin. If Luo Binghe heard this, he would laugh so hard his perfect male protagonist face would crack! The old palace master persisted on the subject. “That’s precisely the point that puzzles people the most. He clearly didn’t die, so why insist he’s dead? And why is it that he clearly could return, but isn’t willing to?” Shen Qingqiu was thoroughly annoyed by his insinuating tone. “If he isn’t willing to return, then I can’t do anything about it. He comes peacefully, he leaves freely, however it pleases him. If the old palace master wants to say something, please say it straight.” The old palace master laughed. “What I want to say, Peak Lord Shen, you are already well aware. Those here with clear minds will also understand. These sower demons should be incinerated, but if there was someone operating behind the scenessomeone adding fuel to the firethey should not be spared. No matter what, all of Jinlan City is owed an explanation.” With just that, he succeeded in igniting the enmity of the Jinlan City survivors at the scene. They had just suffered through a big disaster; with their mood already sullen and terrified, they were itching for a target to take their anger out on. Quite a few people responded with hooting and jeering. Luo Binghe said, “Shizun abhors evil. When it comes to demons, he can’t help but kill them on sight and rejoice afterward. How could he collude with them?” These words seemed to absolve Shen Qingqiu of wrongdoing, except, of those present, only he could understand the hidden meaning behind the words “couldn’t help but kill them on sight and rejoice afterward.” Now that the cat was out of the bag, Shen Qingqiu might as well come out with it and ask: “Luo Binghe, right now are you a disciple of Qing Jing Peak or a member of Huan Hua Palace?” The old palace master sneered. “After all this, Peak Lord Shen, you’re willing to recognize this disciple of yours again?” Shen Qingqiu said, “I never evicted him from the sect. If he is still calling me Shizun, I assume he’s willing to be recognized as my disciple.”His words were said purely to annoy Luo Binghe’s psyche; however, it seemed he didn’t succeed. Luo Binghe’s eyes flickered. Shen Qingqiu didn’t know if it was his imagination, but the expression in Luo Binghe’s eyes appeared to clear. In a moment, the two opposing factions were clearstanding opposite one another, distinctly separated. It was as if sparks collided, emitting an aura of hostilityswords drawn, bows bent. As for the sower demon who had triggered this conflict, he was forgotten to one side. No one cared to deal with him. Suddenly, a coquettish female voice asked, “Shen Jiu? Are you Shen Jiu?” As soon as he heard this name, Shen Qingqiu’s unperturbed countenance was almost cracked into the Great African rift valley. To hell with it all! Is it heaven’s intention to kill me today? It’s over. It’s this woman. It’s Qiu Haitang! In the original work, Qiu Haitang’s appearance signified only one thing: Shen Qingqiu’s complete fall from grace. Though Qiu Haitang was no longer a young girl in the spring of her life, her face was as fair as a magnolia, painted gorgeously with makeup. Her body was slim, her bosom ampleher appearance was truly extraordinary. And because her appearance was extraordinary, she naturally could not escape the fate of becoming part of Luo Binghe’s harem. The problem was, she once had a relationship with Shen Qingqiu. Congratulations! To be involved in ambiguous relationships with two wives of a stallion novel protagonist, the original Shen Qingqiu was truly one of a kind! At least from all the stallion novels Shen Yuan had read, he couldn’t find a second such character! But thinking back, this revelation must have been the thing that sparked the second wave of the readers’ comments saying “Cut off Shen Qingqiu’s ‘family jewels’! If you don’t, I’ll quit reading!” Shen Qingqiu’s heart broke into a barrage of endless “shit, fuck…” in response to this perilous situation. Qiu Haitang drew her sword and leveled it horizontally before her chest with an attitude of: if all comes to worst, she’d kill him then herself. “I am asking you a question! Why do you not dare to look at me?” Big sister, how can I dare look at you? You’re coming after my life! Qiu Haitang’s expression was full of sorrow. “I was saying it was nowonderno wonder I searched for so many years and never saw you again. It turns outturns out you had long reached a higher place in life and became this lofty Qing Jing Peak Lord. Ha ha, how impressive!” Shen Qingqiu truly didn’t know where to look or what to say. Consequently, he gazed steadily forward and did his best to school his expression into detached apathy. The crowd was whispering amongst each other. Yue Qingyuan whispered, “Qingqiu, this young lady and you… are truly old acquaintances?” Shen Qingqiu’s tears watered the fields of his heart. Shixiong… don’t ask… On that side, Qiu Haitang spoke again in a distressed tone: “Old acquaintances? Not only were we acquaintances, I and this sanctimonious man were childhood sweethearts… I’m his fiancée!” Hearing this, Luo Binghe’s brows twitched wildly. No! You’re obviously Luo Binghe’s wife! Hurry and wake up! Shang Qinghua exclaimed, “Huh? Is this true? How come I’ve never heard Shen Shixiong mention this before?” Shen Qingqiu pulled at the corner of his lips and gave him a fake smile: Could you please not add fuel to the fire? This melodramatic and hated part that painted him as a scum villain… who made it up again? And someone even had the nerve to stand there enjoying the show! And these bystanders, aren’t they cultivators? How come they all love watching gossip Everyone leave, leave, get out get out get out! Qiu Haitang gave a bitter smile. “This person is a beast in human form, a refined-looking scoundrel. Naturally, he doesn’t dare to mention things that would give him a guilty conscience.” Great Master Wu Chen had interacted with the three people of Cang Qiong sect for a period of time and received Shen Qingqiu’s care, so he had good feelings towards the latter. During Cang Qiong Mountain sect’s dispute with Huan Hua Palace, he didn’t have the opportunity to interject. This time, he opened his mouth and said, “A-mi-to-fo (merciful Buddha), whatever words this lady benefactor has to say, she should say them properly and clearly. Blind denouncements do not inspire trust.” Shen Qingqiu’s heart streamed with tears. Great Master… I know you’re doing this for my own good, but I’ll actually suffer if she speaks her wordsclearly. This truly is the saying “not frightened of doing a shameful deed, just afraid the ghost (consequences) will come knocking”! At this moment, Qiu Haitang became the focus of everyone’s attention. She was so excited that her face flushed. She puffed out her chest and shouted, “If there is half a phrase of a lie in the following words I, Qiu Haitang, will say… then let me be pierced by ten-thousand of the demons’ poisoned arrows and die a horrible death!” She pointed straight at Shen Qingqiu, flames of fury raging in her eyes. “This person right now is Cang Qiong Mountain Peak Lord Shen Qingqiu, the famous and reputed Xiu Ya sword. But no one knows what kind of thing he used to be!” Her words were rather offensive; Qi Qingqi’s elegant brows furrowed. “Watch your words!” Qiu Haitang right now was the hall master of some miscellaneous small sect. Reprimanded by one of the leaders of the large and influential Cang Qiong Mountain Sect, she subconsciously retreated a step. But the old palace master said, “Peak Lady Qi, there’s no need to be angry. Why not let this young lady finish speaking? You can’t block a person’s mouth, after all.” Qiu Haitang looked at him and gritted her teeth. The hatred in her eyes concealed the fear. Her voice rose again: “When he was twelve, he was nothing more than a slave my family bought from a foreign human trafficker. Because he was the ninth (Jiu), he was called little Jiu. My parents, seeing he was mistreated by the slave-dealer, really pitied him. They took him back home, taught him to recognize words and study, gave him the means for food and clothing until he was full and warm without any concerns. My brothers looked after him like a part of the family. When he was fifteen, my parents passed away and my elder brother became chief of the household. He removed the slave title from him and considered him as a foster-brother. As for me, because I grew up with him, I was deceived by him … going as far as to truly think… we complemented each other (we were each other’s sunshine) … and as a result, set up an engagement.” Shen Qingqiu was standing right there, forced to listen to “his own” black history along with several thousand other people. The countless unspoken words in his heart were completely changed into tearful silence. Tears surfaced in her eyes. “When my elder brother was nineteen, a wandering cultivator came into town and settled there because of its nurturing spiritual energy. At the town gate, he set up a platform where young girls and boys under the age of eighteen could come and test their spiritual prowess. He wanted to choose an outstanding talent to become his disciple. That cultivatorhad a body full of immortal techniquesnot a single townsperson didn’t exclaim with admiration and praise. Shen Jiu also went to the spirit testing platform. His aptitude was good so he was picked by that cultivator. Overjoyed, he ran home, wanting to leave my household.” “My older brother naturally didn’t agree. In his eyes, cultivating immortality was an affair full of uncertainty. Besides, he was already engaged with me, how could he suddenly abandon his home and leave? He got into a big argument with my brother. At that time he was morose and cheerless. We thought it was just a temporary moodwe waited for him to understand and naturally accept matters.” Her expression suddenly changed. “Who would have known, that very night, his true beastly nature would be revealed? He went berserk, killed my brother and many other household servantsthe corpses littered the grounds of our home. Under the cover of night, he left the town with that cultivator! “With this huge change in my family, I was only a weak little girl who was powerless to support the household. Such a big family and all the property destroyed. I painfully searched for this person (object of my grudge) for so many years, always without finding any trace of him. The cultivator who took him under his wing back then had long died a violent death. From then on, the trail was even more broken… If not for today’s chance coming to Jinlan City, I’m afraid that for my entire lifetime I would not have been able to know that this villain, who bit the hand that fed him and back-stabbed his benefactors… was somehow climbing up in the world this entire time, and even climbed up to the position of a Peak Lord of the biggest sect under heaven! Even though he’s very different from the past… but this face, this faceeven if it was turned to ash, I would never mistake it! I’m not afraid to name that cultivator who incited him to commit such a violent crime either. He was registered in the wanted list for many years, the one whose hands took innumerable livesWu Yanzi!” This Wu Yanzi could be said to be notorious, with countless criminal records. Suddenly bursting out that one of the twelve Peak Lords was one of his disciples, the crowd couldn’t help but be terrified. But amongst the wide expanse of gasps, Shen Qingqiu instead calmed down. His heart was actually faintly doubtful. At first glance, the experience Qiu Haitang relayed was full of eventful ups and downs. But it was not without its holes. It wasn’t that Shen Qingqiu discriminated against the original goods, but the original work had devoted lots of energy to Shen Qingqiu’s unpleasant personality: his repulsiveness and rigidity, narrow-mindedness and pettiness,impoliteness and lack of communication, inability to know how to win favors, aloofness, and vanity. This kind of personality made it hard to believe that the young Shen Qingqiu would be so lovable that a person with no blood relationship would see him as kin. But when others interpreted these words, they could not catch these details. Originally, Shen Qingqiu was most afraid of this part of the plot, but he was not extremely fearful. This kind of old event of bygone years didn’t have any definitive evidence. If the accusation relied solely on Qiu Haitang, he could convince Qiu Haitang that she recognized the wrong person as long as he bit fast and refused to confess. So in the end, it would just be a questionable, faint stain on Shen Qingqiu’s character vitae. There was no choice. Shen Qingqiu truly did feel sorry for Qiu Haitang, but that was the original Shen Qingqiu! He really didn’t want to carry this black pot (carry this blame)! He much preferred to make it up to Qiu Haitang using other means. He didn’t kill Liu Qingge, didn’t molest Ning Yingying. No matter what, this shouldn’t go as far as to make his “sturdy as a thousand foot tall building” reputation collapse in a single night, muddling his way until everyone yelled to beat him up. But right now it really was different. The situation was bad because all these questionable, insignificant stains had amassed together. First, the sowers’ control. Then, the Old Palace master following close behind. Now, Qiu Haitang’s accusations could actually become the proof for his improper character. A scum man abusing a woman and then throwing her away, a traitor colluding with the Demons, a disciple of a wanted criminal… it was like adding extra flowers to an already perfectly configured brocade. They were beautiful coincidences, each agreeing with the other. As a result, people wouldn’t find them to be mere coincidences anymore. The Old Palace Master said, “Sect Master Yue, when taking care of these affairs, being swayed by personal convictions is unacceptable. Otherwise, if word gets out that this grand magnificent Cang Qiong Mountain sect covered up a person whose record is full of notorious stains… How can this be an outcome that’ll satisfy everyone?” Yue Qingyuan’s tone was indifferent. “So the Palace Master means…?” “In my opinion, it would be best to have Shen Qingqiu relocated to Huan Hua Palace for the time being. Wait until we’ve ascertained the truth before wecome to a decisionhow about it?” Everyone knew the true meaning of “relocated.” Beneath one of Huan Hua Palace’s temporary imperial residences lay an underground water prison. With complex terrain, coupled with Huan Hua Palace’s Labyrinth Formation, this “shoving to the bottom of the trunk” kind of method was not on the same level as those protective arrays only used to stop non-cultivators. The interior of the water prison was densely guarded, the equipment of the torture chambers comprehensive, specialized without compare. All those imprisoned inside were the cultivation world’s most heinous and reprehensible cultivators, their hands having been stained with blood or having violated prohibitions. To put it briefly, Huan Hua Palace’s water prison was the cultivation world’s public prison. Apart from this, if a place was needed to temporarily keep custody of cultivators suspected of endangering the human world while they were investigated, those cultivators would also be sent to this place. After the four sects held a joint trial, the punishment would then be meted out. Liu Qingge sneered. “Said enough?” After he had controlled his temper to listen to this nonsense for so long, his heart had long harbored fire. He turned his hand and grabbed the Cheng Luan sword behind his back, poised for a fight. Opposite him, Huan Hua Palace’s disciples each drew their swords and leveled them in front, glares meeting. Yue Qingyuan said, “Junior apprentice brother Liu, stand down.” Though Liu Qingge was not pleased or willing, if he had to listen to one person, he could only accept Yue Qingyuan’s words and so reluctantly let go of the sword handle. Seeing him withdraw, Yue Qingyue nodded. “This sort of accusation cannot be supported by mere words.” The long sword at his waist, its hilt as black as ink, suddenly sprung from the scabbard to reveal an inch of blinding white blade. In an instant, it was as if a giant formless net was cast above the entire grounds. Within the net, spiritual energy undulated like the tide, rolling and rushing without pause. The cry of the sword seemed to drone in the ear without respite. Quite a few relatively younger disciples inadvertently covered their ears, their hearts wildly pounding nonstop. Xuan Su sword!The people of various sects on the grounds were bowled over because of this. Yue Qingyuan told Liu Qingge to stand down because he was going to enter the conflict himself? Has the world turned upside down? It was said that since Yue Qingyuan took up the position of Cang Qiong Mountain’s highest peak lord, he had only drawn his sword twice. One time was the ceremony of receiving his office, the other time was in the battle with the descendant of the Heavenly Demon’s lineage (Luo Binghe’s father). Though Xuan Su sword only emerged an inch from the scabbard, everyone suddenly understood. To be able to sit on Qiong Ding hall’s highest place definitely needed more than just a mild and unflustered temperament! The Old Palace Master said, “Lay formations!” Was this the rhythm of war? The demonic clan hadn’t even fought their way here yet when humans began fighting first. Shen Qingqiu saw this situation was wrong. He hurried to grab his sword and threw it out in front. Xiu Ya sword flew straight and stuck into the ground in front of Huan Hua Palace’s Palace Master. To throw away a sword was the same as surrender, indicating he’d comply with his sentence. The Old Palace Master immediately retrieved the sword. He waved his hands to make his sect’s people return to their places. Yue Qingyuan said quietly, “Shidi!” Shen Qingqiu said, “Shixiong, you don’t need to say more, the truth will speak for itself. Qingqiu is willing to be restrained.” This Old Palace Master was like an old and confused personbiting fast and not letting go. Combining forces with the additional sower and Qiu Haitang, being imprisoned was an inevitability (final nail to the coffin). In any case, the original work also had this happen. He thought he had managed to avoid it, but didn’t anticipate he would still wind up traveling the fixed route of the original plot. There was no need to harm Cang Qiong Mountain and Huan Hua Palace to make two sects fall out (ripping their faces). Shen Qingqiu insisted, “Discussing any more is pointless. I offer myself up freely.” After saying this, he didn’t look to see Yue Qingyuan’s expression but instead swept Luo Binghe a quick glance. Neither happiness nor anger could be seen on his face. He stood steadily in his original place, a clear-cut contrast to the surrounding cultivators who had their ears covered while their heads spun.After a long pause, Yue Qingyuan finally sheathed his sword. It was as if an invisible net was removed from the air. Shen Qingqiu turned towards Yue Qingyuan and gave a deep bow. With all said and done, he had given this Shixiong a lot of trouble; it really was embarrassing. Qiu Haitang was still sobbing. When Qin Wangyue walked past her, she consoled her: “Young lady Qiu, whatever the situation turns out to be, the three sects will give you proper retribution.” She said three sects, pointedly leaving out Cang Qiong Mountain to make her position clear. Qiu Haitang’s expression was moved, eyes brimming with tears, and raised her head to thank her. Upon catching sight of Luo Binghe standing to one side, both of her cheeks couldn’t help but flush. Shen Qingqiu internally rolled his eyes. On that topic, he’d just been NTR’d right in front of his face, so why is it he didn’t feel unhappy at all! Gongyi Xiao led some Huan Hua Palace disciples to walk up, and the thing he held in his hands was very familiar. Hello Immortal-Binding Cable; goodbye Immortal-Binding Cable wave bye-bye. Gongyi Xiao’s tone was apologetic. “Elder Shen, please excuse me. This junior should treat you with respect. Before the truth comes to light, I will definitely not let Elder suffer the smallest slight.” Shen Qingqiu nodded, said four words: “Thanks for your trouble.” What good is it if only you treat me with respect? Looking at the expressions of all the Huan Hua Palace disciples present, he could tell that each one of them wanted to eat him raw. After all, back then during the Immortal Alliance Conference, the worst casualties were suffered by Huan Hua Palace; they had endured a great offense. Once the Immortal-Binding Cable was looped around him and securely tied, Shen Qingqiu felt his body sink. Before, whenever the Without a Cure poison flared up intermittently, he would only feel a blockage of spiritual energy, like a remote control with a bad connection that barely worked when hitting it. As soon as the Immortal-Binding Cable was on his body, it thoroughly cut off his spiritual energy, directly reducing him to an ordinary, physical body. The Old Palace Master said, “What does everyone think about setting the date of the public trial to one month hence?” Liu Qingge said, “Five days.” The longer one was imprisoned in the water prison, the more one wouldsuffer. Liu Qingge saying “five days” was to compress the course of the public trial preparation to the shortest time. Of course, the old palace master wouldn’t agree. “With this speed, I’m afraid much will be overlooked.” Mediation was Zhao Hua Temple’s specialty. An abbot suggested, “Why not make it ten days?” Yue Qingyuan said, “Seven days. No further delay is possible.” The haggling of a crowd of sect leaders could be mistaken as a vegetable market. Shen Qingqiu had his own considerations and hurriedly said, “No need to say more. Listen to the palace master’s arrangements. One month.” Any further delay would actually be favorable to the growth of the Dew Grass. Out of the corner of his eye, he looked at Shang Qinghua and wriggled his eyebrows. Shang Qinghua understood tacitly, two hands hanging in front of his body, secretly giving a “no worries, let me handle it” gesture. The only problem was… could he even survive in the Huan Hua Palace that was completely controlled by Luo Binghe?"
"“ 请前辈戴上这个。 ” 沈清秋一低头 , 一抹黑带横过 , 遮住了他的眼睛。 其实这纯粹是多此一举 , 以幻花宫迷阵之百变玄机 , 就算让沈清秋全程举着摄像机走一遍拍 一遍 , 他也未必能记住怎么进来怎么出去。 水牢空气潮湿，地面略滑，蒙住双眼 , 只能被身旁押送的弟子们带着行走。 沈清秋道： “ 公仪萧。 ” 公仪萧一直紧随在后 , 忙应道： “ 前辈？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 等待四派连审期间 , 我能不能与外界的人接触？ ” 公仪萧道： “ 持有幻花宫通行腰牌 , 才能在水牢中通行无阻。 ” 那如果要尚清华进来探监、商议露芝采用之事，倒是有点麻烦。沈清秋想了想，问道： “ 那些撒种人怎么处置了？ ” “ 焚烧过后，由昭华寺各位大师带回去超度了。 ” 一旁有个声音不满道： “ 师兄你和他说这么多干什么？进了这水牢，难不成还想出去？ ” 靠，这么耳熟，又是那个像跟他有仇的小麻子脸！ 公仪萧斥责道： “ 不得无礼！ ” 沈清秋笑道： “ 也不必责怪他。 ” 正说着，暂时收押他的地方就到了。解下眼上黑布，视线幽幽亮起，只见他们站在一个巨 大的钟乳洞之前。 溶洞底部是黝黑的湖面，四壁不规则分布着暗黄的火把，火光倒映在水面上，随波纹乱 舞。湖中央凸起一片人工修造的白色石台。颜色晶莹，几近玉色，必然是特殊材质。 公仪萧取出一串钥匙，摸到一处岩石，一番操作，湖底传来轧轧齿轮运转之声，升起一条 石道，直通向湖心那座石台。 公仪萧道： “ 前辈，请。 ” 那小麻脸弟子捡起一块普通石头，道： “ 看着！ ” 他把那石子投入湖水中，石子居然漂浮水面而不下沉，片刻之后，传来兹兹之声，仿佛变 成了一块铁板上的煎肉，表面爬满气泡，迅速被腐蚀消解得无影无踪。 小麻子得意道： “ 谁要是想从这里逃跑，或者从这里面劫人出来，那是痴心妄想！ ” 沈清秋被这凶残的液体震惊了。 这间水牢看起来和日月露华芝生长之地有点儿像，可要是在这湖里面打个滚，估计连骨都 渣都不剩。 而且这种液体起码比露水湖大上足足五倍！ 幻花宫不是名门正派吗，上哪儿搞这么多凶残液体的！！！ 沈清秋顺着石道走过去时，一路格外小心，万一脚底一滑那可不是好玩儿的。走上湖心石 台后，公仪萧再一转钥匙，这条通往湖心的小道就又沉入湖底去了。 沈清秋在石台上摆了个打坐的姿势，观望四下，心想，万一有人能御剑闯入，这些湖水也 没什么意义。 他刚这么想，就见公仪萧扳动了一个钥匙孔旁的机关。 忽然，头顶传来水流哗哗之声，沈清秋一抬头，刚好看到从上空四面八方降下道道颜色深 浊的水流，形成了密不透风的水帘，把他包围在六丈见方的石台之中。 …… 我错了！这别说是人了，就算苍蝇都飞不出去好么！ 幻花宫水牢果然名不虚传！怪不得是众派一致推举的公立监狱！ 沈清秋知道，一定会有人来找麻烦的，可没料到这么快。 沈清秋是被一盆冷水泼醒的。 他冻得一个激灵，先开始还以为是腐蚀性液体，甩甩脑袋，努力眨眼，冰水糊进眼睛的感 觉极不舒服，才确定这只是普通的水。身上缠了百十八道的捆仙索极细，却牢牢锁住了他 的灵脉，甚至连血脉都被捆得流不通，御寒能力大降，不由哆嗦了一下。 四面的水帘断流了，连接石台和外界的升降道也升了起来。 视线逐渐明晰。往上移，先看到一双玲珑娇小的绣花鞋，再往上看，则是粉色裙摆。只见 一个满身珠光宝气，柳眉倒竖杏眼圆睁的小姑娘，正扛着一条鞭子瞪着他。 沈清秋心底翻个白眼。 洛冰河固然够折腾人了，他这些老婆也真是让人受够了！ 走马观花一样一个接一个出现。不要再出现了他又不是原装货根本没有猥亵美女的兴趣好 吗！？ 小姑娘鞭子直指他： “ 醒了就别装死，本宫主有话问你！ ” 以她的辈分，就算沈清秋现在实为阶下囚，也轮不到她来审问。 沈清秋道： “ 这似乎不是小宫主该做的事。 ” 幻花宫老宫主的掌上明珠、洛冰河后宫刁蛮之首，道： “ 既然你知道我是谁，那也该知道 我来的目的了？ ” 她眼眶一红，咬牙切齿道： “ 你这个勾结魔界、出卖同门的卑鄙小人！既然落到了本宫主 手里，我要你好看！ ” 沈清秋： “…… 我好像还没承认勾结魔界之事。 ” 小宫主跺脚道： “ 你对洛哥哥那么狠心、那么歹毒，勾结魔族的事，自然也做得出来。 ” 遗传的力量果然强大，这逻辑绝对是老宫主亲生的！ 沈清秋无语片刻，道： “ 他有说过我对他狠心歹毒？ ” 小宫主声情并茂： “ 洛哥哥那么好的人，当然不会这么说。他受过的伤，都藏在心里，谁 也不让碰，谁也不让看 …… 可你以为他不说，我就看不出来？！ ” …… 这真情实感的 …… 沈清秋整个人都不好了！ 这他妈是诗朗诵大赛现场吗？！ 他简直不知道该捶地狂笑还是默默无言，对不起！我知道对着款款吐露深情的妹子大笑是 很没礼貌的事！但这真的是太羞耻了！简直羞耻 play ！ 洛冰河的后宫虽然庞大，但还真是乌烟瘴气，什么类型都有。这就是贪多嚼不烂，要量不 要质的后果。也是向天打飞机作为一个女人小手都没摸过几次的死宅男非要写种马文的后 果，活该哈哈哈哈！ 小宫主忽然狐疑道： “ 你那是什么表情？ ” 沈清秋连忙收敛了一下，检查脸刚才绷住了没。得罪这丫头可没有好果子吃。 果然，小宫主勃然大怒： “ 你刚才那是在嘲笑我吗？！ ” 小宫主原本倾心于青梅竹马的公仪萧，而洛冰河出现后，一腔热爱都朝男主汹涌而去。没 办法，天降战竹马，天降自古以来都赢得毫不费力。这种移情别恋的设定种马文里其实很 常见，因为世界上总会有很多 ntr 爱好者，无论是 ntr 别人还是被人 ntr ，他们都能从这种情 节里获得异样快感。移情别恋者固然自觉无措，但总归是心虚，见别人神情不对，就觉得 是在嘲笑自己。小宫主恼羞成怒，一挥手臂，长鞭甩出！ 那鞭子来势汹汹，破空声尖锐至极，沈清秋被捆仙索缚住了灵力运转，身手却还没退化， 就地一滚，鞭身刚好砸在他脚边不到三尺。 石台被砸得石屑并碎尘飞溅，沈清秋单膝跪地，定住身形。 我靠一个小姑娘为什么要用这种带倒刺的铁鞭！！！画风不对！！！ 更不对的是原著里面小宫主的精铁鞭不是专打情敌吗！！！抢男人撕【哔  】用的装备 啊！从来只打被洛冰河多看两眼的漂亮女人，为什么现在要它来打男人！！！它在哭泣你 听到了吗？！ 真是够了能不能别再把这种剧本拿给我啊！！！ 小宫主一击不中，怒火更盛，娇叱一声，回鞭起势。石台就那么大块地方，沈清秋又被缚 住，反应再快，也难免被鞭风擦到，衣料嗤啦碎了几处，还没伤到皮肉。可连连躲闪，很 快就退到石台边缘，眼看退无可退，只能硬生生受上一鞭，沈清秋咬牙立定，闭目等待剧 痛来袭！ 可等了半晌，半天也没感觉皮肉受痛。他猛地睁开双眼，一看身前，心瞬间沉了下来。 洛冰河赤手握住了鞭梢，眼中仿佛有两团漆黑的鬼火在燃烧，又冷又骇人。 他一字一句，声音冻到人心底： “ 你在干什么？ ” 小宫主不知他什么时候出现的，吓了一跳，但更害怕的，是他脸上那种从未见过的冷厉表 情，情不自禁打了个寒噤。 打自相识，洛冰河从来都是款款温柔，很会哄人开心，哪里用这样要杀人的目光看过她。 她不由倒退几步，嗫嚅道： “ 我 …… 我 …… 我找爹爹要了腰牌，来审问一下他 ……” 洛冰河冷冷地道： “ 四派联审在一个月之后。 ” 小宫主忽然觉得委屈。她大声喊道： “ 他害了我那么多师兄师姐，那么多！而且他对你不 好！我来教训一下他怎么了？！ ” 洛冰河把她的鞭子彻底夺过去，视上面的锐利倒刺犹如无物。手中不见如何用力，再松开 五指时，那鞭子节节精铁，居然变成了一堆碎铁。 洛冰河漠然道： “ 回去。 ” 小宫主眼睁睁看着心爱之物就这么变成了一堆渣渣， “ 啊 ” 的一声，不可置信。 她带着哭腔一指沈清秋： “ 你、你居然为你师父这么对我 ……” 洛冰河头也不回，把手中铁鞭残料扔进湖中，嗤嗤兹兹的腐蚀之声不绝于耳。 小宫主看得嘴唇发抖。 刹那间，她忽然觉得，洛冰河想一寸一寸捏碎然后扔进腐蚀湖里的，是她。一点儿也不是 开玩笑。 小宫主大吼道： “ 明明我是为你好！ ” 吼完之后，转身边泪奔边飞奔而去。 沈清秋心中咆哮： “ 剧本不对啊卧槽  这他妈有哪里不对啊 ” 还没咆哮完，洛冰河的视线就挪到了他身上。 沈清秋一阵牙疼胃疼蛋疼。 这种时候，他宁可小宫主抽他个百八十鞭子，顶多是皮肉疼，总好过跟洛冰河独处一个密 闭空间里哪儿都疼谢谢！ 两人相对沉默半晌，洛冰河靠近了一步。 沈清秋立刻矜持地保持了距离。 洛冰河伸出去的手在半空中僵了一会儿，撤了回去。 他哼道： “ 师尊何必如此警惕，我若是想对你做什么，根本用不着触碰。 ” 沈清秋明白，他指的是自己已经饮下了天魔之血。 即便是一滴入腹，都像是埋下一颗定时炸弹在体内，有无限的可能性。只要洛冰河想，只 消勾勾手指，就能让他肠穿肚烂，痛不欲生。 如此说来，洛冰河刚才那一句倒是实话。 沈清秋坐回打坐的姿势，抬眼与洛冰河对视。 一个月。 说什么也要撑过一个月。 撑过之后，海阔天高任鸟飞，妈蛋的这些破事破人老子都不管了！！！ 两人沉默一阵，沈清秋忽然道： “ 你要是想对我做什么，也不急于一时。待到四派联审结 束之后，我身败名裂，一切再无转圜余地，那时候你再清算总账，岂不痛快？ ” 他这一席话，完全是按照自己所知的原著洛冰河式思维说出来的。照理来说，应该非常合 洛冰河的口味才对。 意料之外的是，洛冰河眼神暗了暗。 他缓缓道： “ 师尊为什么这么确定，联审会被判有罪？ ” 沈清秋： “…… 这得问你不是吗？ ” 洛冰河重复道： “ 问我？ ” 他冷笑一声： “ 又是我。 ” 不是你还能有谁。沈清秋无语。","CHAPTER 37: LABYRINTH WATER PRISON PART 1 “Elder Shen, please wear this.” When Shen Qingqiu bowed his head, a strip of black cloth covered his eyes. Actually, this was purely superfluous. Given the myriad mysterious patterns in Huan Hua Palace’s labyrinth formation, even if Shen Qingqiu recorded the entire journey with a video camera, he would still have trouble remembering how to enter and exit. The water prison was humid, the ground somewhat slippery. With both eyes blindfolded, he could only rely on the escorting disciples to lead the way. Shen Qingqiu said: “Gongyi Xiao.” Gongyi Xiao had been continuously following behind him, and hastened to answer: “Elder Shen?” Shen Qingqiu said: “While waiting for the trial held by the four factions, can I contact people from the outside world?” Gongyi Xiao said: “Only those who hold the Huan Hua Palace passage waist card can enter the water prison unobstructed.” In this case, it would be a bit of a hassle for Shang Qinghua to visit him in prison to discuss the use of the Dew Seed. Shen Qingqiu thought for a bit and asked: “How were those sowers dealt with?” Gongyi Xiao answered all his questions: “After they were incinerated, the great masters of Zhaohua Temple took the remains back to perform ceremonies for their souls 129 .” From the side came a dissatisfied voice: “Senior brother, why are you talking to him so much? After entering the water prison, does he actually want to try to leave?” This familiar voice, it was yet again that pocked-face disciple with a grudge against him! Gongyi Xiao scolded: “Don’t be rude!” Shen Qingqiu smiled and said: “At this moment, I am indeed a prisoner. There is no need to reproach him. You may all do as you please.” Just as he said this, they arrived at the location where he was to be temporarily held in custody. The black cloth strip was removed from his eyes and his line of sight faintly lit up, only to see they were standing in front of ahuge stone cave. Below was the surface of a dark lake. Dim yellow torches were placed at irregular intervals on the four walls. The firelight was reflected on the water’s surface, dancing wildly in the rippling waves. A man-made white stone platform rose from the center of the lake, glittering and translucent in its jade-like color 130 it was definitely made from a special material. Gongyi Xiao took out a string of keys and touched an area of the stone. After performing some operation, the mechanical sound of rolling gears came from the bottom of the lake. A stone path rose up that led to the stone platform in the lake’s center. Gongyi Xiao said: “Elder Shen, please.” The pocked-face disciple picked up an ordinary stone and said: “Watch!” He threw the pebble into the lake water, which actually floated on the water’s surface instead of sinking. After a moment, numerous bubbles rose to the water’s surface, sizzling like a piece of fried meat on a hot iron grill. The pebble was swiftly corroded and dissolved without a trace. The pocked-face disciple proudly said: “This water prison doesn’t get to be used often. Whoever wants to escape or abduct someone kept inside is deluding themselves with wishful thinking!” Shen Qingqiu was shocked by the destructiveness of this liquid. If someone rolled into this lake, even their bones probably wouldn’t leave a trace. Isn’t the Huan Hua Palace a famous righteous sect? Where did they get so much of this obviously illegal destructive liquid? Shen Qingqiu followed the stone path, walking extraordinarily carefully. If he slipped on the stone, what happened next would not be fun. When he reached the stone platform in the center of the lake, Gongyi Xiao turned the key once again, and the small path sank back into the lakebed. Shen Qingqiu sat on the ground of the stone platform. He took in his surroundings, secretly debating with himself if he would be able to fly over the water with his sword, which would make the corrosive water pointless. He was just thinking this over when he saw Gongyi Xiao turn a mechanism next to the keyhole. After that, the sound of flowing water came from overhead. Shen Qingqiu looked up and saw dark and cloudy water descending from the sky in all directions, forming an air-tight curtain of water that encircled him on the 20 meter 131 square stone platform.I was wrong! Don’t mention humans, even a fly wouldn’t be able to escape! The Huan Hua Palace Water Prison really does deserve its reputation. No wonder all the sects unanimously elected it as the public jail! Shen Qingqiu knew there would definitely be people coming to trouble him, but he did not expect it to happen so fast. He was awakened from being splashed by a basin of cold water. The freezing cold made Shen Qingqiu shiver, and at first, he thought that he had somehow dozed off and fallen into the lake. He shook his head and labored to blink against the extremely uncomfortable sensation of ice-cold water in his eyes. Only then did he confirm it was only normal water. The 108 Immortal-Binding Cables wrapped around his body were extremely thin, but still firmly locked down his spiritual veins and even restricted his blood flow. With his ability to resist cold greatly reduced, he could not help but shiver. The water curtain on all sides was cut off, and the path connecting the stone platform to the outside world also rose. His line of sight gradually became clear. Looking up, he first saw a pair of exquisitely embroidered shoes. Looking up even further, he saw a pink skirt. Standing there was a young girl dressed entirely in pink, richly bejeweled. She arched her willowy eyebrows and glared at him with almond-shaped eyes, as she held a metal whip. Shen Qingqiu secretly rolled his eyes. Luo Binghe was of course far too good at tormenting people, and these wives of his were truly enough to test anyone’s limits. They kept rapidly appearing one after another, like glancing at flowers while on horseback, and one after another they all gave him trouble. Don’t show up anymorethis Shen Qingqiu is not the original goods and simply has no interest in lewd beautiful women, okay? The little girl’s whip pointed directly at him: “If you’re awake, stop pretending to be dead. This palace master has something to ask you!” Given her (lack of) generation and strength, no matter how discomposed Shen Qingqiu was right now, it still wasn’t her place to come interrogate him. Shen Qingqiu said: “This does not seem to be the kind of matter the little palace mistress should be handling.” This apple of the old palace master’s eye 132 , this belligerent head of Luo Binghe’s harem, said without a trace of politeness: “Cease your chatter! Sinceyou know who I am, then you should know the purpose of my visit!” Her eyes reddened and she gnashed her teeth: “You are such a despicable villain, colluding with the Demon world and betraying your fellows! You will get your comeuppance! Today you have fallen into this palace master’s hands I’m going to teach you a lesson!” Shen Qingqiu: “I don’t seem to remember admitting to colluding with the Demon world.” The little palace mistress stomped her feet: “You think just because you won’t admit it, I can’t punish you? You’re so unjust, you’ve long been a famous senior but you treated Big Brother Luo with such heartlessness and viciousness naturally, you’d do things like colluding with the Demon race.” The power of heredity is indeed really strong, this logic is absolutely true- born from the old palace master! Shen Qingqiu was speechless for a moment before he said: “He truly said that I treated him heartlessly and viciously?” The little palace mistress spoke with a beautiful song and deep feeling: “Big Brother Luo is such a good person, of course, he would not say so. The injuries he suffered are all hidden deep within his heart. He will not let anyone touch them, he will not let anyone see… But did you think that just because he did not say anything out loud, I cannot see the wounds on his soul? Are you saying I have no eyes and no heart?” These true feelings and honest emotions… Shen Qingqiu’s entire person didn’t feel good! Is this a fucking poetry recitation contest? He really didn’t know whether to thump the ground and laugh hysterically or to let his eyes brim over with warm tears. I’m sorry! I know that it’s really rude to laugh at a sister who is sincerely revealing her deep love! But this is truly too humiliating! Simply erotically humiliating! Although Luo Binghe’s harem was immense, it really was a tremendous mess, with all possible types. This was the result of him biting off more than he could chew, going for quantity over quality. It was also the result of Airplane Towards the Sky insisting on writing a stallion novel despite being an eternal virgin who had barely touched a woman’s hand a few timesserves you right hahaha! The little palace mistress was suddenly suspicious: “What’s that expression on your face?” Shen Qingqiu at once curbed his mirth, checking whether his face had justbeen stretched. Offending this girl would not lead to a happy ending. Sure enough, the little palace mistress flew into an agitated rage: “Were you laughing at me just now?” The little palace mistress was originally enamored with her childhood friend Gongyi Xiao. After Luo Binghe’s appearance, all her ardent love surged towards the male protagonist. There was nothing that could be done. From ancient times to the present, whenever the childhood friend battles the newly appeared fated love rival 133 , the fated rival always wins without a doubt. This kind of “shifting one’s affections to fall in love with someone else” set-up is actually very common in stallion novels, because there are always many NTR 134 enthusiasts in the world. Whether NTRing someone else or being NTRed, they can all obtain peculiar pleasure from this kind of story. The one who shifts their affections, of course, thinks they are pursuing their true love and haven’t done anything wrong, but in the end, they possess a guilty conscience. If they see another person looking at them with a strange expression, they will feel that the other person is laughing at themselves. The little palace mistress thus became furious from embarrassment, and with a wave of her arm, the long whip came cracking over! The whip surged over menacingly, piercing the air with an extremely shrill sound. The Immortal-Binding Cables restricted Shen Qingqiu’s circulation of spiritual power, but his physical skill had not degraded. He rolled to the side just as the whip smashed down not a meter 135 from his feet. When the stone platform was smashed, stone chips and shattered dust flew everywhere. Shen Qingqiu knelt on one knee and steadied his body. What the fuck, why is a young girl using this kind of barbed iron whip! This style is just wrong! What’s even more wrong is that in the original book, the little palace mistress’s fine iron whip was especially used to hit love rivals! An equipment used for tearing clothes while fighting over a man! It’s only ever hit beautiful women who Luo Binghe stared at for a little too long, so why is it now being used to hit a man? It’s weeping, can’t you hear? I’ve really had enough, can you stop shoving this kind of script onto me? After the little palace mistress missed this blow, her rage grew stronger. With a whip crack sound, the whip returned with more force. No matter the size of the stone platform or the speed of Shen Qingqiu’s reaction time, he had still been tied up, so he was inevitably scraped by the whip wind. His clothes ripped in a few places, though his flesh was still unharmed.But as he continued to dodge and evade, he soon retreated to the edge of the stone platform. Seeing he could not retreat any further, he could only harshly receive the next lash. Shen Qingqiu resolved to grit his teeth and close his eyes, awaiting the painful strike! But despite waiting for a long while, he still didn’t feel any pain stinging his flesh. He abruptly opened his eyes, and his heart immediately sank. Luo Binghe grasped the whiplash with his bare hands. There seemed to be two pitch-black ghost fires burning in his eyes, cold and terrifying. He spoke one word at a time, his voice cold enough to freeze one’s heart: “What are you doing?” The little palace mistress did not know when he had arrived and was frightened by his sudden appearance. But what truly frightened her was the frigid expression on his face that she had never seen before. She couldn’t help but shiver. Ever since they became acquainted, Luo Binghe had always been sincerely gentle and soft, very good at cheering others up. When had he ever looked at her with this violent and murderous gaze? The little palace mistress could not help but take several steps back, and hesitantly said: “I… I… I asked Dad for a waist card to come and interrogate him…” Luo Binghe said coldly: “The joint trial of the four sects is after one month.” The little palace mistress suddenly felt wronged. She shouted: “He has hurt so many of my disciple-brothers and sisters, so many! And he treated you badly! What’s wrong with me teaching him a lesson?” Luo Binghe snatched the entirety of her whip, disregarding the sharp barbs like they did not exist. His hand did not appear to use any force, but when his five fingers loosened, the segmented fine iron whip had actually turned into a pile of broken and crushed iron. Luo Binghe indifferently said: “Go back.” The little palace mistress watched with wide eyes as her beloved weapon turned into a pile of slag just like that. She let out an “Ah” in sheer disbelief. She tearfully pointed at Shen Qingqiu, then pointed at Luo Binghe: “You, you are treating me like this? I am venting your anger for you, but you are not letting me touch him?” Luo Binghe did not say anything, only threw the iron whip debris in his hand into the lake. The sizzling and hissing sound of corrosion lingered in theirears. Watching this, the little palace mistress’s lips trembled. In that instant, she suddenly felt that what Luo Binghe wanted to crush inch by inch and then throw into the corrosive lake… was her. That wasn’t a joke at all. Full of grief and indignation, the little palace mistress yelled: “I am obviously doing this for your own good!” After yelling this, she turned around, crying as she darted away. Shen Qingqiu roared in his heart: “This script is not right, fuckwhere did it go wrong” He hadn’t finished roaring when Luo Binghe’s gaze shifted to him. Shen Qingqiu’s entire body began to ache. At this time, he would rather the little palace mistress whipped him with one hundred and eighty lashes. At most that would be just pain in the flesh, far better than having pain all over his body from being alone with Luo Binghe in a confined space! The two of them faced each other in silence for a long time. Luo Binghe took one step closer. Shen Qingqiu subconsciously preserved the distance between them. Luo Binghe’s extended hand froze in the air for a while and withdrew back. He humphed: “Why does Shizun need to be this vigilant? If I wanted to do anything to you, I wouldn’t need to touch you at all.” That was a great truth. Even one drop of Heavenly Demon blood entering the abdomen was akin to burying a ticking time bomb in the body, with infinite possibilities for suffering. All Luo Binghe had to do was think, and a hook of his finger could make Shen Qingqiu’s intestines rearrange and his stomach rot, so excruciating as to make him beg for death. Shen Qingqiu sat back into the posture of meditation, raising his eyes to meet Luo Binghe’s gaze. One month. No matter what, he had to hold on for one month. After holding on, he would be as free as a fish in the ocean, as liberated as a bird in the sky 136 . I 137 won’t have to care about all these stupid things! The two of them were silent for a while. Shen Qingqiu considered for a moment and said: “If you wish to do anything to me, there is no need to rush. After the end of the four sects’ joint trial, I will be completely disgraced and my reputation ruined, with utterly no hope of salvation. Wouldn’t settling the ledgerat that time give you just cause to be even more overjoyed?” These words of his were entirely based on the original Luo Binghe’s type of mindset. Reasonably speaking, they should fit Luo Binghe’s taste exceedingly well. What was unexpected was that Luo Binghe’s expression did not clear up, but instead became even more chilly and ice-cold. He narrowed his eyes: “Why is Shizun so certain that the joint trial will find you guilty?” Shen Qingqiu: “I should be asking you this, shouldn’t I?” Luo Binghe repeated back: “Asking me?” He sneered: “Me again.” Shen Qingqiu was speechless."
"洛冰河面色阴郁 , 负手在他面前来回踱了几圈。 沈清秋正想着 , 他该是在琢磨着怎么炮制自己呢 , 就见洛冰河猛地回头。 他厉声道： “ 敢问师尊 , 是不是天底下所有魔族杀了人、屠了城，这些罪孽 , 都要算在我头 上？ ” 沈清秋挑了挑眉。 见他不答 , 洛冰河慢慢攥紧拳头，又道： “ 从前分明那般信任于我 , 如今却又处处怀疑我居心 叵测。界族之别 , 当真这么重要 , 能让师尊对一个人的态度彻头彻尾转变？ ” 不, 你没 get 到重点。关键不在于界族之别 , 而在于男主与渣反之别！ 原主洛冰河从来没有在死期将近的渣反面前掩饰真实面目的爱好。看这情形，不像要立刻 搞死他的节奏。 沈清秋心里有了底，再开口胆子又肥了。 沈清秋道： “ 既然如此，我也有话要问你。 ” 洛冰河侧首道： “ 弟子恭听。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 你潜入幻花宫内部，若不是叵测，那么究竟居心何在？ ” 这真是他心中特别想问的一个问题。 究竟是为什么？！男主居然会自己不按着原有思维和剧情走？ 听到这句，洛冰河似乎怔住了，动了动嘴唇，却没说出话来。 说不出来，就不要怪人怀疑你居心叵测了 …… 但是男主你这不对劲啊！ 原作里嘴炮都能单扛一个苍穹山的舌灿莲花呢？！ 沈清秋道： “ 答不出来？ ” 早告诉你了，这就是无间副本打太快不好好修炼刷分的代价。你看，技能没练够点吧！？ 洛冰河低下头。昏暗的地牢中，水色共火光颤动，看不清脸上表情如何。 默然半晌，洛冰河忽然道： “ 我希望师尊真心实意回答我一句话。 ” 抿了抿嘴，他生硬地补充道： “ 只一句。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 讲。 ” 洛冰河顿了顿，轻吸一口气。 他低声道： “ 可有后悔？ ” 沈清秋以为自己听错了。 他闭口不言，眼珠转动，把洛冰河从头到脚打量一番。 这个 “ 可有后悔 ” ，当然问的只有一件事。全文不缩写就是问他把洛冰河踹下无间深渊去可 有后悔。 洛冰河为什么问他这种问题？ 废话。他当然后悔了肠子都悔青了。但是问这种问题有意义吗？！ 沈清秋正太阳穴一抽一抽的，忽然眼前跳出一个巨大的弹窗。 系统：【请看选择题： 选项 a ：悔。为师早就悔了，这几年无时不刻都在追悔莫及。 选项 b ：（冷笑）看到你如今这幅模样，就知道无需后悔！ 选项 c ：保持沉默。】 …… 能死开么  你特么升级更新了的原来就是这种东西吗  那个括弧里面的是什么鬼？！连语气和表情都给我设置好了，你以为是玩 galgame 吗  还不如原来那个低级版呢谁快来给我一个系统 1.0 的安装包  我谢谢他全家！ 沈清秋满脸黑线： “a 也太假了！我是洛冰河我都不信，而且还会恶心好么！ b 算怎么回 事？！你是嫌弃他上次没把我掐死？傻逼才这么说！ ” 系统：【请选择。】 沈清秋： “ccc ！ ” 系统：【形象哲学深度 +10. 】 沈清秋： “ 谁能告诉我，这个 ‘ 形象哲学深度 ’ ，究竟是怎么算的？ ” 他就这么目不斜视，保持沉默。 洛冰河等不到回答，紧握的拳头慢慢松开，自嘲道： “ 明知答案，还问师尊这个问题，我 也是够蠢。 ” 沈清秋打定主意，从现在开始，一句也不和他对答。 这太不对劲儿了。 要不是知道洛冰河乃本世界所有系统的总能源，沈清秋绝对会怀疑他被穿了。 要不是上帝视角洞悉剧情，沈清秋也绝对会怀疑 …… 洛冰河大概真的有那么一点点难过。 沉默是金，多说多错。沈清秋闭上眼睛，盘足静坐。 对面一阵沉寂，洛冰河又凉又轻的声音传来。 “ 师尊你总是少言寡语，以前对着我还能多说几句，如今也不肯了。 ” 顿了顿，语气陡然一变，他狞笑道： “ 不过没关系，我有的是办法，让你开口。 ” 说话你不开心，不说话你也不开心，何苦！ 最后一句刚说完，沈清秋就蓦地睁开了眼睛。 从小腹深处传来一阵细微的刺痛。 片刻之后，刺痛消失，取而代之的是，是一种什么东西在血管里爬行的异样感觉。 天魔之血蛰伏多日，已经完全适应宿主体内的环境，这时受到原主感召，凝化成虫，开始 在这具身体内脏中四下试探。 洛冰河慢条斯理道： “ 脾脏，肾脏，心肝，肺腑。 ” 他每说一个地方，那个地方就传来诡异至极的痒痛。真的是又痒又痛，就像排排细碎的牙 齿在密密地啃噬，还伴着一股灼烧感。 虽然不至于痛彻心扉，但也够人受得了。 沈清秋坐不住了，不由自主弯下腰，有蜷成一团的冲动，冷汗顺着下巴上未干的水珠滴 落。 男主画风总算是对了，可是轮到他不好了。妈的肚子好痛，妹子来大姨妈是不是就这种感 觉？！ 洛冰河温声道： “ 师尊，你想让它在哪里下口？ ” 哪里都不想！！！不对原来它还没下口吗？！那它下口了该是什么感觉！！！ 沈清秋呼了系统一巴掌： “ 想点办法行吗？好歹我也算是你客户对吧？！ ” 系统：【是否启用关键道具：假玉观音？温馨提示：此道具使用权限仅一次。】 沈清秋： “ 现在洛冰河怒气值为多少？ ” 系统：【 30 点 . 】 沈清秋： “ 为什么这么低？你确定没空算错？！完全不科学！ ” 能消除 5000 点的神器对付 30 点，绝对不行！ 沈清秋： “ 还有没有别的选项？业内好评度排行第二的方案是什么？ ” 系统：【是否启用情景小推手？】 …… 这个名字听起来好像不太高级。但是既然是业内排行第二顺位方案，就它了！ 沈清秋果断戳下！ 洛冰河冷笑： “ 既不想看我，也不和我说话，是嫌污浊么？ ” 说着，倏地上前一步，哼道： “ 既然如此，偏不如你的意！ ” 伸手便去抓沈清秋肩部。 见他动作，沈清秋下意识错身一闪。洛冰河捉了个空，只捉到一片衣料。原本这件外袍就 被小宫主的鞭风刮得七零八落，这么一扯，嗤啦一声，直接大半都从肩膀上撕裂开来。 这种发展两人都始料不及，当场双双愣住，石化原地。 沈清秋刚被泼了一头一脸的冰水，到现在，衣衫和头发 * 的贴着白皙的皮肉，细如红线的 捆仙索在身上道道缠缚，即便脸上的表情尽是正直得不能再正直的错愕，可整个人看起来 ，仍然是极其的 …… 不端庄。 洛冰河眼睛一下子睁大了。 呆了一会儿，他才猛地反应过来，像是被烙铁烫了，立即甩手转身！ 他这一回避，原先在内脏中蠢蠢欲动的血蛊仿佛也受了惊吓，作鸟兽散，血管中刚才那种 明显的堵塞感顿时消散。 沈清秋喘了一口气，心中咆哮：大姨妈不痛啦！ 所以说这个情景小推手到底是怎么运作的？！还不如叫爆衣小能手，就是让他爆了一下衣 啊？！原理指什么？利用洛冰河看到男人半果体之后的生理厌恶吗？！ 洛冰河背对他僵硬地站了一会儿，像是四肢都不知道怎么摆。忽然飞快地脱下外袍，往后 一扔。 外衣兜头罩面糊了沈清秋一脸。 沈清秋： “……” 这算什么意思？ 这个场景 …… 为什么莫名熟悉，莫名让人浑身不自在？ 为什么会让人联想到 “ 饱受蹂【躏的少女获救后，男票为她披上了温暖的大衣 ” 这种经典恶 俗桥段？！ 沈清秋毛骨悚然，接受不能，胳膊一顶，让墨色外袍从他肩膀上滑下来。 质地柔软细腻的外袍坠地，银色光晕顺着极细的流线型暗纹流过。洛冰河听到悉索声响， 回头一看，外衣委地。沈清秋谨慎地把它还往这边推了两下，其实他还有考虑，要不要给 洛冰河叠一叠，谁知道只是考虑，还没动手，一抬头，洛冰河已经转过身来，眼中反射着 亮得刺眼的火光，似乎怒气大涨。手背青筋突显，指节屈伸几下，发泄一般猛地打出几记 暴击。 这几下其实是一发连击，根本就没瞄准，几发打在湖面，远远炸起巨大的水花；还有一发 打在溶洞壁上，直接爆了个大坑出来，石块滚滚坠下，火把受震，落入湖中，居然不熄， 反而漂在水面上继续熊熊燃烧，火光映得洛冰河脸色忽明忽暗，鬼气冲天。 他缓缓收手，道： “ 差点忘了，魔族沾手的东西，师尊定是不喜。 ” 堂堂男主，本作第一 **oss ，居然在这儿不顾形象乱发脾气。这跟个不如意的小孩子气得 乱踢玩具积木有什么区别。 掉价，太掉价了！ 你没事轰石头干什么，你有种朝头上砍！朝这儿砍  哦不对，忘了现在砍的是他自己。","CHAPTER 38: LABYRINTH WATER PRISON PART 2 This story arc in Jinlan City was a new addition. According to the timeline of the original book, Luo Binghe was still leveling up underground at this time and never appeared at all. Shen Qingqiu was not able to take advantage of his omniscient perspective. But Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky had signed off on one thing: After Luo Binghe finished leveling up and returned to the surface, all the slaughters and conspiracies that followed were inextricably tied to him. No matter how one looked at it, the biggest suspect was Luo Binghe. Luo Binghe’s face was gloomy. His hands behind his back, he paced back and forth a few times. Suddenly, he turned back and harshly said: “May I ask Shizun, are all the murders and crimes committed by demons in this world entirely my fault?” Shen Qingqiu’s brows tightened. Seeing that he did not answer, Luo Binghe slowly clenched his fists and said: “You once clearly trusted me to such an extent, but now at every turn you doubt my motives to be unfathomable. Are the differences between races really so significant as to completely change your attitude towards a person?” Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help himself any longer, and mustered up his courage: “In that case, I have something to ask you.” Luo Binghe inclined his head: “This disciple is listening respectfully.” Shen Qingqiu said: “You deny having any unfathomable motives for assimilating into Huan Hua Palace, but then what, exactly, are your true motives for doing so?” Why did the male protagonist himself actually not follow the original story? After suffering enough coercion from both the System and the plot, Shen Qingqiu had to ask the question on his mind. Upon hearing this, Luo Binghe was startled. His lips moved and he seemed to want to say something, but he ultimately hesitated and didn’t speak. Shen Qingqiu was actually a little surprised: “You can’t answer?” What happened to the original work’s persuasiveness that could single- handedly take on Cang Qiong Mountain with his sheer eloquence? Could this be the price he paid for going through the Infinite Abyss instance 138 too fast and neglecting to practice his cheats? Perhaps he didn’t raise his “Persuasion” skill enough…Luo Binghe said: “Shizun will not believe me anyhow. What difference does it make if I answer or not?” The glow of the water and the light of the torches quivered together in the dim dungeon. Shen Qingqiu’s heart seemed to tremble with them. Both of them remained silent for a long while. Luo Binghe suddenly said: “But I hope that Shizun can sincerely answer one question of mine.” He pursed his lips and stiffly added: “Just one question.” Shen Qingqiu said: “Speak.” Luo Binghe softly inhaled. He whispered: “Do you regret it?” Shen Qingqiu sealed his lips and did not speak. His eyes turned to evaluate Luo Binghe from head to toe. The full meaning of this “Do you regret it” was not spelled out, but it should be referring to whether he regrets kicking Luo Binghe into the Infinite Abyss. You don’t say. Of course, he regrets it, he regrets it to death 139 . But what is the meaning of Luo Binghe asking this question in the first place? Shen Qingqiu’s temples pulsed, when suddenly an enormous pop-up window jumped out in front of him. System: Please choose an answer from this multiple choice question: Option A: I regret it. This teacher has long since regretted it. The last few years, I have spent every moment uselessly repenting. Option B: (sneer) Seeing what you’ve become today, you know there’s no reason for me to regret it! Option C: Keep silent. … Fuck off What the hell, your upgrade was originally for this sort of thing? What’s this bullshit inside the bracket? Even the tone and expression are pre-set for me. Do you think this is a GALGAME 140 ? This isn’t even as good as the original low-level version. Someone hurry and give me an installation package for the System 1.0I’ll thank him and his whole family! Shen Qingqiu had a face full of black lines 141 : “A is way too fake! If I was Luo Binghe, I wouldn’t believe it, and would even find it disgusting. And what’s with B? Do you resent that he didn’t choke me to death last time?” System: Please make a selection. Shen Qingqiu: “CCC!” System: Literary and philosophical depth +10. Shen Qingqiu: “Can anyone tell me how exactly this ‘literary and philosophical depth’ is calculated?” Just like that, he looked steadily forward and kept his silence. Luo Binghe didn’t receive any answer, and his clenched fist slowly loosened. He self-deprecatingly said: “I already clearly knew the answer, yet I still asked Shizun this question. I really am stupid.” If he didn’t know Luo Binghe was the total power source of all this world’s Systems, Shen Qingqiu would have definitely suspected he had transmigrated too. If he didn’t have an omniscient perspective that gave him insight into the plot, Shen Qingqiu would have definitely suspected that… Luo Binghe probably truly was… a little sad. Silence is golden. The more you talk, the more mistakes you make. Shen Qingqiu closed his eyes and sat cross-legged in quiet meditation. All was still and silent for a while. Then Luo Binghe’s cold and soft voice came again. “Shizun, you have always been reticent and taciturn. Before, you would at least speak a few more sentences to meNow you are not willing to do even that.” After a pause, his tone unexpectedly changed. He grinned maliciously: “Well, it doesn’t matter. I have plenty of ways to make you speak.” After he finished the last sentence, Shen Qingqiu suddenly opened his eyes. A wave of slight stabbing pain came from deep in his lower abdomen. You’re not happy when I speak, you’re not happy when I don’t speak. Why are you bothering with this, what did I do wrong? After a moment, the stabbing pain disappeared. In its place came the uncanny sensation of something crawling in his blood vessels. After hibernating for many days, the Heavenly Demon blood had already fully adapted to the environment of the host body. At this time, called by its original master, it condensed into insect form and began to probe all over the internal organs of the body. Luo Binghe leisurely said: “Spleen, kidney, liver, lungs.” Every time he named an area, there came an extremely bizarre itchy pain in that area. It truly was both itchy and painful, like dense rows of tiny teethgnawing and biting, accompanied by a burning sensation. Although the pain could not be considered excruciating, it was hitting the limits of his tolerance. Shen Qingqiu could no longer sit still. He couldn’t help but bend over, resisting the urge to curl up into a ball. Following the not yet dried water droplets on his jaw, his cold sweat trickled and fell. Luo Binghe’s style was finally correct, but now it was his turn to suffer. Damn, my stomach really fucking hurts. Is this how girls feel when going through period pain? Luo Binghe warmly said: “Shizun, where do you want it to exit?” I don’t want it anywhere! Speaking of that, it hasn’t exited yet? Then what would the sensation of it exiting be like? Shen Qingqiu slapped the System box: “Think of a solution, will you? Don’t I still count as your client?” System: Do you wish to enable the key item: Fake Jade Guanyin? Friendly Tip: This item can only be used once. Shen Qingqiu: “What is Luo Binghe’s anger level right now?” System: 30 points. Shen Qingqiu: “Why so low? Are you sure you didn’t calculate wrong? This is completely unscientific!” Using a magic artifact that can eliminate 5000 points to deal with 30 points, he absolutely can’t! Shen Qingqiu: “Are there any other options? What is the second highest rated program in the industry?” System: Do you wish to use the “Small Scenario Pusher”? This name doesn’t sound too high-grade. But since it is the second highest rated program in the industry, might as well use it. Shen Qingqiu decisively pressed the button! Luo Binghe sneered: “Refusing to look at me or talk with me, do you think I’m filthy?” Saying so, he abruptly stepped forward and humphed: “In that case, I’ll do the opposite of your wish!” He stretched his hand out to grab Shen Qingqiu’s shoulder. Seeing his movement, Shen Qingqiu subconsciously dodged aside. Luo Binghe grasped empty air, only catching a piece of clothing. This robe had originally been shredded into a hideous mess by the little palace mistress’s whip wind. Now with this tear, most of his robe was directlyripped off his shoulder. This kind of development was beyond everyone’s expectations. Both of them stared blankly, petrified. Shen Qingqiu’s face and head had recently been splashed with ice water, and up till now, his dripping wet clothes and hair still stuck to his lily-white flesh. The Immortal-Binding Cables wrapped and bound his body, as thin as a red string. Even though the expression on his face could not be any more honestly dumbfounded, his entire person looked extremely… undignified. Luo Binghe’s eyes suddenly widened. After a while, he abruptly broke out of his daze. Reacting like he was just burned by a soldering iron, Luo Binghe immediately flung his hand off and turned around! With this evasive movement, the blood insects originally ready for action in Shen Qingqiu’s internal organs seemed to startle. They scattered like frightened beasts and fowl, and the sensation of blockage in his blood vessels immediately dissipated. Shen Qingqiu breathed a sigh of relief and shed tears of joy in his heart: finally fucking gone! So how does this “Small Scenario Pusher” operate after all? Is it just making his clothing burst apart? Might as well call it “Small Clothing Burster.” What principle is it based on? Using Luo Binghe’s physiological revulsion at seeing a half-naked man? For a while, Luo Binghe stood stiffly with his back to him, as if he didn’t know where to put his limbs. All of a sudden, he took off his robe at lightning speed and tossed it backward. The robe was plastered onto Shen Qingqiu’s face. Shen Qingqiu: “…” What’s this supposed to mean? This scene, this action… Why does it inexplicably make him uneasy? He couldn’t help but think of the classic vulgar scene: “After the devastated girl is rescued from her suffering, her boyfriend drapes his warm coat over her”… Shen Qingqiu’s blood ran cold and his hair stood on end at the thought. With a tip of his arm, he let the ink-colored robe slide off his shoulder. The soft-textured and exquisite robe fell to the ground, a silver halo following the thin streamlined dusky patterns. Luo Binghe heard the rustling sound and looked back to see the robe cast aside on the ground. Shen Qingqiu even cautiously pushed it back towards him twice.In actuality, Shen Qingqiu was just considering whether to fold it for Luo Binghe. He was in the midst of considering it and had yet to act, when he raised his head to see Luo Binghe had already turned back towards him. Harsh flames were reflected in Luo Binghe’s eyes, and it seemed like his fury had swelled. The blue veins on the back of his hand popped and he flexed his knuckles a few times. As if venting his rage, he ferociously let out a few violent strikes. These few strikes were actually a combination of attacks, not aimed accurately at all. A few of the blows hit the lake surface, bursting into huge splashes in the distance. Another one exploded against the wall of the cave, creating a large hole. Pieces of stone tumbled down. The torches shuddered and trembled, falling into the lake. They actually did not go out, but instead floated on the water’s surface, continuing to blaze and burn. The firelight made Luo Binghe’s face rapidly flicker light and dark, his ghastly aura filling the air. He slowly withdrew his hand and said: “I almost forgotShizun surely hates anything tainted by the touch of Demons.” A dignified and formidable male protagonist, actually throwing a messy and unreasonable tantrum with complete disregard for his image. What difference is there between this and a dissatisfied child angrily kicking his toy building blocks? This is cheapening out, truly cheapening out. A perfectly good cave had to be smashed full of holes and pits before Luo Binghe finally let out enough of his anger. When Luo Binghe turned around, Shen Qingqiu still had the casual attitude of an onlooker, as if nothing had just happened. Luo Binghe’s temple seemed to throb a few times. He grit his teeth: “I want to see with my own eyes how in one month, you will be completely disgraced and your reputation ruined!” Throwing down this last sentence, he stormed out. When he left the cave, he brutally smashed the mechanism. After a booming rumble, the water curtain flowed down once again. Shen Qingqiu sat in his original place, looking up in complete puzzlement. He had already been reduced to a prisoner in Luo Binghe’s grasp, so where did Luo Binghe’s anger come from?"
"好好一个溶洞被打得四壁坑坑洼洼 , 洛冰河才总算出够了气。 他一转身，沈清秋仍处于无所事事的围观状态。 洛冰河太阳穴似乎有一根青筋跳了几下 , 他咬牙道： “…… 我倒要亲眼看着，一个月后，你 怎么身败名裂！ ” 掷下这一句 , 他便拂袖而去 , 离开溶洞口时狠狠一掌劈在机关上，轰轰作响，水帘飞流直 下。沈清秋坐在原地，望望天。 为什么这么生气？总不至于是觉得被冤枉了吧。 金兰城这段剧情，因为原著的时间线上 , 这时候男主应该还在地下练级，所以根本没出现 过，上帝视角无法开启。可原作中，有一点是能够确定的：那就是洛冰河练级完毕、重回 地面以后的一切阴谋和屠戮，全都跟他脱不了关系。 所以，怎么想，嫌疑最大的都是他。 可同时，洛冰河其人，只有在有必要伪装的时候，才会费心思伪装。对于单手就能碾死的 蝼蚁，他一般没有花言巧语哄骗的兴趣。 显然现在的沈清秋 = 蝼蚁。 沈清秋想不通就不想了。 本来他也不是善于推理的那类人，而且顶多再过一个月，就能撒丫子欢脱地奔向全新天地 了。何必多想！ 溶洞中阴嗖嗖的，冷风一吹，湿衣贴着皮肤，冰得沈清秋结结实实打了个哆嗦。 洛冰河的外袍还扔在他旁边地上。 方才洛冰河甩袖而退那怒气冲冲的模样，居然让他看到了点以往小绵羊的影子。 虽说其实清静峰学艺期间的洛冰河，从来不会有乱发脾气的时候，更别提如今这样喜怒无 常了，可就是感觉 …… 有点儿像。 沈清秋想了想，还是勉强用手指夹住那件黑衣，磨磨蹭蹭披身上去了。 没办法，不是他刚才口嫌体正直，而是在洛冰河面前，他根本做不来这个动作。 原作每次啪啪啪完事后洛冰河给妹子披的不就这件衣服么？！ 当着男主的面，让他怎么下得去手！ 沈清秋发现，只要他想打个坐或者冥想一下，总是会有各种各样的外界干扰。比如在灵犀 洞那次，再比如水牢这次。 两天之内，到访三人。他暂押的这个豪华特惠单间，绝对是幻花宫水牢建立以来人气最红 火的一间了！ 石道升起，腐水断流。公仪萧匆匆穿过石道，才看了沈清秋一眼，就脚底打了个滑。 他结结巴巴道： “ 沈 …… 沈 …… 沈前辈，你 ……” 沈清秋不觉有异： “ 我怎么了？ ” 公仪萧表情怪异，看动作，好像不知道该不该转身回避，迟疑地定在了石台之外，没继续 前进。沈清秋顺着他目光往下看。 wtf ！ 昨天裂衣之后一直披着洛冰河的外套啊艹！ 公仪萧迟疑道： “ 那件好像是 ……” 沈清秋： “ 咳。 ” 公仪萧这才反应过来，忙也跟着咳了一声，道： “ 沈前辈这两日过得如何。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 尚可。 ” 没这么多人来拜访就好了。 公仪萧道： “ 听说昨日洛师兄 …… 离开时大发雷霆，晚辈还担心他会不会对沈前辈做什么 ……” 他嘴里说着话，眼睛却不由自主往那件外袍上飘。 沈清秋被他盯得情不自禁把胸前的袍子紧了紧。 能做什么啊？！乱发脾气天南地北打了一通，打塌了半个洞而已。你那是什么眼神！想太 多了少年！ 沈清秋忍不住道： “ 洛冰河 …… 他现在在幻花宫，究竟是何种身份？ ” 为什么他能在别人的地盘上大发雷霆还不受指责？ 公仪萧愣了愣，苦笑道： “ 晚辈也说不清楚。不过，有一点倒是可以确定，若非他执意不 肯拜师，恐怕如今首座弟子的位置，就轮不到我头上了。 ” 真惨啊。 沈清秋无限同情，对自己戳了人家伤疤深感愧疚。 公仪萧正色道： “ 晚辈此次前来，是有要事。尚峰主今早向师父申请过通行腰牌，只是被 延扣下来了，不知什么时候才能批过。他似乎有急事，便让晚辈带了一封信进来。 ” 说着 ，伸手入怀。 一封信卧槽！ 而且就只草草折了两道，连个火漆或者咒封都没加。 尚清华，你牛！ 公仪萧道： “ 前辈请放心，这封信我看过了。 ” 那还放心个头啊？！ 公仪萧接着道： “ 不过没看懂。 ” 沈清秋暗暗松了口气。好吧，看来是他误解了，尚清华不至于大条成这样，多半在信里使 用的是暗号，即便是被人截了也不怕。 沈清秋两根手指抖开那张纸。一眼扫过去，脸青了，看完两行，脸又白了，各种颜色在脸 上交错开花，好不热闹。 沈清秋： “……” 这封信是用英文写的。 而且是用错陋百出的 glish 写的。 完完全全的中式语法，不会的单词还用拼音代替了。 向天打飞机菊苣你就没考虑过万一我看不懂你的厕所式英语该怎么办吗？！ 连蒙带猜出这玩意儿的大概意思后，沈清秋手上一用内劲，纸张碎成渣渣，宛如六月飞雪 片片落地，正如他此刻沧桑的心境。 原来他还是太小看向天打飞机菊苣了。 “ 绝世黄瓜亲启： 都搞定了，准备妥当。地点不变。只不过时间上出现了一点小小的意外。为了让日月露华 芝尽快成熟，我弄了点别的东西来催熟，一不小心就催过头了，现在它已经熟的不能再熟 了，最多一个星期就要烂掉了，所以希望你能尽快从幻花宫水牢里面出来。放心，只是一 点点类似化学肥料的东西，用起来不会有什么差别的。应该。 ” 这哪里是不靠谱，这个人生命里有谱这种东西吗？！ 这才刚被关进来就要想办法出去！早知道就让柳清歌和师兄他们砍价砍成五天算了，说什 么一个月！还有那种纯天然无公害的绿色植物他居然敢用化学肥料催熟！催熟的！ “ 用起 来不会有什么差别的 ” 这种保证，简直就跟大头奶粉厂商的保证一样值得信赖！ 公仪萧四下看看，道： “ 前辈，你看完了吗？看完的话，就请把信投入湖中销毁。其实洛 师兄昨天吩咐过，除他以外谁也不许进来，晚辈须得尽早离开，以免被发现了节外生 枝。 ” 沈清秋一把抓住公仪萧： “ 帮我个忙。 ” 公仪萧道： “ 前辈请说，只要我 ……” 沈清秋不等他那句 “ 力所能及 ” 说出来，真诚道： “ 让我出去。 ” 公仪萧： “……” 沈清秋严肃道： “ 我认真的。 ” 公仪萧艰难道： “ 前辈 …… 这个真的不行。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 我有非离开不可的理由。绝不是想逃避四派联审。事毕之后，我自会重回水 牢，等候发落。如果你不相信，我们可以立下血誓。 ” 血誓不可翻悔。但实际上，露华芝事毕之后，沈清秋回不回幻花宫水牢，都没有关系了。 公仪萧为难道： “ 我当然相信前辈，可前辈不是主要要求下押水牢的吗？究竟是什么事， 严重到非离开不可？ ” 沈清秋刚要张嘴，却忽然惊觉，不能拜托他。 毕竟，公仪萧是幻花宫弟子，私纵犯人潜逃，安到谁身上都不是小罪。况且公仪萧这小伙 子人还不错，七天时限，机会应该还有的是，坑谁也不能坑他。刚才一时头脑发热没考虑 好，确实不应该。他忙道： “ 不。算了。就此打住，也不是什么大不了的事。 ” 说着勉强去 拢地上的碎纸片，投入湖中销毁证据。 因被捆仙索缠着大半个身体，动作极不方便，没动两下，那件黑衣从身上滑落。 公仪萧原本也在低头帮忙，见黑袍委地，无意间抬眼一看，当场手脚僵硬。 沈清秋： “…… ？ ” 他身上那件白衫从肩膀裂得整整齐齐，一瞧就知道是被人用暴力赤手撕开的。此外，还有 零零碎碎的衣料挂着，看起来像是鞭子抽的，破损处露出的白皙皮肉上，偶尔能看到微红 的擦伤。仔细看，喉咙上还有轻微的於痕未消。 公仪萧三观受到了毁灭性打击。 他颤声道： “ 前辈 …… 你 …… 你当真不要紧吗？ ” 难怪洛冰河命令除他以外的人都不许进来，就算有通行腰牌也不行，还扣下了尚峰主的申 请。 原来如此！ 简直逆徒！ 丧尽天良！ 禽兽不如！ 公仪萧心中为沈前辈流下血泪。沈前辈却茫然道： “ 我不要紧啊？ ” 公仪萧心中大震：为什么 …… 为什么到这种时候，沈前辈还能露出这种淡然的表情！ 沈清秋把纸张碎片尽数投入湖中，道： “ 刚才我说的话你不必放在心上。你 ……” 公仪萧霍然站起，转身就走！ 沈清秋满脸黑线：说让你不放在心上你就直接走人了啊？也太干脆了吧？！ 谁知，半个时辰未过，公仪萧又回来了。他手拎着一样东西，走到沈清秋面前，拆了上面 的缠裹和封条，拔出，斜挥而下。 白芒一闪，沈清秋感觉全身骤然一松，仿佛猛地被接通了电路。指节屈伸，灵力运转无误 ，收发自如，上次莫名其妙发作的无可解毒性，被捆仙索绑了两天，似乎得到了抑制，莫 非是以毒攻毒、负负得正的道理？ 捆仙索段段坠地，公仪萧将手中之物投下，沈清秋伸手接住。 修雅剑！ 沈清秋握住它，喜出望外又诧异，看向公仪萧： “ 我以为它该是被收到老宫主那里了。 ” 公仪萧凛然道： “ 就算拼着被师父责罚，晚辈也不能坐视前辈受辱而无动于衷。我相信沈 前辈，请跟我来！ ” 沈清秋油然而生一种无力之感。 那啥 …… 总觉得 …… 他似乎误会了什么很重要的东西 …… 但是 …… 算了吧 …… 就这样吧 …… 沈清秋果断道： “ 好！ ” 虽然他体内的天魔之血尚在蛰伏，无论跑到哪儿，洛冰河都能知道他在哪儿。 不过，知道他在哪儿不要紧。追不上他就行！","CHAPTER 39: ESCAPE FROM THE WATER PRISON The inside of the cave was dark and gloomy. Whenever the cold wind blew, Shen Qingqiu’s wet clothes would stick to his skin, making him shiver violently. To one side, Luo Binghe’s outer robe still lay tossed on the ground. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but get caught up in a bout of nostalgia. Even though Luo Binghe never got angry during the time that he trained Qing Jing Peak, unlike his current explosive temper, just then the way he looked when he retreated in a rage after Shen Qingqiu threw off his robe unexpectedly made Shen Qingqiu see a shadow of the little sheep he used to be. After his bout of nostalgia, a vicious burst of cold made him want to sneeze. Shen Qingqiu didn’t have a better option, so he might as well grab that black robe and slowly pull it over his body. There was nothing that could be done. After all, by refusing Luo Binghe’s robe he was not expressing self-righteous distastehe simply couldn’t do this sort of thing in front of Luo Binghe. In the original work, didn’t Luo Binghe give girls this very robe each time after sex? What sort of indignity would this be in front of the protagonist! Shen Qingqiu discovered that every time he sat to meditate, there would always be some form of outside interference. It happened that time at Ling Xi cave, and again now in the water dungeon. The stone path rose and the water curtain stopped flowing. Gongyi Xiao hurriedly ran over the path, only managing to glance at Shen Qingqiu before his feet slipped under him. He stammered, “S… s… Elder Shen, you…” Shen Qingqiu didn’t notice anything strange. “What about me?” Gongyi Xiao had a strange look on his face like he didn’t know whether or not he should turn around and retreat. He hesitated outside of the stone platform and didn’t continue to advance. Following his gaze, Shen Qingqiu looked down. Gongyi Xiao said, hesitantly, “Those clothes, aren’t they…” Shen Qingqiu sighed. Luo Binghe’s outer robes. Gongyi Xiao finally reacted. He hurriedly coughed, then asked, “How has Elder Shen been these past two days?” Shen Qingqiu replied, “Satisfactory.” You don’t need to pay this much attention to me! Within the space of two days, three people had already visited.During this temporary detainment, he had been receiving such luxurious treatment. Huan Hua Temple must have upgraded their water dungeon recently to include such exceptional hospitality! Gongyi Xiao said, “I heard that last night Luo Shixiong… was in a terrible rage when he left, so this junior was worried that he might have done something to Elder Shen…” As he spoke, his eyes couldn’t help but linger on the black outer robe. Under his stare, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but pull the robe tighter over his chest. What could he do? Luo Binghe had only thrown a tantrum and knocked holes all over the place 142 , knocking over half the cave. What’s with that look in your eye! Shen Qingqiu sighed. “Luo Binghe is really like a fish back in water 143 at Huan Hua Temple.” Gongyi Xiao laughed bitterly. “Not only that, but Luo Shixiong’s spiritual power is outstanding, his conduct is unwavering, and his actions swift and decisive 144 . Other people are left in the dustit’s no wonder Shizun regards him so highly. If he weren’t so insistent on not becoming a formal disciple, I’m afraid it would never be my turn to take the place of the head disciple.” Seeing the look on his face, Shen Qingqiu could sincerely sympathize. Gongyi Xiao resolutely said, “This junior came to see you for an important matter. This morning, Peak Lord Shang requested a passage waist card from my master but was delayed by other matters and didn’t know when he could slip away. He seemed like he had some pressing business and let this junior bring in a letter.” He reached into his bosom, where a letter was nestled. Not only was the letter just hastily folded twice, but it also didn’t have a wax seal or a seal spell. Shang Qinghua, how courageous! Gongyi Xiao said, “Please relax, Elder, I’ve already looked through this letter.” Relax my ass! Gongyi Xiao continued, “However, I couldn’t understand what it was saying.” Shen Qingqiu inwardly released a held breath. Good, it looked like he misread the situation. Shang Qinghua wouldn’t fuck up this badly. He most likely used some sort of secret code in the letter, so there was nothing to feareven if someone had intercepted it. Shen Qingqiu shook open the paper with two fingers. After skimming it, his face turned green. After reading two lines, his face turned white. All sorts of colors bloomed on his face and crisscrossed with each other in a lively show. Shen Qingqiu: “…” This letter was written in English. Not only that, it was written in horrible Chinglish 145 that was full of errors 146 . The grammar was entirely Chinese, and uncommon words were just replaced by their Pinyin equivalents. Great author Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky, did you not consider the possibility that I can’t understand your toilet-tier English? After putting together the pieces of the puzzle to guess the meaning of this message, Shen Qingqiu directed his energy to his hand. The paper broke into fragments and floated to the floor like snow in Junejust like his mental state after enduring the rollercoaster of events that occurred the past few days. As it turns out, it was him who underestimated Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky. For Peerless Cucumber’s 147 eyes only: Everything is set, all the appropriate preparations have been made. The place has not changed. There was only a small mishap with the time. In order to let the Sun and Moon Dew Flower Seed mature as soon as possible, I got a little something to help it ripen but accidentally overdid it. Right now, it’s as ripe as it will ever get and will rot in no more than a week, so I hope you can leave Huan Hua Temple’s water prison as soon as possible. Don’t worry, it was only something like chemical fertilizer, there shouldn’t be any difference when using it. I hope. What do you mean a little deviation from the plan? Was there even anything close to a plan in this person’s head? You dare use chemical fertilizer to ripen that green plant that could be harmed by the pure sky? Just to ripen it! “There shouldn’t be any difference when using it”this sort of guarantee is as trustworthy as the producers of powdered milk to enlarge your baby’s head! Gongyi Xiao looked around and said, “Elder, are you done reading? If you have, please toss the letter into the lake to destroy it. In fact, last night Luo Shixiong issued an order that allowed no one but him to enter the prison. This junior must leave as early as possible in order to avoid being discovered.Shen Qingqiu grabbed Gongyi Xiao and said, “Do me a favor.” Gongyi Xiao responded, “Please ask, as long as I…” Shen Qingqiu didn’t wait for him to finish with “can do it,” and sincerely asked, “Let me out.” “…” Gongyi Xiao said with difficulty, “Elder, this is really out of the question.” Shen Qingqiu said solemnly, “I have a reason to insist on leaving. I absolutely am not thinking of escaping trial by the four sects. After finishing my affairs, I will return to the water prison myself to await judgment. If you don’t believe me, we can establish a blood oath.” One could not renege on a blood oath, but it didn’t really matter whether or not Shen Qingqiu returned to Huan Hua Temple’s water prison after completing his affairs. So, he was playing an immoral trick on Gongyi Xiao. Gongyi Xiao said awkwardly, “I certainly believe you, but isn’t it of primary concern for Elder to stay detained in the water prison? What sort of thing is critical enough that you absolutely have to leave? If Elder Shen is willing to explain, I could inform everyone participating in the investigation…” Shen Qingqiu had some second thoughts. Gongyi Xiao was a Huan Hua Sect disciple, and to be involved in the escape of a prisoner was no small sin on anyone’s head. This was a pretty upstanding youngster, and it wouldn’t be kind to defraud him. Within the limit of seven days, there were bound to be additional opportunities. Consequently, he changed his tone and said, “You had better not. It wasn’t any worst-case scenario anyway.” As he spoke, he collected all the paper fragments on the ground with difficulty, tossing them into the lake to destroy the evidence. Because most of his body was wrapped by the Immortal-Binding Cables, movement was extremely difficult. Before having shifted twice, the black robe had slid off his body. Gongyi Xiao had originally bent down to help, but after seeing that black robe cast aside to the ground, he unintentionally raised his head to take a look. His arms and legs went rigid at the scene. Shen Qingqiu: “….?” The white garment on his body had been neatly ripped from his shoulder. It was obvious from a glance that someone had violently ripped it open with their bare hands. In addition, there were fragments of material left hanging, looking like they had been pulled out by a whip. On the fair skin left exposed bythe damage, there were more than a few pale red scrapes. If one looked closely, there were also faint traces on his neck which had not yet faded. Gongyi Xiao’s worldview received a devastating shock. He said in a trembling voice, “Elder, you… are you sure it’s nothing urgent?” No wonder Luo Binghe had ordered that no one but him was allowed to entereven if they had the passage waist cardand blocked even Peak Lord Shang’s attempts. So it’s like this! Simply a rebellious disciple! Devoid of conscience! Worse than a beast! Gongyi Xiao inwardly cried tears of blood for Elder Shen. Shen Qingqiu himself said, vacantly, “It’s nothing urgent?” Gongyi Xiao was secretly moved. How… how can Elder Shen show this kind of indifferent expression even in this kind of moment! Sheng Qingqiu finished tossing all the paper fragments into the lake and said, “You don’t need to take the words I said just now to heart. You…” Gongyi Xiao suddenly stood up, turned around, then left! Shen Qingqiu’s expression turned gloomy. I just said you don’t need to take me seriously and you just immediately leave? Isn’t this a bit too blunt? Who knew that before an hour had passed, Gongyi Xiao would return with an object in his hand. He walked over to Shen Qingqiu, undid the seals binding it, and waved it in a slanted motion. With the flash of a white blade, the bindings around Shen Qingqiu’s body abruptly loosened, feeling similar to an electric circuit had suddenly been connected. Stretching his fingers, his spiritual energy was unmistakably back in operation and flowing smoothly. Last time it had mysteriously been blocked by the poison, but after being bound by Immortal-Binding Cables for two days the poison had unexpectedly been suppressed again. Could it have been a fighting fire with fire, two negatives make a positive kind of principle? The Immortal-Binding Cables dropped to the ground in pieces. Gongyi Xiao tossed over the thing in his hands, and Shen Qingqiu reached out his hand to catch it. The Xiu Ya Sword! Holding the sword, Shen Qingqiu was overjoyed and astonished. Looking at Gongyi Xiao, he said, “I thought this was supposed to be with the Old PalaceMaster.” Gongyi Xiao said in an apprehensive tone, “Even if I risk being punished by my master, this junior could not sit aloof while Senior is disgraced. I believe Senior Shen, please follow me!” Shen Qingqiu involuntarily felt a sense of helplessness. That… I keep feeling like… he seems to have misunderstood something significant… But… forget about it… this is fine… Shen Qingqiu said decisively, “Good!” Although the demonic blood in his body was still dormant, Luo Binghe would be able to know where he had gone no matter where he ran. However, it didn’t matter if he knew where he was as long as Luo Binghe couldn’t chase him there! Gongyi Xiao said, deeply worried, “Senior, you… can you walk? Do you need me to carry…” Shen Qingqiu’s face darkened and he took a step, quickly moving his body to prove that he could in fact walk, and walk very quickly at that! Gongyi Xiao startled, then promptly followed close behind. Unexpectedly, when the two stepped outside the limit of the stone platform and onto the path, the water curtain which had just been raised started spraying water with a boom. Shen Qingqiu ran but stopped quickly, or else he would have been caught head-on by the water. The two stepped back onto the stone platform, and the water curtain retreated again. It was like something was deliberately preventing them from leaving. Isn’t this a bit too well-designed? Gongyi Xiao suddenly said, “I forgot, once the water prison has been activated, there must be someone on the stone platform; if this person leaves and there isn’t enough weight on the platform, the water curtain will automatically reactivate even if the mechanism has shut off.” He didn’t have the experience of helping a prisoner escape, so it was natural that he did not remember this sort of matter. Shen Qingqiu said, “In other words, there has to be one person left on the stone platform before the others can leave?” Gongyi Xiao nodded. Shen Qingqiu said, “Then you stay here.” Gongyi Xiao: “…” After saying this, he flicked his sleeves and headed towards the outside. Behind, Gongyi Xiao weakly raised his hand and said, “Senior Shen, eventhough junior is very willing to helpbut, if you don’t have me to lead the way, I’m afraid you won’t be able to escape… ah…” Shen Qingqiu looked back and added, “Wait for me to come back.” Gongyi Xiao blankly stood in the same place. He had half a mind to follow but was hindered by the fact that he had no way of leaving the limits of the stone platform and had no alternative but to wait quietly. In a short amount of time, he heard a muffled sound from outside. Shen Qingqiu walked in dragging a person by the back of his neck. Shen Qingqiu dragged the still unconscious pocked-face disciple onto the stone platform, patted Gongyi Xiao on the shoulder, and said, “I happened to see this one on patrol and borrowed him for a bit. Let’s go!” In reality, he didn’t just “happen” to see him. There were four people on patrol, and Shen Qingqiu had hidden in a dark place and carefully selected this mouthy disciple!"
"公仪萧忧心忡忡 , 道： “ 前辈，你 …… 你走得了吗？需不需要我背 ……” 沈清秋黑着脸一步迈开 , 飞身而出，用行动证明自己很好、非常好！ 公仪萧一愣，连忙紧随其后。谁知 , 两人堪堪跨离石台范围，踩上石道，刚刚已经被升起 的腐水帘轰的一声 , 喷出水来。 沈清秋跑得快，刹得也快，否则就被浇个正着了，两人退回石台之上，水帘却又渐渐阻 断。 简直就是存心不让他们离开。这也太智能了吧？！ 公仪萧恍然道： “ 我忘了 , 一旦水牢启用，石台上就必须留有一人；一旦这一人离开，石台 上重量不足，即便关闭了机关，也会自动接通水帘。 ” 以往他从来没有过带犯人逃逸的经 历，自然不会记得这种事。 沈清秋道： “ 就是说一定要有一个人留在石台上，其他的人才能走出去？ ” 公仪萧点头。沈清秋道： “ 你留在这里。 ” 公仪萧： “……” 说完甩袖就往外走。公仪萧在后面弱弱地举手道： “ 沈前辈 …… 虽然晚辈很愿意效劳，不 过，没有我带路，你恐怕走不出去 …… 啊 ……” 沈清秋回了个头，补充道： “ 等我回来。 ” 公仪萧呆立原地，有心跟上去，却碍于无法离开石台范围，只得静静等待。不到片刻，只 听外边一声闷响，沈清秋拎着个人的后脖子拖了进来。 沈清秋把那昏迷不醒的小麻子脸弟子拖上了石台，拍拍公仪萧肩膀，道： “ 刚好见他在巡 逻，借来一用，我们走！ ” 其实不是 “ 刚好 ” ，巡逻的有四个人，沈清秋潜伏在暗处，可是经过精挑细选才选中了这 个！ 公仪萧刚才也想过要随便抓个弟子来充作秤砣，但也只是隐约闪过的念头，眼下沈清秋已 经自己做了，不用他出手打晕同门，不由舒了口气。两人并肩往外走，又见沈清秋拢了拢 披在身外的那件黑袍，喉间一阵梗塞。 他心中难过道：沈前辈尊为一峰之首，被困受辱，已经是无可奈何，而眼下却还要靠着对 他不敬之人的衣服才能蔽体遮羞，真是 …… 真是令人痛心！ 沈清秋见他眼神闪动，似是同情，又似悲愤，只能以面无表情不变应万变。 又开始。他又开始了！ 忽然，公仪萧道： “ 前辈，请脱掉！ ” 沈清秋： “……” 啥？！ 不等他反应过来，公仪萧已经开始脱自己的外袍。沈清秋正在考虑要不要朝他扔个暴击看 看是怎么回事，公仪萧已经把自己脱下来的外衣双手呈递了过来，道： “ 请穿这件吧！ ” 沈清秋恍然大悟。 哦！原来是这个意思。洛冰河的衣服虽然是黑色的，但是衣如其人，它就跟男主本身一样 低调奢华有内涵，穿在身上毕竟还是太显眼了。换一件撞衫率相对更高的白衣，比较有利 于逃跑对吧？ 想得太周到了！ 他果断脱了洛冰河的外衣，换上公仪萧那件。临走前想了想，还是把洛冰河的衣服给叠好 了，这才放到地上 …… 离开溶洞，公仪萧在前，沈清秋自然不消千叮万嘱，自觉紧随其后。 刚开始还不觉得有什么难走的，可越往外走，就越是觉得着幻花宫迷阵果然可怕得很，一 洞接一洞，一道错一道，三步九绕，直绕得人头晕眼花，明明公仪萧背影近在眼前，可好 几次都险些跟丢。要不是公仪萧对水牢人手分布和日程安排了如指掌，恐怕早就不知撞上 几队巡逻的守阵弟子了。 洛冰河命令除他之外，不允许其他任何人私探水牢，大大有利于逃跑。因为，只要他本人 不来，就没人会知道那件牢房关的人已经溜之大吉了。是以，半个时辰后，两人终于绕出 了地底水牢，片刻不停地往外走了好几里，进入白露林，就快离开幻花宫的地界了，水牢 的警钟还没被撞响，也就是说，到现在也没人发现犯人跑了。 这么看来，只要有个地位足够高信息掌握足够充分的内应，越狱根本小事一桩！ 在白露林休息片刻，沈清秋道： “ 公仪公子，到这里就不必再送了。趁现在没被发觉，你 快回去吧。 ” 顿了顿，他补充道： “ 七天之内，你到花月城，定能在那里找到我。 ” 公仪萧道： “ 前辈都这么说了，我还能说什么呢？虽然不知是什么事，但此去请千万小 心。 ” 沈清秋点头道： “ 还有一事。请公仪公子代我转告百战峰柳师弟。请他立刻前往花月城！ ” 公仪萧道： “ 定当转告。一月之后的四派联审，前辈请放心，如您所说，清者自清，诸位 掌门必会为您洗刷冤屈。 ” 沈清秋忍不住笑了。 第一，黑历史涮不掉，第二，一个月后的四派联审关他屁事哈哈哈哈 …… 当下胸中豪气万 千，也一抱手： “ 后会有期！ ” 公仪萧忽然道： “ 等等！ ” 沈清秋回头： “ 何事？ ” 公仪萧笑道： “ 若后会有期，前辈一定要履行承诺，带我去清静峰一览。晚辈可一直等着 呢。 ” 分道扬镳后，沈清秋御剑了一段路程，终于发现了一个问题。 从幻花宫边界出发，到花月城一路，途径了中原人口最密集、经济水平最发达的一片区 域。 这两个条件也就意味着，在此区域的俗家修真门派和世家密度非常大。 这个世界的修真人士对空防是很重视的。就如金兰城一样，他们通常都会在自己地盘的上 方设立防空结界。如果有仙剑或法器用超过限制的速度飞过，无疑会被发现，并且通告本 门上级。 可想而知，简直就像拿着大喇叭在高调宣扬自己的逃窜路线。 就是说他还是得飞一段走一段！ 沈清秋真想拿这书里一堆狗屁不通的设定狂扇向天打飞机的脸：坑爹呢你？！ 沈清秋日月不休，终于在第三天赶到了花月城。 只是他来的十分不巧。 此时正值花月城建城祭典，彻夜灯火通明，花灯结彩。街头飞龙舞狮，鼓乐震天。人挤着 人，摊挨着摊，到处溜着货郎担。几乎像是所有的人都从家里出来了。 更不巧的是，他赶到时，乌云闭月。 如无日月天光加持，此行的失败几率会大大增加。沈清秋觉得够呛，决定还是暂且等上一 等。最多一天。如果一天之内，云雾还不散去，就管不了那么多了。失败几率大点就大点 ，总比抱着熟过头的日月露华芝哭要强，到时候拿它炒菜下酒都嫌不好吃。 沈清秋慢慢走着，不时就能撞上谁家嬉闹的顽童，和笑作一团的少女们擦肩而过，略感可 惜。要不是正亡命奔逃，也能在这城里好好游玩一番。 忽然，迎面走来几名背负长剑，身着统一服色的男子，个个昂首挺胸，一看就是趾高气扬 的杂派弟子。 说起来也奇怪，越是那些杂门小派的弟子，越是生怕别人不知道自己是修真之人，恨不得 在衣服上绣出字样来才好。 沈清秋自然地转了个身，顺手从旁边抄了个鬼面，罩在脸上，大大方方迎着他们走过去。 祭典中十个有六个游人都是戴着面具的，混在其中，倒也不怕显眼。 只听其中一男子道： “ 师兄，那修雅剑真的会在这城里干等着别人来抓？ ” 为首那人呵斥道： “ 四派联合发出的追缉令，还能有假？没见多少门派都派人过来围堵了 吗？盯紧了，幻花宫的悬赏你们也看到了，不想要？ ” 卧槽，原来被通缉了，究竟在他不知道时候，已经有多少人往这边赶来了！ “ 也难怪幻花宫下这么大血本，要说他们也真是够惨哪 ……” 沈清秋心道我顶多就是打晕了幻花宫一个小小弟子，又没干别的什么，怎么幻花宫就成这 么苦情的受害者了？ 他有心继续再听，那几人却越走越远，沈清秋被人流冲得东倒西歪，只得放弃，正琢磨着 找个废宅歇歇脚，忽然腿上一重，低头，只见一个小童抱住了他的大腿。 这孩子慢慢仰起脸来，脸色苍白，像是营养不良，眼睛却又大又亮，就这么直直看着他， 抱着他大腿不肯撒手。 沈清秋摸了摸他的头： “ 你是谁家的？走散了？ ” 小孩儿点了点头，一开口，声音软软糯糯的： “ 走散了。 ” 沈清秋见他生得可爱，还似乎有点眼熟，便弯腰，一把将他抱了起来，让他坐在自己手臂 上： “ 是谁带你出来的？ ” 小朋友搂住他的脖子，抿了抿嘴，委屈道： “ 和师父 ……” 沈清秋不知为何，觉得这孩子特别招人怜。他拍了拍软绵绵的小屁股，道： “ 师父没看好 你，良心大大的坏。怎么走散的，记得吗？ ” 小童在他耳边嘻嘻笑道： “ 师父亲自把我一掌打下去的，怎么不记得了？ ” 这句话一出来，沈清秋登时半边身子都凉了。 沈清秋觉得自己抱着的，不是一具幼童身体，而是一条毒蛇，一条盘在他脖子上，亮起獠 牙，随时都会咬他一口、注入毒液的巨蛇！他猛地把手中之人抛了出去，带着一背的鸡皮 疙瘩一转身，刹那浑身的寒毛都直刺刺倒立起来。 整条街的人都在看着他。 戴着面具的，没戴面具的，都仿佛在瞬间静止了，屏住呼吸看着他。 戴着面具的，脸上鬼面狰狞可怖；而没戴面具的，则更让人的慌  他们没有脸！","CHAPTER 40: ESCAPING DEATH AT HUAYUE PART 1 Just then, Gongyi Xiao had also thought of grabbing a random disciple and using them as a weight, but it was only a fleeting idea. Since Shen Qingqiu went ahead and did it on his own, Gongyi Xiao breathed a sigh of relief for not having to knock out someone from his own sect. The two of them walked out together. Seeing Shen Qingqiu gather the black robe closer around himself again, Gongyi Xiao felt as if there was a lump in his throat. Gongyi Xiao couldn’t help but feel sorry for him. Though Shen Qingqiu was a Peak Lord, there was nothing he could do about being imprisoned and disgraced. Not only that, he could only cover himself up with the clothing of the same person who humiliated him. It really made people sigh with regret and pity! Shen Qingqiu saw that Gongyi Xiao’s eyes seemed to flicker with sympathy and something like grief and indignation. He could only react by remaining expressionless. Suddenly, Gongyi Xiao said, “Elder, please take it off!” Shen Qingqiu: “…” What? Without waiting for him to recover, Gongyi Xiao already started to take off his own outer robe. Shen Qingqiu was considering whether or not he should throw a critical hit at him to wake him up, but Gongyi Xiao had already taken off his outer robe and presented it to him with both hands. He said, “Please wear this one!” Shen Qingqiu suddenly saw the light. Oh, so this is what he meant. Even though Luo Binghe’s clothes were black, the clothing was similar to the person. It had the same low-key extravagant connotation that the protagonist himself did, and all in all, it was still very conspicuous if he wore it. If he changed into a common white robe, it would be quite beneficial to his escape, right? Gongyi Xiao was too thoughtful. He resolutely took off Luo Binghe’s outer robe and changed into Gongyi Xiao’s. Before he left, he thought a bit and folded Luo Binghe’s clothes neatly before placing it onto the floor… After leaving the water dungeon, he initially felt that the path wasn’t all that difficult to walk. But the further they walked, the more he felt that HuanHua Palace’s maze was indeed very terrifying. It was all one cave connected to the next, one path interlocked with the next, circling nine times with every three steps, circling around until it made someone’s head spin. Gongyi Xiao’s back was clearly right in front of him, but he only narrowly avoided losing him on several occasions. If it weren’t for the fact that Gongyi Xiao knew the distribution of the water dungeon’s guards and their daily schedule like the back of his hand, who knew how many teams of patrolling disciples they would have run into by now? Half an hour later, the two of them finally made it out of the underground water dungeon. They walked quite a few kilometers without stopping until they entered Bailu Forest. Even though they were about to leave Huan Hua Palace’s territory, the water dungeon’s alarm bell still hadn’t sounded, which meant that up to now they still hadn’t discovered that the prisoner escaped. Luo Binghe’s command that nobody else besides him could investigate the water dungeon had, in actuality, greatly helped Shen Qingqiu’s escape. After resting for a moment, Shen Qingqiu said, “Lord Gongyi, there’s no need to accompany me any further. You should take advantage of the fact that we haven’t been discovered yet and go back quickly.” He paused a little before adding, “In seven days, if you go to Huayue City, you will definitely be able to find me there.” Gongyi Xiao said, “Since it’s like this, I won’t escort you any further. Although Elder knows what to do even after what happened today, please be extremely careful. And regarding the trial that will be held by the four factions in a month, please don’t worry, Elder. As you said, innocent people will naturally be cleared. The lords and the rest will definitely clear your name of injustice.” Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but laugh. First of all, his dark past was final and couldn’t be washed off. Second, he didn’t give a damn about the trial that was going to be held by the four factions in a month hahaha… Immediately, yet leisurely, he cupped his hands in respect. “We’ll meet again.” The path from the edge of Huan Hua Palace’s territory to Huayue City went straight through the region of the Central Plains, where the population was the densest and the economy was the most prosperous. This also meant that there was an extremely large number of cultivating sects and clans in the region. The cultivators of this world greatly valued air defense. Just like Jinlan City, they would often create defensive formations in the sky above their territories. If a flying sword or spiritual weapon went over the speed limit as it flew across, it would undoubtedly be discovered, and the higher authorities ofthe sect would be notified as well. As one could imagine, it would be like broadcasting his escape route with a megaphone set at full volume. Shen Qingqiu flew part of the way and then walked without stopping to rest. Finally, he made it to Huayue City the next night. He came at an extremely unfortunate time. It just happened to be the festival celebrating the establishment of Huayue City, and festive lanterns decorated with garlands were kept brightly lit throughout the entire night. The streets were filled with flying dragons and lion dances, the music thunderous. People and vendors carrying their wares were squeezed together. Almost everyone had come out from their homes. What was even more unlucky: when he arrived, dark clouds were covering the moon. Without the support of moonlight or sunlight, the probability of failure would increase greatly. Shen Qingqiu felt that it was impossible, and he decided that for now, it would be better to wait, at most, one more day. If the clouds still didn’t disperse within a day, he couldn’t afford to care that much and wait any longer. If the probability of failure would increase, then it would just have to increase. In any case, it would be better than hugging an overripe Sun and Moon Dew Flower Seed and crying over it. He suspected that even if he made a dish out of it and served it with wine, it would still have a strong chemical taste. Shen Qingqiu walked along slowly, and he frequently ran into some family’s rambunctious children as they played. He brushed past laughing groups of young women and he felt a little bit of regret. If he wasn’t currently fleeing desperately, then he could sight-see and stroll along in the city as well. Suddenly, several men carrying long swords on their backs walked towards him, all wearing clothes of the same style and color. They all walked with their heads held high and chests puffed out, and with one glance he could tell that they were arrogant disciples from a mixture of sects. It was strange to say, but the smaller the sects that the disciples were from, the more they feared that others wouldn’t know that they were cultivators. They might as well have embroidered the word enormously onto their clothes. Shen Qingqiu turned naturally and conveniently picked up a demon mask from the side of the road before placing it on his face, calmly walking past them. Six out of every ten visitors at the festival were wearing masks, so he didn’t fear being too conspicuous when he was mixed among them. He heard one of the men ask, “Shixiong, is the Xiu Ya sword really in the city where someone could just comeand grab it?” The leader of the group berated, “This is the bounty that the alliance of the four factions sent out how could it be fake? Didn’t you see that a lot of the sects have sent people over here to surround the place? Look, you guys also saw the reward that Huan Hua Palace posted. Don’t you want it?” Thousands of thoughts flew around in Shen Qingqiu’s head. In the end, he had also unwittingly become a wanted man. “It’s no wonder that Huan Hua Palace put down such a big investment. If we’re gonna talk about them, then it’s also tragic enough…” Shen Qingqiu thought, At the most, all I did was knock out one lowly disciple from Huan Hua Palace. I didn’t even do anything else, so how did Huan Hua Palace become such a miserable victim? He wanted to continue listening, but those people walked further and further away until they were separated by the rush of people and he had to give up. Just when he was wondering whether he should find an abandoned house to rest at for a bit, one of his legs suddenly felt heavy. He looked down only to see a small child hugging his thigh. The child slowly raised his head. His face was pallid as if he was malnourished but his eyes were big and bright as he stared straight up at Shen Qingqiu, hugging his thigh and refusing to let go. Shen Qingqiu patted his head. “Which family are you from? Did you get lost?” The small child nodded, and when he opened his mouth, his voice was soft and meek. “Got lost.” Shen Qingqiu thought he was cute and looked a little familiar, so he bent down and lifted him up, letting him sit in the crook of his arm. “Who brought you out here?” The little boy hugged his neck and pressed his lips together. “With Shizun…” Could he be a young disciple from some sect? If an adult came looking for him, then it would be a problem. But for some reason, the child’s sad appearance as he said “Shizun” especially pulled at Shen Qingqiu’s heartstrings. He couldn’t harden his heart and just throw him onto the side of the road so that he could continue to squat there pitifully. He patted his soft little butt and said, “Shizun didn’t take care of you well; his conscience must be extremely bad. Do you remember where you got lost?” The small child giggled next to his ear. “I remember. Shizun personally shoved me down with one strikehow do you not remember?”Immediately, half of Shen Qingqiu’s body became cold. He felt as if what he was holding in his arms wasn’t a young child, but rather a poisonous snakean enormous snake that was coiled around his neck, baring its fangs. It could bite down at any moment and inject venom into him! He fiercely threw the person in his arms away from him and turned, goosebumps forming all over his back. In an instant, all of the fine hairs on his body stood straight up. All of the people on the street were looking at him. The ones wearing a mask and the ones not wearing a mask all seemed to be frozen in that second, holding their breaths as they watched him. Of the ones wearing a mask, the demon masks on their faces were ferocious and frightening; as for the ones without a mask, they were even more panic-inducingnone of them had a face! Shen Qingqiu’s first instinct was to place his hand on the Xiu Ya sword, but he instantly recovered. He couldn’t attack! This was what he had originally taught Luo Binghe. In the Dream Demon’s formation, if he attacked the “people” in the dream, it would be the same as attacking his own soul in reality. Cold sweat covered Shen Qingqiu’s forehead. He didn’t know when he had actually entered the scope of the formation, though people naturally wouldn’t be able to remember when or how the “dream” had started. It couldn’t be that his nerves had become so frayed that as he ran and ran, he had just fallen asleep on the side of the road, right? Behind him, a young and tender voice said, “Shizun.” Back then, when the voice was next to his ear, it had clearly been incomparably soft and sweetbut when he heard it now, it unexpectedly contained an unexplainable, sinister intent. Child Luo Binghe was behind him, and he said distantly, “Why don’t you want me anymore?” Shen Qingqiu resolutely didn’t look back and started walking away immediately! Though all of these faceless people were looking at himno, it couldn’t be called ‘looking,’ considering they didn’t even have eyes, but all of their faces were turned in Shen Qingqiu’s direction. He could certainly feel countless gazes on him. Shen Qingqiu pretended he couldn’t see them at all and charged forward abruptly. If there was anyone blocking his way, he shoved them aside. Suddenly,a hand cut off his strike. When he turned his head, he saw that although the hand was slender, it was so strong that it was scary; it was like an iron hoop. A fourteen-year-old Luo Binghe grasped his wrist tightly, and besides the bruising on his face that was often there year-round, his expression was full of dejection. Those pitch-black eyes stared closely at him. You’re still coming! Shen Qingqiu shook his arm three times before he broke free, pushing through the crowd as he ran. The first time was a child, the second time was a teenager. If an adult version came along, then he really wouldn’t be able to bear it anymore! But the street seemed to go on forever and he’d never reach the end. After the small stalls on both sides of the street appeared for the second time, along with the faceless children playing around and the young women wearing demon masks, Shen Qingqiu was finally sure that this road inside the dream was looping continuously. It was impossible to leave it by walking forward! Since going forwards or backward was useless, he would just have to find a new path. Shen Qingqiu looked left and right before moving quickly to the front of a wine shop. The big red lanterns were hung high in front of the wine shop’s door, the red light dim and alluring. The wooden doors were tightly closed, but Shen Qingqiu pulled them open and stepped inside. It was only when he completely stepped through that the two wooden doors slammed shut on their own. The inside of the room was pitch black and a cold wind brushed past him. It didn’t seem as if he was inside a wine shop, but instead a mountain cave. Shen Qingqiu didn’t find it unexpected though. You couldn’t use common sense to evaluate a dream. Every door held the possibility to lead to anywhere in the world. At that moment, he heard a series of strange sounds. There was a voice that seemed to belong to someone whose lungs had been punctured. They were continuously gasping for breath with extreme difficulty and utter agony. Moreover, it seemed that it wasn’t just one person! Shen Qingqiu snapped his fingers and a flame leaped out from the tips of his fingers, shooting towards the place where the strange sound had come from. The light of the fire completely illuminated the scene, and his pupils instantly shrank in shock. Liu Qingge held the Cheng Luan sword in his hand and pointed the bladeat himself before plunging it into his own chest."
"不能攻击！ 沈清秋刹那间第一反应就是把手按到修雅剑上 , 可立即反应过来 , 不能攻击！ 这还是他当初教过洛冰河的，在梦魔结界范围之内，攻击梦境中的 “ 人 ” ，实际上是在攻击 自己的神智。 沈清秋额头沁出冷汗。他居然完全没发现是从什么时候进入结界范围内的。正逃跑呢，他 总不至于跑着跑着在路边睡着了吧？ 虽说 , 人本来就不会记得 ,“ 梦 ” 是从什么时候、如何开始的。 身后，一个稚嫩的声音传来： “ 师尊。 ” 这声音刚才在耳边分明无比软糯可爱，可现在听来 , 居然有一股说不出的森然之意。 幼年的洛冰河在他身后 , 幽幽地道： “ 为什么不要我了。 ” 沈清秋果断不回头，拔腿就走！ 这些无面之人虽说都在看着他，不对，不能说是看，因为他们根本没有眼睛，可脸都对着 沈清秋的方向，他的的确确能感受到无数视线投射过来。 沈清秋通通假装看不到，径自往前猛冲，有挡道的就一巴掌扇开。忽然，一只手截住了他 的掌风。转头一看，这只手虽然纤细，力量却大的可怕，简直像一只铁箍。 十四岁的洛冰河牢牢把他的手腕攥住，脸上除了常年不散的瘀伤，都是满溢的忧郁。那双 漆黑的眼睛直勾勾看着他，近在咫尺。 你还来！ 沈清秋甩了三次才甩脱，拨开人群继续往前跑。第一次是幼年，第二次是少年，再来个成 年版的，他就真扛不住了！可这条长街仿佛没有尽头，总也走不完。在道路两旁的小摊、 嬉戏的无脸顽童与鬼面少女们出现了第二次后，沈清秋终于确定了，梦境里的这条街，是 循环的！ 也就是说，往前走根本走不通。 既然前后不通，那就另辟蹊径。沈清秋左右望望，闪到一间酒肆之前。 酒肆门前大红灯笼高挂，红光幽艳，木门却紧紧闭着。沈清秋拉开大门，才刚迈进去，身 后两扇木门立即猛地自动摔上。 屋子里黑黝黝的，还有飕飕冷风流过，不像是置身一间酒肆，倒像是摸进了一个山洞。 沈清秋倒不意外，梦境不能以常理揣度，每一扇门后面，通往什么地方都是有可能。 这时，耳边浮起一阵怪异的响动。 那声音仿佛垂死之人，被扎穿了肺部，艰难无比地喘息不止，痛苦万状。 而且，似乎不止一个人！ 沈清秋打个响指，指尖飞弹出去一枚火光，射向异动传来的地方。 火光将那地方的景象映照得无一余漏，他瞳孔顿时收缩成微小的一点。 柳清歌正手持乘鸾剑，倒转剑柄，往自己胸口刺入。 他身上血迹斑斑，大片触目惊心的深红，伤口不止一处，嘴角血流如注，看来已经不知道 朝自己身上捅了多少剑，脸上表情却似怒似狂，总之就是极度亢奋的模样，明显已经神志 不清、走火入魔。 这画面在昏黄的焰光照耀之下，骇人至极，沈清秋一时间居然忘记了这还是在梦境之中， 扑上去就夺乘鸾剑。 那把剑已钉在柳清歌心脏正中，沈清秋只轻轻一碰，当场鲜血狂喷，险些没喷他一脸。满 眼见红，沈清秋稍稍清醒了些，后退两步，却又撞上一人。 他猛一回首，岳清源正低着头，与他对视。 虽然是与他对视，那双眼睛却空漠无光。从喉咙，到胸膛，四肢，腰腹 …… 密密麻麻刺满 了漆黑的箭矢。 万箭穿身。 沈清秋猛地明白这些是什么东西了  这是他们本来的死状！ 本来应该由他亲手促成的死状！ 沈清秋忍不下去了。他宁可在外面被一群无脸人围观，也不想看这种东西！ 他朝进来时的方向退去，居然真给他摸到了那扇木门，沈清秋如蒙大赦，一脚踹开门就往 外冲。这次心神不稳，自己乱了阵脚，跌跌撞撞的，居然有几分狼狈之态。街上所有 “ 人 ” 都死寂无声地注视着他，正分不清天南地北时，沈清秋一头撞入一人胸膛之中。 那人立即反手将他一搂，抱了个满怀。沈清秋一惊，立即抬头去看。 这人比他高一些，身长玉立，黑衣如墨，只露出白皙的颈部，再往上，就是一张罩住脸部 的狰狞鬼面。 沈清秋还没说话，便有带着沉沉笑意的声音从上方传来。 “ 师尊，小心啊。 ” 根本不用掀开面具，也能知道后面是谁的脸。 沈清秋猛地一挣。对方倒也没强硬地压制住他，挣脱倒也不难，一连退了数步，保持在安 全距离之外，沈清秋才定住身形。 他道： “ 这座城，都是你造的？ ” 洛冰河慢慢取下面具。 他脸上表情，似乎是在遗憾鬼捉人的游戏不能继续玩儿下去了，道： “ 不错。师尊以为如 何？ ” 沈清秋缓缓点头，面无表情道： “ 不愧是梦魔的亲传弟子。 ” 幻境能精细到这种程度，恐怕比起当日梦魔为困住他们造出来的那座城，也差不了多少。 而且，非常准确地把握住了他内心所恐惧的一些事物。 原本洛冰河心情好像还不错，听了这话，唇边笑意却淡去了，道： “ 我不是梦魔的弟子。 ” 沈清秋： “ 你不是拜他为师了？ ” 洛冰河憋了一会儿，用赌气一般的口气回道： “ 没有！ ” 好吧。没有就没有。沈清秋觉得这问题没必要多纠结。 洛冰河道： “ 师尊，如果你愿意自己回来，什么都好说。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 这算是 ‘ 从轻发落 ’ 的意思？ ” 洛冰河道： “ 只要我不化去你体内天魔之血，你逃到任何地方也是枉然。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 哦？是吗。 ” 他笑了笑： “ 那么现在，你为什么不亲自来抓我？ ” 洛冰河僵了僵，瞳中似有火花一闪而过。 沈清秋见他这幅模样，心里更有底了。 他慢悠悠地道： “ 你那把剑，出问题了吧？ ” 天助我也！ 洛冰河坠下无间深渊后，在远古巨兽腹中，寻到了魔族铸剑大师耗尽毕生心血锻造的一把 奇剑。 此剑名为心魔。 听名字就知道是非常危险的东西，对吧？！ 那是必须的！越是强大的灵器，越是难以驾驭。心魔剑从古至今，易手百余主人，无一不 是各族天纵奇才，饶是如此，最后也都逃不了死于自己剑下的宿命。 心魔剑，会反噬持有者。如能使之臣服，它就是你手中的利器；如有一天无法驾驭它的戾 气，你就是祭剑的血祭而已。 原著洛冰河是在进入魔界副本后，才出现第一次心神不宁、险些被反噬的情况，之后还因 为要解决这个问题，开启了长达 500 章的剧情支线，收了八个还是九个妹子。 可现在，随着剧情的错乱，反噬的情节也跟着提前了！ 心魔剑的反噬那不可不是好玩的，怪不得他没追来，忙着闭关补救，当然没办法亲自来捉 他了！ 谁让你缩短练级速度的！！！ 沈清秋心中正咆哮不止，突然，洛冰河抓住他的肩膀，用力一扯。 嗤啦。 怎么又来！！！ 又是裂衣！！！每次都撕衣服！！！你羞辱人的手段只有这一招吗？！真是太让人失望 了！！！ 洛冰河脸色都快黑成锅底了，一字一句，像是在嘴里咬碎了才吐出来： “ 就算我本人不能 来，师尊也别太高兴了。 ” 沈清秋这下更狼狈了，抓紧余下的布料，愠怒道： “ 你干什么？！ ” 那你也别撕我衣服 啊？！ 系统：【爽度 +50. 】 变态啊！为什么感觉这么变态！！！ 洛冰河手中一用力，白衣布料片片消解，随风而逝。他还不解恨，朝沈清秋压过去。 沈清秋一看他眼神，就觉得恐怕没完没了了。 怎么回事！感情洛冰河还是个撕衣狂魔？！ 他当然不能坐以待毙，可也没法真正地还击，只得徒带招式，不带灵力，象征性地抵挡一 下。十几招推送往来，迅捷无论。洛冰河明明可以稳占上风，却偏偏猫捉耗子一般，耐心 陪着他缠斗了一番。 沈清秋动作快是够快，可不知为什么，瞄准了的一掌打出去，就像打在棉花上。在洛冰河 眼里，仿佛总是慢了一拍，他总能不慌不忙以毫厘之差错开，再礼尚往来般的回击。再加 上系统烦死个人，每个来回之后，都要加个爽度， 20 、 30 、 50 不等，简直魔音贯脑。几个 来回后，轮到沈清秋脸黑了。 这哪是打架，连喂招都不算，简直是调戏！！！ 你朝哪儿打呢？！逗我呢吧？！打架不是应该以击倒对方为目标吗？！ 这么想着，沈清秋一不留神，用力过度，朝洛冰河那头栽倒。 洛冰河居然躲也不躲，任由沈清秋咚的一声，砸到他怀里。听声音带笑，似乎心情又愉悦 了起来： “ 这招可是师尊亲自教我的，力道须有收有放，最忌下盘不稳，为何自己反倒忘 了？ ” 这一刻，沈清秋脑子里疯狂地刷了满一屏 “ 小畜生 ” 。 妈蛋的这招他还真教过洛冰河！ 犹记当时，洛冰河刚从柴房搬出来不久。虽然仗着 * 炸天的资质，自己胡乱折腾也有一套 打架的方法，但除了入门弟子人人皆会的几下砍刺戳，再往上走的招式就狗屁不通了。 沈清秋看他练了一套剑法掌法步法，扶额良久。洛冰河惴惴不安在旁边等评价。 沈清秋不忍打击他，半天才挤出一句： “ 颇为变通灵活。 ” 为了把洛冰河这不忍直视的习惯掰正可谓是煞费苦心，天天给他做私人指导。也不知道怎 么回事，以洛冰河之聪颖和领悟力，应该一点就通，不用他说第二次，可实际上，他却表 现的非常顽固，谆谆教诲，转头就忘，总是用力过猛，往沈清秋怀里撞了不知道多少次， 撞到后来沈清秋也怒了。 你究竟是不是故意的啊？！他忍不住在洛冰河后脑上不轻不重拍了一巴掌，喝道： “ 你这 是御敌制敌吗？根本就是投怀送抱！ ” 满脸通红的洛冰河这才老老实实练起来，不敢随便失误了。 可是今天，却要被洛冰河反过来指导他姿势不对！ 这什么世道！ 沈清秋觉得自己为人师表的尊严受到了挑战，还未反击，洛冰河的手顺着他脊背线条一路 滑下。 沈清秋生生出了一背的鸡皮疙瘩。 他咬牙道： “ 洛冰河！ ” 脑内弹幕： “ 小畜生 x3 ！ ” 系统：【爽度 +100 ！恭喜！】 恭喜个头！ 洛冰河又拽下一段白衣残片，道： “ 我看见师尊身上穿着这件衣服，心中十分不快，还是 撕干净了好。 ” 这是不把他扒光不罢休的意思对吧？ 沈清秋道： “ 你要是讨厌我，倒也不用和这件衣服过不去，这是公仪萧的。 ” 洛冰河沉了脸色： “ 师尊才是真的讨厌我，一件衣服也非要和我划清界限。 ” 简直匪夷所思。 为什么！！！为什么两个大男人，一个是渣反一个是男主，要在这里被一群没脸的 “ 人 ” 围 观，一本正经地讨论一件衣服？！ 洛冰河你原来是感情细腻型的吗？！ 我都给你拍干净叠好了，你还想怎么样？总不能要求我手洗了亲自给你送回去吧？！ 沈清秋神色变幻莫测，洛冰河见状，道： “ 师尊在想什么？ ” 他凉凉地道： “ 如果是公仪萧，奉劝师尊，不必再想他了。 ” 沈清秋闻言，心中油然而生一股不祥之感。","CHAPTER 41: ESCAPING DEATH AT HUAYUE PART 2 His entire figure was soaked with the ghastly crimson color of blood. Innumerable injuries could be seen all over his body, and even more blood leaked from the corner of his mouth. He seemed to have forgotten how many swords had been directed towards him already. A deranged anger covered his face, and it was clear that he had long let go of sanity, devolving into qi deviation. This scene, under the brilliant, dizzying illumination of the fire, was terrifying beyond measure. For a moment, Shen Qingqiu forgot that he was within the Dream Realm, and threw himself towards Liu Qingge to pull out Cheng Luan. The sword had already pierced through Liu Qingge’s heart. Shen Qingqiu gently nudged it, only to be met with a spray of blood. Seeing this shocking sight, he slightly sobered up, retreating two steps back and bumping into another person. He jerked around violently. Yue Qingyuan faced him, his head lowered. Although they were facing each other, Yue Qingyuan’s eyes were empty of any light. From his neck to his chest, through all four limbs and his abdomen… he was punctured with black arrows. Ten-thousand arrows had pierced through his body. Shen Qingqiu suddenly realized what he was seeing in front of himthese were their original deaths! The deaths that the original Shen Qingqiu had caused with his own hands! Shen Qingqiu could not bear looking at the sight any longer. He would have rather been surrounded by a crowd of the faceless figures outside than to continue looking on at this kind of scene! He retreated towards the direction where he had first entered. Unexpectedly, he was still able to find the sliding wood door. Shen Qingqiu ran like a man who had just been granted amnesty, speeding away from the door as soon as he stepped foot outside. This time his mind was unstable, his thoughts a scrambled mess. As he staggered along the street, he couldn’t help but stumble over himself a few times, cutting a sorry figure. The “people” on the street stared at him. The surroundings were deathly silent.When he had been running for who knows how long, he suddenly ran head-on into the chest of a passerby. This person’s reaction was to immediately envelop him into an embrace filled with heavy emotions. The other person was taller than him by quite a bit, with a slim and lanky build. He was clothed entirely in black, except for a small exposed area around his neck. Above that, he was wearing a ferocious ghost mask. Shen Qingqiu hadn’t even been able to say anything before he heard an amused voice come from above: “Shizun, be careful.” He didn’t need to look under the mask to know who the person behind it was. Shen Qingqiu suddenly fought against the other’s embrace. The other person didn’t attempt to suppress him, and struggling free wasn’t hard. Only after he had retreated enough footsteps to guarantee his safety did he look at the figure. Shen Qingqiu asked, “Did you make this city?” Luo Binghe slowly removed his mask. The expression on his face almost looked like he regretted the “ghost-chasing-human” game didn’t last longer. “Not bad. What does Shizun think?” Shen Qingqiu slowly nodded his head. “You really are worthy of being called the Dream Demon’s prized disciple.” To be able to craft an illusion at such a meticulous level was an impressive task. Compared to the one that the Dream Demon had trapped them in so long ago, this one wasn’t lacking. Furthermore, this illusion had managed to accurately grasp on to his greatest fear. Originally, Luo Binghe’s mood had been somewhat good. Hearing this statement, however, his smile vanished. “I’m not the Dream Demon’s disciple.” Shen Qingqiu found this somewhat strange. “Didn’t you pay your respects to him as your teacher?” Luo Binghe choked, then indignantly replied, “No!” Alright. No meant no. Shen Qingqiu didn’t feel like lingering on this question. Luo Binghe said, “Shizun, if you’re willing to come back on your own, you can negotiate any terms.” Shen Qingqiu replied, “Can this be considered ‘lenient sentencing’?”Luo Binghe said, “As long as I don’t remove my blood from your body, any attempts to flee are futile.” Shen Qingqiu said, “Oh. Is that it?” He laughed. “Then, right now, why aren’t you trying to grab me?” Luo Binghe stiffened, a flash of light flickering in his pupils. Seeing this expression, Shen Qingqiu’s heart suddenly sunk. Slowly, he asked, “That sword of yours, is something wrong with it?” Heavens help me, ah! When Luo Binghe had fallen into the Endless Abyss, he had found, inside the corpse of an ancient creature, a strange sword that a master Devil master forged using his own heart blood. This sword was known as Heart Devil. Hearing this name was enough for one to know that this was a dangerous item, right? That was, of course, a must! The more powerful a spirit weapon was, the more difficult it was to control. From the eons of time between the ancient era and now, the Heart Devil sword had gone through hundreds of owners. All of them were formidable geniuses within their sectsyet, despite this, there wasn’t a single one that was able to escape the fate of dying by their own sword. The Heart Devil sword fought against all that wielded it. If one could force the spirit to acknowledge you, it would serve as a formidable weapon; yet, if there was a day in the future where one was unable to suppress the sword’s evil nature, then they were nothing more than a sacrificial sheep being led to the slaughter. The original Luo Binghe had first suffered the side effects only after entering the Demonic Secret Realm and narrowly escaped being devoured by the sword. In order to resolve this problem, a 500 chapter side plot had occurred, where Luo Binghe had then collected eight or nine more little sisters. But now, the entire plot of the story was in shambles. The plot event of the sword’s counterattack was now occurring too far ahead of schedule! The Heart Devil sword’s counterattack was not at all easy to deal with. It was no wonder that Luo Binghe had been unable to chase him. Being so preoccupied with finding the remedy, of course, he could not catch Shen Qingqiu himself! Suddenly, Luo Binghe grabbed one of his shoulders, forcefully pulling at his robe. Oh.Why was he back? Luo Binghe’s expression looked as dark as the burnt base of a pot. Slowly, one word at a time, he spat out, “Even if I can’t personally come right now, Shizun shouldn’t celebrate too much.” Still, don’t rip my clothes! Shen Qingqiu grabbed at the remaining cloth, angrily shouting, “What are you doing? Is this the only way you know how to humiliate someone?” Luo Binghe replied, “It was clearly Shizun that first humiliated me!” System: Coolness +50. This could also add points? It was too abnormal! Why did he feel like this was too abnormal? Luo Binghe’s hand exerted force, instantly crushing the white fabric into small pieces that disappeared with the wind. He moved forward, his expression not quite hateful yet, and pressed towards Shen Qingqiu’s direction. Seeing Luo Binghe’s eyes, Shen Qingqiu felt at once a violent dread form inside him. Although he had never known that Luo Binghe possessed a tendency to rip up clothes, he wasn’t about to sit around and wait for death. He aimed a dozen attacks towards Luo Binghe, then quickly tried to make his escape. Luo Binghe was clearly capable of gaining the upper hand, and yet preferred to play cat-and-mouse, patiently playing around with him. Shen Qingqiu’s speed was extremely fast, but in Luo Binghe’s eyes, he was always a beat slower than him. Whenever Shen Qingqiu attempted to strike him, he was able to step aside calmly, then symbolically return an attack. Combined with the annoying people commenting on the System, and with the protagonist’s coolness constantly going up 20, 30, 50 times incessantly, it really was enough to drive someone crazy! After a back and forth, Shen Qingqiu’s face blackened. Where are you trying to hit? Are you playing around with me? Isn’t the objective of a fight to knock the opponent down? How was this a fight! This couldn’t even be considered exchanging pointersit was practically assault! When he thought of this, Shen Qingqiu became distracted and accidentally went too fast, crashing towards Luo Binghe. Luo Binghe unexpectedly did not even cower, allowing Shen Qingqiu to crash into his embrace. His voice spoke, amused and cheerful: “This maneuver Shizun used was something that he personally taught me. Of course, using it has its pros and cons, the greatest disadvantage being that the lower body becomesunstable. How has Shizun forgotten it?” At this moment, Shen Qingqiu’s mind became filled with a colorful array of “you little fucker” emotes. Fuck! This maneuver really was something that he had taught to Luo Binghe! His memory went back to the time when Luo Binghe had just moved out of the firewood room. At that time, with his extraordinary Heaven-gifted talent, Luo Binghe had managed to tentatively develop his own style of fighting. However, other than the few moves that all the disciples were taught, everything else he had learned was worth dog shit. Shen Qingqiu, seeing him practice a set of sword, foot, and palm exercises, couldn’t help but facepalm. Luo Binghe, at the side, waited for his verdict. At a time like this, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t bear to strike him down. After a while, he finally squeezed out a line: “It’s very flexible.” In order to correct Luo Binghe’s painful-to-look-at form, Shen Qingqiu painstakingly went to great lengths to give him daily personal training. However, for whatever reason, this smart and perceptive child performed extremely poorly. Luo Binghe, who should have been able to pick up on lessons easily without being instructed twice, in reality forgot what he was taught almost immediately. He would frequently use too much force, crashing into Shen Qingqiu’s arms for who knows how many times, until eventually Shen Qingqiu reached his breaking point. Are you doing this on purpose? He couldn’t help but firmly slap Luo Binghe’s forehead, yelling, “Is this how you fight your opponents? You’re practically throwing yourself into their laps!” After this, the red-faced Luo Binghe finally began to learn properly, not daring to make any more mistakes. However, today, Shen Qingqiu had unexpectedly been lectured by Luo Binghe on his incorrect posture. What kind of world was this! Shen Qingqiu felt like his pride as a teacher had suffered a great blow. While he was distracted, Luo Binghe’s hands began to trail down his back, causing a line of goosebumps to form on Shen Qingqiu’s skin. Shen Qingqiu gritted his teeth. “Luo Binghe!” System: Coolness +100! Congratulations!Congratulations my ass! Luo Binghe tore off another fragment of the white robe, remarking, “When I see Shizun wear this robe, my heart becomes ten times unhappier. It’s better to take it all off.” Was he implying that he wouldn’t be happy until Shen Qingqiu was naked? Shen Qingqiu said, “If you hate me, don’t take it out on the robe. It belongs to Gongyi Xiao!” Luo Binghe’s expression deepened. “Shizun is the one who hates me. You even rejected a robe because I wore it.” Why? Why were two grown men debating a robe in the midst of a faceless audience? Luo Binghe, were you really the type to have such delicate feelings? I even brushed it clean and folded it for you, what else do you want? Did you really expect me to hand-wash it and then personally return it to you? Shen Qingqiu’s expression changed erratically. Seeing this, Luo Binghe inquired, “Shizun, what are you thinking?” Coldly, he added, “If it’s Gongyi Xiao, I advise Shizun to stop thinking about him.” Shen Qingqiu’s heart became filled with an ominous premonition. Heavily, he asked, “What is it about Gongyi Xiao?” According to the original plotline, Gongyi Xiao’s banishment into the prospectless border as a patrol guard followed after Luo Binghe and the Young Palace Mistress tumbled together in bed. But now that the plot had devolved into a mess that not even Airplane Shooting Towards The Sky could recognize it, anything could happen. But before Luo Binghe could answer, the faceless people around Shen Qingqiu suddenly began to move. Before, they had either stared blankly like mentally handicapped people or busied themselves with whatever they were doing. Now, however, they began to condense towards Shen Qingqiu, forcing him into the middle. Unable to force them apart, he sent a look at Luo Binghe. Luo Binghe’s eyebrows were tightly knitted together, with one hand was pressed against his forehead. He seemed to be preoccupied with something, as if he was resisting some kind of force invading his head. Shen Qingqiu was suddenly brought back to his senses. This reaction must have been caused by the Heart Devil sword counterattacking and invading Luo Binghe’s mind. Unable to produce enough energy to maintain the illusion, thedreamscape was starting to collapse. If he didn’t leave now, then when? Since Luo Binghe was currently unable to distract or hinder him, then, according to his experience, he should be able to destroy this weakening dreamscape as long as he could overcome his heart’s greatest fear. Shen Qingqiu, having decided to leave, left. Luo Binghe’s splitting headache prevented him from moving. He could only helplessly yell, “If you dare to take even one more step, see what happens!” Shen Qingqiu immediately walked ten or so steps. Afterwards, he turned around, asking, “What?” Seeing this, Luo Binghe was angered to the point of spitting up blood. Word by word, he spat out, “Wait and see!” Shen Qingqiu didn’t turn around. Coldly and loftily, he replied, “Goodbye!” Do you think if you tell me to wait I’ll wait? I’m not an idiot! Shen Qingqiu looked around at one of the nearby shops. Kicking the door open, he entered the store. No matter what was waiting for him inside, Shen Qingqiu had resolved to confront it with absolute calmness. At the very least, his chances were higher here than facing off against Luo Binghe! As soon as the door closed, the clamorous sounds from outside were cut as if by a sharp knife, enveloping the room in a deathly stillness. Shen Qingqiu held his breath, silently waiting. After a while, as if someone had lit a candle, the surroundings gradually lit up. Shen Qingqiu lowered his head, just in time to lock eyes with a foreign, yet familiar face. A thin boy knelt in front of him. He was clothed in a coarse cloth garment. In his kneeling position, he gave off the impression of a crestfallen figure. Behind him, his hands were tightly tied together with rope. Although his face was deathly pale, however, his two pupils were filled with life. Shen Qingqiu was unable to tear his eyes off of him. This scene was absolutely not in his memory. However, this face really did resemble him. Only the polish of time and cultivation were missing, and there was a youth to the boy’s face that was no longer present now. This was Shen Qingqiu, and yet it wasn’t Shen Qingqiu.What must be made certain wasthis was Shen Jiu! Shen Qingqiu suddenly sat up from the floorboards. After waking up, he looked around, realizing that he was lying inside an abandoned building. The sky was bright, daylight spilling in from the shabby window frames and the small cracks in the rice-paper walls. The memories came flooding back. Yesterday, during the festival, he had randomly wandered around until he found an abandoned building. His original plan had only been to rest for a while; however, Luo Binghe dragged him into the Dream Realm once he was asleep. Thinking back to the dreamscape before its collapse, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but become pensive. Although the original goods and him were two completely different people, they shared one flesh body. Inevitably, he would suffer some influence. What he saw yesterday should have been the original Shen Jiu’s childhood memories. This could be considered as cheating. The current Shen Qingqiu suffered no trauma from watching these memories, so naturally the illusion had been easy to dissipate. However, in retrospect, Shen Qingqiu felt doubt creeping his mind. In the dream, Shen Jiu had been tied up. He had originally thought that this time period was when Shen Jiu was still in the hands of the slave traffickers, yet the room had a soft carpet, all sorts of valuables, and calligraphy scrolls and paintings hanging from the walls. This noble room, instead of a traffickers’ hideout, was more like a rich man’s study… It seemed like in the Qiu family, Shen Jiu had not received the love and affection that Qiu Haitang claimed he had."
"沈清秋沉声道： “…… 公仪萧怎么了？ ” 照理说 , 公仪萧被流放到没有前途可言的荒境去守边界，应该是在洛冰河和小宫主滚床单 之后的事情。 不过现在剧情已经乱得连向天打飞机这亲爹都不认识了 , 自然什么都有可能提前。 可还没等到洛冰河的回答 , 沈清秋身边的无脸人们开始躁动起来。 他们原本只是呆呆愣愣，智障一样木然围观 , 或者自己做着手头的事，现在却开始以他为 中心，慢慢聚拢。 沈清秋被挤在中间 , 又不能把他们直接轰开。再看洛冰河，他却也是眉头紧蹙 , 一只手挡在 额前，无暇注意其他的事 , 似乎正忍受着什么东西对大脑的侵袭。 沈清秋登时回过味来。 暴走！ 多半心魔剑趁机反噬 , 在试图扰乱洛冰河神智。他腾不出更多的精力来维持结界，梦境开 始暴走了。 此时不走，更待何时！ 现在洛冰河不能分心给他设绊，那么只要再经历一场幻境，并且克服心中潜藏的恐惧，就 能把这个开始溃散的结界打破！ 沈清秋说走就走，洛冰河看上去头痛欲裂，又没办法动弹，喝道： “ 你敢走一步试试？！ ” 沈清秋一连走了十几步。 走完之后，回头，悠悠道： “ 如何？ ” 洛冰河看上去就快吐血了。 他一字一字从齿间迸出： “…… 你等着！ ” 沈清秋目不斜视，高贵冷艳地道： “ 再见！ ” 你让我等我就等？ 又不是傻逼！ 沈清秋瞅准一旁另一间铺子，一脚踹开大门，就跃了进去。 无论这一次，出来的会是什么东西，沈清秋都绝对有把握能镇定面对。 起码比面对洛冰河有把握得多！ 身后门一关上，外界一切嘈杂喧闹都仿佛被一柄利刃斩断，霎时死寂无声。 沈清秋屏气凝神，静静等待。 良久，仿佛谁点亮了一支蜡烛，视野颤颤巍巍亮了起来。沈清秋一低头，和一张陌生又似 熟悉的脸孔正正四目相对。 他面前跪着一名身形单薄的少年。 脸色惨白，下颔秀巧，身穿粗布衣衫，弯腰跪着，是一个垂头丧气的姿势，并且，双手被 粗麻绳紧紧绑住。 这少年目光几近呆滞，一动不动，和沈清秋对视，瞳孔中倒映出一个黑色的人影。 沈清秋与他目不转睛对视。 这绝对不是他的记忆。 可这张脸，又的的确确和他一模一样。只不过，少了时光和修为打磨出来的气韵，多了少 年人的青涩。 这是沈清秋，可又不是沈清秋。 一定要说清楚的话  这是沈九！ 沈清秋猛地从木板上坐起。 惊醒之后，他四下望望，才发现自己躺在一间废宅内。 天色已明，白光从破旧的窗框和糊纸缝隙间洒入。 对，昨晚他在祭典上乱走一通，没多久就真的找了一间没人的老房子。本意只是休息一下 ，却不想一不留神睡着，就给洛冰河在梦境里逮住了。 如果不是心魔剑捣乱，还不知道要被洛冰河玩儿到什么时候。 忆起梦境崩塌前，那个被沈清秋自己打碎的幻境，他不由沉思起来。 虽然原装货和他是不同的两个人，可现在毕竟用的是人家的肉身，多少也会受点影响。 昨晚他看到的，应该是 “ 沈清秋 ” 还是 “ 沈九 ” 时，在人贩子手里的记忆。 这可算是作弊了。因为现在的沈清秋自己，对这段记忆根本没什么阴影，当然不花力气就 能轻松破出。 只是有一件事，他颇为在意。 当时，沈九的瞳孔里倒映出了一个人影。不过，这个人影，并不是沈清秋。 也就是说，沈清秋看到的幻境并不完全。 这场记忆里，应该有两个人。除了沈九以外，还有一个 “ 人 ” ，也在现场。沈九眼中倒映出 来的，就是他的影子。 只可惜，沈清秋刚想仔细看看那个人影的相貌，结界就被破除，他便醒了过来。 沈清秋从光秃秃的木塌上跳下来，下意识摸摸身上，衣服总算都还在。 不过，虽然衣物完好无损，他却绝对不想再穿了！ 穿在身上就有一种随时会被撕掉的威胁感啊！ 沈清秋决定 “ 借 ” 点别人的衣服来穿。谁知，他刚 “ 借 ” 完，翻出墙檐，立定在地，一回头， 就见几个人大眼瞪小眼瞪着他。 …… 真是冤家路窄，昨天昨夜祭奠遇到的那几个杂派弟子啊！ 他还一个字都没说，对方为首的男子立刻亮兵器，汹汹喝道： “ 沈清秋，你果然在这城 里！今天，就让我霸气宗弟子们替天行道！ ” 标准台词有木有！ 顺便霸气宗是个什么玩意儿，从来没听过！ 而且什么替天行道，昨天不是说好了为的是幻花宫的悬赏吗？当面一套背后一套有意思 吗？！ 沈清秋懒得跟他们纠缠。啪啪啪几道新鲜出炉的符咒甩出去，当场一人额头贴了一道，肢 体僵直，连格挡的机会都没有。 沈清秋心情正糟糕，贴完了之后，慢悠悠做了个 “ 撕 ” 的动作。 下一刻，那几名弟子就发现，身体不听使唤自己动了起来。 “ 你撕我衣服干什么？！ ” “ 你不也在撕我的吗？！ ” “ 师兄对不起！可我控制不了我的手啊！ ” 沈清秋拍了拍新换的一身朴素白衣，头也不回往前走。 就是要和衣服过不去！ 在城里没走几步，沈清秋就发现，果然受通缉令涌入花月城的人数不少。 即便许多修士都装模作样地不穿本派统一服色，扮作常人，可往路边摊一坐，光是架势就 迥异于常人。看来拜托公仪萧通知柳清歌前来是极为正确的举动。即便洛冰河没法亲自来 ，这些各门各派龙蛇混杂的修士如果缠上来妨碍他，也够烦人了。 沈清秋觉得，这样下去不行，干脆找个角落，把脸涂黄，再胡乱贴了几把胡子。 修雅剑 …… 就委屈下裹衣服里面吧，挫是挫了点，总比被人指着大喊 “ 啊！快看！是修雅 剑！ ” 要好。 一切准备妥当，这才慢吞吞回到街上。 沈清秋抬头看天，云色薄软，似在渐渐散去。 如无意外，今日正午，应当就是最佳时机。 他再一低头，前方人群中，有个雪白修长的身影一闪而过，既快且轻，侧颜俊逸。 柳清歌！ 保镖来了！沈清秋眼睛一亮，刚要追上去，突然，从一旁酒肆之中传出一声娇叱。 “ 嘴里不干不净说什么呢？！ ” 紧接着，就是一阵砰楞啷的打砸巨响。 这声音娇嫩清脆，十分熟悉，沈清秋一愣，不由自主停下脚步，目光被吸引过去。 这时，另一个少女哼了一声，道： “ 怎么，敢做还不许人说了？也难怪，苍穹山派出了这 种败类，自然是羞于启齿。 ” 先前说话那少女立即反驳道： “ 师尊绝对不是会做这种事的人，你休要污蔑！ ” 现在还能这样为他说话的少女，除了宁婴婴还有谁呢。 虽然沈清秋有心要去寻柳清歌，但看这边气氛不对，纠结一秒，还是怕清静峰弟子吃亏， 暂且留下来，闪身潜在一旁，观望一番。 酒肆一楼之中，明显分成了两派阵营。 一边是以明帆和宁婴婴为首，清静峰弟子在后，个个面色不善。另一边则是小宫主叉腰在 前，横眉冷对，身后幻花宫弟子早已亮了兵器，目光更为怨愤。 两名少女，一个相貌秀致，一个容色殊丽，婷婷而对，纵然空气中尽是噼里啪啦滋滋燃烧 的火药味，画面却也无比养眼。 洛冰河又后院起火啦！  不对，连清静峰弟子都来了！而且跟幻花宫撞上了，这才叫真 正的冤家路窄！ 沈清秋断定，他要是现在撒手走了，绝对是清静峰吃大亏。要知道，这小宫主可是飞扬跋 扈到天下除了洛冰河就没有她不敢打的人。打伤打残，那可是她的娱乐活动！ 小宫主哼道： “ 不是那样的人？那他为什么畏罪潜逃？而且还 …… 还 ……” 说着恨恨咬牙。 宁婴婴反唇相讥： “ 师尊这么做，自然是有他自己的原因，本来就没定罪，算什么畏罪潜 逃了？再说，原本就要怪你们幻花宫轻信，非要关师尊入水牢，才会闹到今日这种地 步！ ” 撕【哔  】的原因居然不是男主而是他！？虽然很感动，但沈清秋何德何能！ 可同时，他心中那种不详的预感也更浓重了。 幻花宫恐怕是又出什么事了。而且看这架势，新帐旧账，一把连都算到他头上了。 膝盖已经千疮百孔了 [ 手动拜拜 ] 小宫主勃然大怒（其实沈清秋觉得她无时不刻都在勃然大怒）： “ 照你这么说，我们幻花 宫是咎由自取了？！岂有此理！ ” 明帆冷笑： “ 你们幻花宫的人眼睛瞎耳朵聋，胡搅蛮缠的本事倒是一流。 ” 沈清秋震惊了：清静峰一脉弟子以往在他面前都唯唯诺诺一个样，屁都不敢放一个，让喂 鸡不敢遛狗，原来在外面这张嘴还挺能打的？ 小宫主气得脸色发白，突然回首，一道黑影仿佛一条毒蛇，从袖中游出。 我擦换了条新鞭子！ 眼看着终于开打了，原本坐在酒肆一搂的客人们都迅速无比地撤了出来，从沈清秋身边经 过时居然都一脸见怪不怪的淡定，看来花月城人民早就见惯这种场景了，小二甚至出来前 还娴熟无比地在柱子上贴了张账单。 小宫主毕竟是老宫主爱女，手把手教出来的功夫，鞭风凌厉，宁婴婴一把剑左支右咄，隐 隐有点招架不住，明帆想帮忙，却怎么也插不进圈子里去，只能干着急。沈清秋见状，顺 手在脚边花樽中摘了一枚青叶，飞了出去。 那枚柔软的青叶满满灌注了一股灵力，和精铁鞭相撞，居然发出刺耳的金石之声。小宫主 根本没看清，只觉得虎口被震得发麻，鞭子脱手，飞了出去。宁婴婴也跟着一愣。 小宫主没了兵器，可反应极快，手上劲势一转，化作一耳光打了过去。 啪的一声，宁婴婴捂着脸偏到一边。 你妹！！！！！ 看着宁婴婴面颊上五个手指印，脸颊都肿了半边，沈清秋心疼死了。 我都没打过的徒弟，你也敢打？！？！ 明帆拔剑吼道： “ 欺人太甚！咱们跟他们拼了！ ” 清静峰弟子早就忍不住了，小师妹被打了，能忍？！这时齐齐大喝出声，长剑出鞘，剑光 雪亮。 这下沈清秋头都大了。正纠结要不要继续搅合下去，忽然，注意到幻花宫弟子群中，有一 人情形，十分不对劲。 沈清秋盯着那人观察两秒，心中咯噔一声，暗叫不妙。 这下恐怕没办法走了。","CHAPTER 42: QUARREL AT THE WINE SHOP Shen Qingqiu jumped from the bare wooden floor and, under the influence of his subconscious mind, patted his body. His clothes were still all there. However, even though his clothes were actually intact, he didn’t want to wear them any longer since he now felt as though they could be torn off at any time! Shen Qingqiu decided to “borrow” someone else’s clothes to wear. Who would have thought that just as he finished “borrowing” and jumped down from the eaves, he would find several people staring at him wide-eyed when he turned around? The enemies he met on this narrow road 148 were actually the same disciples he had seen last night when the festival was in full swing. He did not say a word. The man who was the leader of the other group immediately drew his weapon and shouted in a frenzy: “Shen Qingqiu, you really were in this city! Today, my sect’s iron-fisted 149 disciples will enforce justice on behalf of heaven!” It really was the standard script but why was there now a part about “enforcing justice on behalf of heaven?” Yesterday, weren’t they talking about the reward from Huan Hua Palace? Was it fun to say one thing behind a person’s back and another when they were face-to-face with each other? By the way, what is this “iron-fisted” thing about? I’ve never heard of it! Shen Qingqiu was too lazy to bother with them. He flung a few freshly made talismans that pasted themselves onto the cultivators’ foreheads. Their limbs went stiff and none of them had the chance to block the talismans. Shen Qingqiu was in a bad mood. After he finished sticking the talismans on those people, he slowly made a gesture as though he was tearing something. The next moment, the disciples discovered that they had no control over their bodies and were moving by themselves. “What are you doing? Why are you tearing up my clothes?” “Aren’t you tearing my clothes off, too?” “Senior apprentice brother! Sorry! But I can’t control my hands!” Shen Qingqiu changed into new, plain, and simple white clothes and didn’t look back as he walked away. After walking a few steps, Sheng Qingqiu saw that there were many people who had come to Huayue City, drawn by the search for the wanted man. Even if a lot of the cultivators took off their uniforms and wore regularclothes, pretending to be ordinary people sitting at the roadside stalls, their manner was just too different from ordinary people. Shen Qingqiu felt that it would be impossible to go on like this. He smeared some yellow makeup on his face and carelessly pasted on a beard 150 . When everything was ready, he slowly walked back to the street. Looking up at the sky, he saw that the clouds were thin and wispy. They seemed like they were gradually dispersing. If no unexpected mishap occurred, noon today would be the best time. When Shen Qingqiu lowered his head, he saw a snow-white, slender figure flash past, his movements both fast and light. His face was extremely handsome. Liu Qingge! The hatchet man has arrived! Shen Qingqiu’s eyes lit up. He was just about to catch up with that figure when, suddenly, he heard a lovely voice scolding someone from inside a wine shop: “What did you say with that filthy mouth of yours?” The voice was delicate and melodious. It sounded very familiar so Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but stop. His eyes were drawn towards the source. Suddenly, there came the sound of things crashing and the passers-by started watching the commotion. At this time, another girl snorted and said: “Hmph, why shouldn’t people say it? No wonder this piece of scum, Sheng Qingqiu, came out of Cang Qiong Mountain sect! All of you, especially the people from Qing Jing Peak, are naturally anxious to cover up your shame! Ha! Unfortunately, the whole world already knows what kind of person he is. You think you can cover it up?” Her voice was full of resentment. The girl who had spoken earlier immediately retorted, “Shizun is absolutely not the type of person who would do such a thing. Don’t you dare slander him!” Who else would speak so well of him now if not Ning Yingying? Ming Fan’s voice was also heard: “We’re only being polite to you to give the Old Palace Master some face, so watch your mouth and speak politely, too!” Although the most important thing for Shen Qingqiu right now was to find Liu Qingge, looking at the atmosphere here, things were not right. He paused for a while, afraid that the Qing Jing Peak disciples might suffer losses. He decided to stay for the time being in case things went sideways. It was better to wait and see. The first floor of the wine shop was clearly divided into two factions.On one side were the two leaders, Ming Fan and Ning Yingying, while behind them was a group of Qing Jing Peak disciples. Each and every one of them had an angry expression on their faces. On the other side was the Young Palace Mistress, standing in front of the others with her hands on her hips. The Huan Hua Palace disciples behind her had already drawn their weapons and the expressions on their faces were more resentful. Two young girls, both with refined, delicate figures and each with a different type of beauty. Both stood gracefully, convinced of their own righteousness. Even though the air was full of crackling and burning sparks, this scene was also very eye-catching. Luo Binghe, once again there’s a fire in your backyard 151  no, the Qing Jing Peak disciples had come to this place and they clashed with the people from Huan Hua Palace. This situation truly embodied the saying “enemies meet on a narrow road 152 .” Shen Qingqiu ventured to imagine that if he were to leave now, Qing Jing Peak would definitely suffer a big loss. You know, this Young Palace Mistress is so arrogant that there is no one that she dared not fight, except for Luo Binghe! Brutally beating people up was nothing out of the ordinary for her 153 ! The Young Palace Mistress snorted. “Not that type of person? Then tell me! Why did he flee to escape his punishment? And he also… also … also did that sort of thing!” Her voice was heavy with hate as she gritted her teeth and her eyes grew red. Ning Yingying retorted: “Shizun hasn’t been convicted. What do you mean by ‘fleeing to escape punishment’? It’s not yet clear who did it. We Cang Qiong Mountain sect haven’t blamed you Huan Hua Palace people for being overly credulous and suspicious. You insisted on locking up the Lord of Qing Jing Peak in your water prison. If that hadn’t occurred then things wouldn’t have gone this far!” The reason for all the fucking problems was actually not the protagonist but him? Sheng Qingqiu’s hands started sweating and a certain Shen’s heart was humbled. At the same time, the dark clouds in his heart also became even thicker. Looking at these people’s attitude, something must have happened at Huan Hua Palace after he left. Now the new grudge was added to all of the old grudges, and all of it was on his head. The Young Place Mistress was furious  indeed, Shen Qingqiu thoughtthat her default state was one of great fury: “So you’re saying that Huan Hua Palace is to blame for courting disaster? Well, well! Cang Qiong Mountain sect is really amazing at throwing its weight around arrogantly. Instead of apologizing, you act wildly in front of the victim’s family! With this type of moral integrity, unexpectedly you still dare to boast of being the number one cultivation sect in the world! How absurd!” Ning Yingying’s mouth twitched and she said: “Cang Qiong Mountain sect is widely recognized as the number one sect in the world. You admitted it yourself. But whether you admit it or not doesn’t matter. Besides, who is the one who acted wildly first? We disciples of Qing Jing Peak were having a meal in this shop. You’re inverting logic and reason since you were the ones who started shouting abuse at us as soon as you entered, saying that our entire Cang Qiong Mountain sect should be buried along with the dead-who the hell can say something that outrageous? Huayue City isn’t your Huan Hua Palace’s backyard! Or do you think that the whole world is your territory?” Shen Qingqiu was stunned to hear her speech, which was said in a lovely and clear voice. How could the words of the innocent, unaffected, silly Yingying unexpectedly be so cutting? Why was the Young Palace Mistress acting like a rabid dog just let out of its cage, ready to bite? Ning Yingying added: “My Qing Jing Peak has always been known for its courtesy and Shizun has taught us well. One shouldn’t argue with children with dirty mouths. That’s why we have tolerated your behavior until now. Have you finished cursing? If you’re done, then leave! Don’t interfere with our mealtime. I don’t feel like eating anymore after I’ve seen you.” Then she picked up a cup of tea from the table and poured it on the other person’s feet. The Young Palace Mistress dodged but a few drops of tea splashed onto the edge of her skirt. She said, “You, you bitch!” This time, Ming Fan quit eating. Throwing down his chopsticks, he laughed grimly and said: “Don’t think that just because you’re the Old Palace Master’s daughter that we’re afraid of you. Anyway, you’re nothing but a spoiled daddy’s girl and you’re not even of the same generation. Bitch? I don’t think anyone here is more of a bitch than you. Huan Hua Palace is losing face because of you!” Shen Qingqiu was shocked. In the past, Qing Jing Peak’s disciples were always obedient and submissive in front of him. They didn’t even dare to fart. When he told them to feed the chickens, they dared not walk the dog. When he told them to cook forhim, they dared not boil porridge. But it turns out, they liked to run their mouths off when they went to play outside. The Young Palace Mistress’s face turned pale with anger. In addition, she had heard from Qin Wanyue that this soft-looking little witch in front of her had been fellow disciples with Luo Binghe for many years. The two of them were childhood playmates who became childhood sweethearts! Envy and hatred mingled together and the Young Palace Mistress suddenly raised her hand. A dark shadow like a poisonous snake slithered out of her sleeve. Fuck! It was a new whip! Seeing that a fight was finally about to start, the customers who had been sitting inside the wine shop were quickly and efficiently hustled out. As they passed by Shen Qingqiu, he noticed that they all looked strangely calm. It seems as though the people of Huayue City were used to this sort of thing. In fact, with incomparable skill, the waiter even managed to finish totaling up everyone’s bill. The Young Palace Mistress, as the Old Palace Master’s beloved daughter, had received a lot of hands-on martial arts training. Her weapon was also extraordinary so the whip’s strikes were very fierce. As for Ning Yingying, she was the little junior apprentice sister that everyone at Qing Jing Peak doted on. She rarely encountered dangerous situations and had almost no actual combat experience. Her sword swung left and right but it was evident that soon she wouldn’t be able to fend off the strikes. Ming Fan wanted to help but how could he enter the circle of the high-grade iron whip’s dance? He could only watch the fight anxiously. When Shen Qingqiu saw how things were going, he picked up a green leaf from the flower bed at his feet and flung it out. The soft green leaf, filled with spiritual power, collided with the high- grade iron whip. Unexpectedly, they all heard the ear-piercing sound of two hard objects striking each other. The Young Palace Mistress hadn’t noticed anything strange but she felt the place between her thumb and forefinger had become numb. Her grip on the whip loosened and it flew off. Ning Yingying was also confused. She was just about to swing her sword when she saw that the Young Palace Mistress no longer had a weapon to block her strike. Fearful that she might stab the Young Palace Mistress with her sword, Ning Yingying quickly withdrew her sword. The Young Palace Mistress, however, was very quick to react. After her weapon flew out of her grasp, she used the momentum of her arm to slap Ning Yingying. With the loud sound of a hand hitting flesh, one side of Ning Yingying’s face was slapped.Damn! Looking at the five fingerprints on Ning Yingying’s face and how half of her face was swollen, one could clearly see how vicious her opponent’s hand had been. Shen Qingqiu’s heart was in pain. I’ve never struck my disciple but you dare to beat her up? Ning Yingying’s beautiful face was now asymmetrical  flat on one side and swollen on the other side. It looked quite ugly. The Young Palace Mistress’s attitude was full of malicious pride as she rubbed her wrist, raised her chin, and laughed: “Since your Shizun hasn’t taught you, then this Palace Master will teach you. The first thing you need to learn is that when people talk, they should observe proper behavior and speech.” Who the fuck do you think you are to lecture my disciples in my place? Ming Fan drew his sword and shouted, “Bitch! That’s going too far! Let’s fight them!” The other Qing Jing disciples had long been unable to endure the insults. Now that their little junior apprentice sister was beaten up, how could they bear it any longer? The others shouted and unsheathed their swords. Their weapons were dazzlingly bright. Shen Qingqiu thoughts raced as he tried to think of a way to take care of the Young Palace Mistress without causing bloodshed or revealing his whereabouts. Suddenly, he noticed that one of Huan Hua Palace’s disciples was behaving strangely. His appearance was one hundred percent fishy. Shen Qingqiu stared at the man for just two seconds before his heart started beating wildly, crying out that something was very wrong. I’m afraid it won’t be easy to get out of here. At first glance, the disciple actually looked very ordinary. He was in the midst of a group of Huan Hua Palace disciples but he was cowering and refusing to meet anyone’s eyes. Shen Qingqiu noticed him because his face was one color, his neck was another color, and his left and right hands were also two different colors. In addition, in the midst of a situation where everyone was lively, he didn’t draw his sword, shout, or look at anyone angrily. He just kept his head lowered among the crowd of Huan Hua Palace disciples as though he was a pickpocket waiting for an opportunity. As far as Shen Qingqiu knew, there was only one kind of person who would behave like this. Ming Fan was busily fighting people when he turned back and shouted:“Little junior apprentice sister! How are you doing?” Ning Yingying was in a daze for some time, as though she had been beaten silly before she came to her senses. Her face turned red then white, both angry and tearful, as she fought using her sword. She had suffered an insult when she was being too softhearted. This time, she didn’t show any mercy. Outside, among the crowd of onlookers, Shen Qingqiu saw an old cat with its tail curled up in the air, lazily licking his fur and basking in the sun. He picked it up and threw it inside the wine shop. The old cat was frightened and yowled loudly as it fled between two groups of people. Shen Qingqiu kept his head low as he followed in its wake, sneaking into the field of battle. When a person inexplicably entered the room, both sides were startled. Ning Yingying was afraid of injuring an innocent person and was slightly hesitant to continue. On the other hand, the Young Palace Mistress didn’t hesitate at all. She retrieved her whip and started fighting. Shen Qingqiu chased the old cat around, shouting out a name that he had just given it. Ning Yingying didn’t dare to make a move in the midst of this chaos. Strangely, she felt as though her elbow was being supported by something and her shoulders were being pushed. Her sword was moving with almost no input from her as it danced and flashed with a silvery light. Suddenly, there was the loud sound a hand hitting flesh twice. The Young Palace Mistress covered her face, struck dumb and frozen in place. These two sounds were louder and clearer than when she had slapped Ning Yingying earlier. Just now everyone in both groups saw how Ning Yingying moved her arms, slapping the Young Palace Mistress with one hand then the other, in quick succession. At that moment, everyone stopped fighting as though by mutual agreement."
"那名弟子乍一看之下 , 其实很平凡。混在一堆幻花宫弟子之中 , 畏畏缩缩，眼神闪躲。 沈清秋之所以注意到他 , 是因为他脸上是一种颜色，脖子是一块颜色，左手和右手 , 又是两 种不同的颜色。而且 , 既不拔剑 , 也不作怒目相对状 , 只是不住地在幻花宫弟子间埋头擦来撞 去, 浑似个伺机行窃的扒手。 在沈清秋的认知里 , 只有一种人会是这种举止。 明帆焦灼道： “ 小师妹！师妹你怎么了？ ” 宁婴婴愣了半晌，仿佛被打傻了 , 这时才终于反应过来，挺剑回击。沈清秋见旁边有一只 老猫正懒洋洋蜷着尾巴晒太阳舔毛，一把提起，朝酒肆中扔去。 老猫受惊，一声尖叫，在两拨人间窜来窜去，沈清秋低着头喊了一句 “ 黑子别跑！ ” 就插身 进去。莫名其妙钻进来一个人，双方都怔了一怔。宁婴婴怕伤及无辜，下手略略迟疑。小 宫主却不管那么多，捡回了鞭子该怎么打还怎么打。沈清秋一边追着那只老猫满堂乱跑， 一边口里乱喊， “ 小花 ”“ 灰灰 ” 一堆乱七八糟的名字都安到那只猫头上。混战之中，宁婴婴 明明束手束脚不敢乱出招，却总感觉一会儿胳膊肘被人托了一把，一会儿肩膀给人推了一 掌，长剑几乎不用她操纵就舞得精光乱闪。忽然， “ 啪啪 ” 两声，响亮至极，小宫主捂着脸 ，呆若木鸡，僵住了。 两拨人全都看见刚才宁婴婴手臂挥舞，左右开弓甩了她两耳光，这时不约而同停了战。 明帆喝彩道： “ 师妹，打得好！ ” 宁婴婴弱弱地道： “…… 不，其实 …… 不是我 ……” 明帆鼓励道： “ 不要怕，打了就打了！谁都知道，是她先动手的。我们苍穹山派清静峰， 还怕了个幻花宫不成？ ” 宁婴婴： “ 不，真不是我 ……” 明帆： “ 清静峰的弟子挨了打，绝对要双倍奉还！ ” 沈清秋心中喝彩：明帆这孩子真是太有前途了，对对对，我就是这个意思！ 小宫主眼里泪光闪烁，沈清秋钻入了幻花宫弟子丛中，终于逮住了那只嗷嗷直惨叫的老猫 ，一边顺毛一边安慰道： “ 乖，捉着你啦。不怕哈。 ” 就算再怎么蠢，也该看出来不对劲了。 小宫主捧着脸，怨气冲天盯着他： “ 喂！你究竟是什么人？胆敢这样戏弄于我？ ” 幻花宫众弟子将他团团围住，喝道： “ 宫主在问你！ ” 沈清秋弯腰放走了那只猫，直起身子，指向那名缩在最后、鬼鬼祟祟的弟子，道： “ 你们 为什么不问问，他究竟是谁？ ” 众人目光立刻聚焦那人身上。 小宫主原本只是眼角一扫，谁知越看越不对劲，也暂时顾不得沈清秋了，转过头去，狐疑 道： “…… 你是谁？为什么我从来没见过你？ ” 她又转向属下： “ 你们呢？谁认识他？ ” 那弟子见势不好，大叫一声，众人纷纷调转矛头，对向他。沈清秋提气喝道： “ 别靠近 他！ ” 手中拈了另一枚青叶，翻腕弹去。 这次不止是宁婴婴，明帆见到这叶片去势，也愣住了。青叶挟灵光剑气破空而去，刮破那 弟子外服，露出里面的皮肉来。 这下，所有人神色都有如见鬼一般，连连退避，有些更是直接跳出了酒肆。 猩红色的皮肤！ 正合了沈清秋方才的猜测，在他的认知里，只有一种人会是这种举止。 伪装成普通人的撒种人。 他只有露在外面的部分涂成了常人肤色，其他地方却没做处理，此时暴露出来，干脆破罐 子破摔，满眼血丝，往前冲去，似乎要见谁搂谁。这些弟子多是年轻之辈，这种怪物只听 过没见过，真的出现在眼前，个个魂飞天外。沈清秋见那撒种人就快扑到清静峰一名弟子 身上，闪身在前，当胸一脚，踹得这东西砸飞两张桌子，外加鲜血狂喷。 沈清秋回头喝道： “ 还不走！ ” 宁婴婴却又哭又笑缠上来： “ 师尊，是师尊么？ ” 不是吧我胡子贴成这样你都认得出来？虽然有那么一点点小感动，但是这种时候不果断走 反而留下来并且叫出了他的身份  果然还是有点智硬！ 眼看那撒种人又顽强不屈地扑过来，沈清秋一手春天般温暖地把宁婴婴送了出去，一手冬 天般严寒地朝敌人弹出一个火诀。 没弹中。 不对，是没弹出来！ 沈清秋觉得潜伏在身体中多年的凌霄血又喉咙里在蠢蠢欲动了。 无可解这个就喜欢在关键时刻掉链子的毒药真是够了！ 一连打了好几个响指，一点火星子都没弹出来一个，就像个没油的打火机，咔嚓咔擦，硬 是擦不出火花。 沈清秋正气急败坏，撒种人已经扑上来抱住了他的大腿。 沈清秋： “……” 他下意识举起那只多灾多难的右手。果然，三颗红斑正欢快地生根发芽。 不公平！为什么每次传染他就这么快！ 也许是有了悲愤作为导火索，最后一个响指，终于在指间噌的燃起一团暴起的烈焰。沈清 秋踢飞抱住他大腿的撒种人，熊熊燃烧的一团火掌劈下去！ 撒种人的身躯被湮没在火光和惨叫声中。宁婴婴和明帆眼泪汪汪地一左一右夹上来： “ 师 尊！ ” 现在伪装也没啥意义了，沈清秋伸手在脸上一阵乱抹乱抓，恢复了原貌，道： “ 有没有人 受染的？ ” 然后语重心长地说出了他一直很想对别人讲的台词： “ 赶紧吃药，药不能停！ ” 一男一女在他耳边一高一低地哭： “ 师尊，可算找到你了，究竟是怎么回事啊 ……” 沈清秋还没回话，忽然感觉背脊一寒，推开两个徒弟，修雅剑从衣服中斥出，铛的一声， 格住了小宫主的精铁鞭。 如果说刚才与清静峰的口角里，小宫主还算只是一时气愤，这次出手，就是真的动了杀 心。一柄短鞭在她手里使得如刀劈斧砍。 沈清秋又问了一个他老早就想问的问题： “ 你发什么疯？ ” 小宫主满脸泪水，大哭大喊道： “ 你这贼奸人纳命来！还我师兄师姐的命来！ ” 沈清秋先还以为又是在哭仙盟大会幻花宫那些死伤的弟子们，谁知下一句，小宫主尖叫道 ：“ 你杀了公仪师兄，我杀了你！ ” 沈清秋灵流在指尖旋转，两根手指夹住她鞭梢。 他错愕至极： “ 你说什么？公仪萧死了？什么时候的事？谁干的？ ” 就算在原作里面，公仪萧最惨也只不过是被发配到幻花宫在偏远地区的分部打酱油去了 啊？！ 小宫主道： “ 谁干的？那要问你！ ” 幻花宫弟子呼啦一下全围了过来： “ 贼人，为水牢的守阵师兄师姐们报仇雪恨！ ” 沈清秋心中发凉。水牢守阵弟子，恐怕人数将近百人，难道一个不漏全被杀光了？ 宁婴婴怒道： “ 跟你这臭丫头怎么也说不清，没看见师尊也不知道这件事吗？ ” 清静峰弟子 登时也加入了混战。 沈清秋看刀剑无眼，再让他们这么斗下去也没有意义，来不及细想，翻身跃出酒肆，轻飘 飘扔下一句： “ 出来！ ” 果然，两方都顾不上互斗，追着他争先恐后挤了出来。 一站到大街上，沈清秋就无语了。整条街上，一大排服色各异的修士们正严阵以待。 毕竟酒肆里刚才闹得动静那么大，不被吸引过来也不太科学是吧 …… 沈清秋脚底一点，飞身上瓦，稳稳立在飞檐之上，深吸一口气，丹田发声： “ 柳  清  歌！ ” 有人御剑而起，怒斥道： “ 沈清秋，你好歹毒的心，故意逃到此地，把诸派的人手都引过 来，为的就是勾结魔族、在这里一网打尽，重演仙盟大会当初的惨剧？ ” 反正现在就是什么帽子往他头上扣都不嫌多对吧？！沈清秋定睛一瞧，这不是刚才被他支 使去撕衣服的那个什么 …… 霸气宗的头头吗？正想跟他沟通一下，东边传来剑气锐啸，一 人白衣御剑，风驰电掣而至。气势太过凌厉，无端带起一阵罡风，直把这人从自己剑上掀 了下去。 柳清歌稳稳踏在乘鸾剑上，道： “ 何事？ ” 太可靠了柳巨巨！ 沈清秋诚恳道： “ 带我飞。 ” 柳清歌： “……” 沈清秋道： “ 我毒性又发作了，提不起气御剑。勉强御剑，只有从高空栽下来。 ” 柳清歌叹了口气，道： “ 上来。 ” 底下围观众人斥责不休，什么 “ 苍穹山派藏污纳垢 ” 、 “ 百战峰清静峰同流合污 ” ，两人权当 听不见。乘鸾剑一天冲天，耳边风声猎猎，将身后御剑数十余人都远远甩下。 柳清歌道： “ 去哪儿？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 我得去城里最高的建筑的檐上。待会儿劳烦你帮我挡一挡这些人。 ” 柳清歌道： “ 你究竟怎么回事？入水牢也是你，逃水牢也是你。 ” 沈清秋道： “…… 没事儿，就是闲的。 ” 突然，柳清歌喝道： “ 跳。 ” 沈清秋： “ 啥？还没到呢。 ” 柳清歌： “ 有东西在朝这边过来。 ” 沈清秋二话不说，立马就跳，伏身定在一处屋檐上，柳清歌御剑在半空来了个眼花缭乱的 倒连翻，刹住了冲劲极强的乘鸾，凝神望向某处。沈清秋也跟着他去看。 却听身后传来一声嗤笑： “ 在看哪里？ ” 沈清秋险些当场一个趔趄。 那句 “ 你等着！ ” ，居然不是说说而已。 也对，洛冰河什么时候是 “ 说说而已 ” 的人过？ 居然冒着被心魔剑反噬的风险也要来擒拿他 …… 这是何等深重的怨念！ 洛冰河看上去彷如一尊内里裹着滔天怒火的冰雕，一点就开炸，一沾就结冰。 他死死盯着两人，朝沈清秋缓缓伸出一只手，道： “ 跟我走。 ” 沈清秋轻声道： “ 公仪萧死了。 ” 洛冰河身体一僵。 沈清秋继续道： “ 幻花宫水牢的守阵弟子也死了。 ” 洛冰河瞳孔中似乎有赤色一闪而过。 他冷冷地道： “ 反正我说什么你也是不会信的。废话少提，再问一次，你到底过不过来？ ” 他执拗地不肯收回那只手。沈清秋还未回答，四面忽然空降十余人，御剑将他们团团包围 在飞檐之上，为首的又是那名霸气宗的男子。他这次下盘微沉，似在剑上扎了个马步，防 止又被掀下去，嚷嚷道： “ 沈清秋是我们的，其他人谁也别想动。交给我们霸气 ……” 洛冰河猛地侧首，喝道： “ 滚！ ” 他连剑都没从剑鞘拔出，周身却迸发出一层强劲的灵流，在场众人耳内仿佛有哨声尖鸣， 这回，数十余人无一例外，连人带剑都被掀翻到数丈开外。 霸气宗弟子们遇上了真正霸道蛮横的气势，全军覆没。余下观望者无不悚然。 这黑衣青年修为如此了得，之前为何极少听说他名号？ 柳清歌一推沈清秋： “ 走！做你要做的事！ ” 沈清秋道： “ 不必。他交给我就行！ ”5:2 啊 5:2 ，这个数据他可没忘，他叫柳清歌来只是想 让他帮个忙打打杂鱼，顺便以防万一，可不让他送死的！ 可这两个都绝对不是战意冲天时肯好好听人说话的角色，一言不合，不对，是一言未发， 便大打出手。乘鸾剑势如长虹，洛冰河却没拔剑，手中运集灵力，以掌为刃，直面应击！ 沈清秋知道他为何不能拔剑。高手对决容不得一丝松懈，这种时候最容易被趁虚而入。众 目睽睽之下魔气侵脑、杀性大发，后果可不简单。洛冰河身体里其实有两套修炼系统，一 套灵气，一套魔气，因为混血混的够成功，两套系统互不干扰，各自运作良好，必要时候 还能左右手两种不同攻击方式合力发威。可现在第一，他不能拔剑，第二，他不便用魔气 ，杀伤力未免打个折扣，是以居然和柳清歌战成了平手。 飞檐上巨响震天，白虹共灵光齐爆炸，斗得太厉害，下面各派修士都不敢贸然插入。 再没见识没眼色的菜鸟新手也能看出来，被这两人的腾腾杀气擦中一点，那可不是好玩儿 的！ 他们打得这么激烈，沈清秋其实倒有些心痒，要不是无可解这小贱人发作的太不是时候， 他也真想上去打一打。奈何眼下太不是时候了。他眯眼望天，算着时辰将至，飞身跃上最 高那一层。高空中疾风呼啸，仿佛能把他吹落一般。 洛冰河远远望着，忽然一阵焦躁，无心恋战，眼底戾气陡升，反手覆上背后长剑剑柄。 他居然敢在这里拔剑？！ 沈清秋道： “ 洛冰河，你别冲动！ ” 洛冰河厉声道： “ 晚了！ ” 手腕翻转，心魔剑挟着一股肉眼可见的腾腾黑气祭出！ 乘鸾剑直刺而来，洛冰河在心魔剑那薄如蝉翼的剑刃上轻轻一弹，仿佛战栗之意从中一波 接一波漫出，乘鸾居然生生在半空中刹住。 柳清歌从来就没有遇到过这种乘鸾不听使唤的情况，一时间错愕难掩。沈清秋却知道事态 严重了。 真要让洛冰河现在被心魔反噬了，这些都不用活了，他自己也别当什么男主了！ 他拔出修雅剑，道： “ 洛冰河，你过来，今天是该做一个了断了。 ” 洛冰河抬头，阴沉沉望他一眼，下一刻，身形便闪现在他身前距离不到三尺处，再一举手 ，化开一个结界，罩住整个屋檐上方，把其他人都隔绝开来。 见沈清秋退了一步，洛冰河神色扭曲地笑道： “ 了断？你要如何了断？你我二人，现在难 道还断得清？ ” 怎么断不清？ 沈清秋轻吸一口气，虽然握剑在手，却没有要交锋的意思。事实上，他现在拿着这把剑也 做不了什么。 他道： “ 事到如今，我没什么好说的，只能说一句，果真，天命难违。 ” 统，系统 → 男主。 洛冰河嗤笑： “ 天命？天命是什么？就是任一个四岁孩童被欺辱却无人施以援手？让一名 无辜老妇被活活气死饿死？ ” 他说一句，走近一步，咄咄逼人： “ 还是让我跟一条狗抢东西吃？还是让我真心付出、倾 心相待的人欺骗我，抛弃我，背叛我，亲手把我推下炼狱不如的地方？！ ” 他道： “ 师尊，你现在看我这样，可你知道我在地下那三年是怎么过来的吗？ ” “ 在无间深渊里，三年之中，我每一时、每一刻，脑子里想的都是师尊。 ” “ 我了那么久，终于想明白了。 ” 洛冰河笑容之中，竟有狰狞之意。 “ 天命，要么根本就不存在，要么，就是该被践踏在脚底的东西！ ” 烈日当空，最后一丝云气也消散无踪，阳光 □□ 裸渡满整座城池，辉光灿烂，仿佛赤金遍 洒。 沈清秋把目光从天上收回。因为直视太阳，看起来竟有些泪光闪烁之感。 说起来，洛冰河走到今天这一步，他真是有很大责任。虽然是不得已而为之。 洛冰河见他神色忽然软和下来，不由怔了怔。可同时，头痛之感猛地剧烈起来。他咬牙攥 紧了有挣脱之势的心魔剑。 不行。至少不能在这里，被它反噬！ 沈清秋忽然柔声道： “ 别让它压制过你。 ” 这一声听来，恍如尤置身当年清静峰上。 洛冰河心神越发不稳，脑中似有利刃翻搅，心魔剑倏地黑焰大盛。这次来势凶猛，洛冰河 正剧痛难忍，忽然感觉被人轻轻环住了。 一股灵力如千里之堤倾塌，洪水席卷般灌入洛冰河体内，霎时将他强制压下的心魔戾气扑 熄，仿佛久旱之后的暴雨甘霖。 洛冰河气息平顺，运转无误，可心却瞬间凉了。 自爆！ 在下众人有人已经骇然叫出了声： “ 沈清秋自爆了！ ” 沈清秋放开洛冰河，慢慢往后退去，途中踉跄了一下。 修雅剑先坠了下去。主人已自爆灵力，人在剑在，半空中就已断为数截。 沈清秋总有把血往肚子里咽的习惯，此刻却任由鲜血狂涌。 爆了灵力以后，他现在就是连普通人都不如的废人一个，声音轻飘飘的，被风吹去了大 半。洛冰河却依然听得真切。 他说的是： “ 从前种种，今日一并还给你。 ” 算是最后做件好事吧。 然后，向后仰倒，从楼上坠了下去。 洛冰河原先只是呆呆看着，一切事物在他此刻的眼中，都被放慢了无数倍。连沈清秋下坠 的那一瞬间都慢得一举一动、清晰无比。在空中下落的躯体，仿佛一只染血的纸鸢。等到 洛冰河身体自己先动了起来，抢在他落地之前将他接住时，他才发现，沈清秋的身体轻而 薄，空荡荡的没有一丝灵力，真的就像一只纸鸢，一撕就坏。 甚至不用撕，已经散了。 他还没敢相信。 师尊不是憎恶他血统的吗？ 为什么不惜自爆灵体也要帮他压制住心魔剑的反噬？ 四周似乎有人嚷嚷 “ 魔头伏诛 ” 、 “ 大义灭亲 ” 之类的东西。 洛冰河脑子里混混沌沌，只是抱着沈清秋，喃喃叫道： “ 师尊？ ” 清静峰弟子终于赶到，宁婴婴早已听说洛冰河未死之时，乍见又惊又喜，可再看已平静闭 目的沈清秋。话到嘴头拐了个弯儿，颤颤巍巍道： “ 阿洛 …… 师尊 …… 他怎么了？ ” 柳清歌走来，唇边还带着血迹，沉着脸道： “ 死透了！ ” 众弟子呆若木鸡。 突然，明帆大叫道： “ 是谁杀的？！ ” 所有人目光都聚集在洛冰河身上。 虽然严格来说，不能算是洛冰河杀的，可沈清秋的确是在他面前自爆身亡的，这是实话。 明帆和身后一众弟子拔剑就要送死，柳清歌道： “ 你们打不过他。 ” 明帆双眼赤红： “ 柳师叔，那柳师叔总能杀了他，为师尊报仇吧？！ ” 柳清歌淡淡地道： “ 我也打不过他。 ” 明帆噎住了。 柳清歌擦去血迹，道： “ 沈清秋也不是他杀的。 ” “ 只是，虽非为他所杀，却是为他而死。 ” 柳清歌一字一句，犹如利剑出鞘： “ 此仇必报！ ” 洛冰河充耳不闻，方寸大乱，手足无措，还抱着沈清秋迅速冷下去的身体，像是想大声 叫、大力摇醒，却又不敢，怕被责骂一般，讷讷道： “ 师尊？ ” 明帆喝道： “ 你别叫师尊了，清静峰担当不起！师弟们，咱们上，打不过怎么的，最多被 他打死！ ” 宁婴婴却扬手拦住他。明帆气急攻心，以为宁婴婴还念着旧情，斥道： “ 小师妹，都现在 了，你怎么还拎不清呢？！ ” 宁婴婴道： “ 你闭嘴。你这么上赶着送死，师尊他知道吗？他知道会怎么说？师尊宁可自 己受染也不肯让我们吃亏受欺负，你就这样不惜命？ ” 她忽然强硬起来，明帆愣住了，半晌，眼泪流下来。 他涕泪齐流，凄凄惨惨地道： “ 可是 …… 这样的话，师尊也太冤枉了 ……” “ 明明不是他做的，所有人都要说他勾结魔族，关他进水牢 …… 连澄清的机会都没有。 ” 他哽咽道： “ 明明那么喜欢这小子 …… 仙盟大会之后，不肯把正阳剑交还给万剑峰，非要 自己留着在后山立剑冢 …… 伤心了好长一段时间 …… 最后就落到这种下场！ ” 洛冰河恍恍惚惚听着，似幻似真。 是这样吗？ 师尊其实也是 …… 很伤心的？ 宁婴婴上前一步，眼眶通红，却语气平稳。她道： “ 阿洛，金兰城之事，我们虽然不在场 ，但也都听过了。我不知道你为什么没死却不回苍穹山，不回清静峰，也不知道你为什么 不帮师尊说话，更不知道当时仙盟大会发生了什么，但是师尊多年养育栽培之恩，总不是 假的。 ” 顿了顿，她接道： “ 你要是觉得，师尊以往对你不好，也想想，你遗失玉佩那天的事。师 兄他们莫名其妙被击退，你应该自己心里也想过有不对劲的地方。摘叶飞花能作武器，小 施惩戒，清静峰上不会再有第二人。 ” 摘叶飞花？摘叶飞花？ 洛冰河不由自主搂紧了沈清秋。 他小声道： “ 我错了，师尊，我真的 …… 知道错了。 ” “ 我…… 我没想杀你的 ……” 宁婴婴大声道： “ 言尽于此。纵使师尊以往有对不住你的地方，你真的心里过不去那道坎 儿，今天总能算是一并都还给你了吧？从今往后，你 ……” 她说到这里，还是不忍，转过头去： “ 还是请你 …… 不必叫他师尊了。 ” “ 还” ？ 是。师尊刚才似乎是说过 “ 还给你 ” 。 难道就是指 …… 昔年将他打下深渊，今日就为他坠下高楼？ 洛冰河慌了起来。 “ 我不要你还。我 …… 我只是气不过， ” 他自言自语道： “ 我就是气不过你一见我就像见了 鬼，跟别人谈笑自若，却连话都不愿和我多说，还老疑心我 …… 我错了。 ” 他结结巴巴， 边说边去擦沈清秋脸上的血， “ 你不喜欢我是魔族，你是人界正道，我只是怕回苍穹山去，你会把我赶出来。我想把幻 花宫拿到手，是不是就能让你高兴 ……” 洛冰河颤声道： “ 师尊 …… 我真的 ……”","CHAPTER 43: THE PROTAGONIST DIES, EVERYTHING ENDS Ming Fan cheered, “Little apprentice-sister, great hit!” Ning Yingying said weakly, “No, it actually wasn’t me…” Ming Fan encouraged, “Don’t be afraidif you hit her then you hit her! Everyone saw that she started it. Even though other people haven’t hurt her out of the kindness of their hearts, she still launched a sneak attack on them. Serves her right!” All of the Qing Jing Peak disciples chimed in. Glistening teardrops glimmered in the Young Palace Mistress’ eyes. “You… you guys… how dare you hit me… my dad hasn’t even hit me before!” Ning Yingying, “No, it really wasn’t me…” Ming Fan cut her off and spat, “You’re the one who hit her! Remember, if the Qing Jing Peak’s disciples are being bullied, we must return it twofold! If we don’t, we’re unworthy of Shizun’s teachings!” Shen Qingqiu cheered in his mind with the rest of the disciples: this child Ming Fan really took his teachings to heart. Right right right, it was exactly like this: an eye for an eye! Shen Qingqiu stealthily slipped into the crowd of Huan Hua Palace disciples and finally caught that howling, shrieking old cat. No matter how stupid they were, they should still be able to tell that something wasn’t right. The Young Palace Mistress cupped her big red cheeks, which looked to be extremely cumbersome, and stared at him with a surge of resentment. “Hey! Who exactly are you? You have the audacity to make fun of me like this?” The Huan Hua Palace disciples encircled him completely and shouted, “Palace Mistress is asking you a question!” Shen Qingqiu bent down and released the cat. When he straightened, he pointed at the disciple that was hunched over, lurking in the very back. He said, “Why aren’t you guys asking who that is?” Everyone’s eyes instantly focused on that person. The Young Palace Mistress was currently in a fit of anger, and at first, only glanced at the disciple. Unexpectedly, the more she looked, the more she felt something wasn’t quite right and couldn’t be bothered with Shen Qingqiu for the moment. She looked over and said suspiciously, “Who are you? Why do you look like that? Are you really from the Huan Hua Palace? Why have I never seen you before?”This disciple faltered and didn’t speak. She turned towards her subordinates next. “What about you guys? Who knows him?” That disciple saw that things weren’t looking too good and let out a strange cry. Everyone pointed their swords at him. Shen Qingqiu sucked in a deep breath and shouted, “Don’t get close to him!” At the same time, he picked up another green leaf and flicked it over with a flip of his wrist. This time, Ming Fan also saw the force behind this leaf, not just Ning Yingying, and was stunned. The green leaf cleaved through the air with the glow of a sword’s spiritual energy and sliced open the disciple’s outer robe, exposing the skin and flesh inside. This time, everyone looked as if they had seen a ghost, and they kept backing away. Some of them even squawked and immediately ran out of the wine shop. Scarlet skin! It was exactly what Shen Qingqiu had guessed. Based on what he knew, there was only one kind of person who would carry themselves like that: a sower who had disguised itself as an ordinary human! Since it only painted its exposed limbs the same color as human skin and didn’t bother with the rest of its body, its identity was revealed on the spot. The sower decided that it basically had nothing to lose and charged forward with a loud yell and bloodshot eyes. Most of these disciples were young juniors that hadn’t gone to Jinlan City last time. They had only heard of this strange creature, but they had never seen it before. Yet at that moment, it actually appeared in front of them and, moreover, madly lunged at anyone in sight, scaring everyone out of their minds. Shen Qingqiu saw that the sower was about to throw itself onto a Qing Jing Peak disciple and flashed in front of it, smashing his foot into its chest. The kick sent the thing flying into two tables, violently spewing fresh blood. He looked back and shouted, “Why aren’t you leaving!” Ning Yingying was both crying and laughing at the same time. “Shizun, are you Shizun?” It can’t beyou can recognize me even with a yellowish-brown beard stuck all over my face? Even though he was a tiny bit touched, if she didn’t leave during a time like this and stayed behind to drag him down instead, even revealing his true identity underneath his disguisesure enough, her IQ was still low! When he saw that the sower was about to stubbornly rush over again, Shen Qingqiu used one hand to push Ning Yingying out warmly and gently whileusing his other hand to send out a fire attack coldly and severely. It didn’t hit. No, it was never sent out! The mouthful of blood that concealed itself in Shen Qingqiu’s body for many years rose sluggishly in his throat again. He really had enough of this ‘Without A Cure’ poison that liked to screw him over in critical moments! He snapped numerous times in a row, but not even a single spark appeared. It was just like a lighter that had run out of fuel, and no matter how many times he snapped, he just couldn’t ignite any sparks. Shen Qingqiu was flustered and exasperated, but the sower had already rushed over and latched onto his thigh. Shen Qingqiu, “…” He subconsciously raised his plagued-with-misfortune right hand. Indeed, three red spots appeared and started cheerfully spreading at a speed visible to the naked eye. This was unfair. Why did it infect him so fast every time! Maybe with his grief and indignation serving as fuel, his last snap finally caused an explosive ball of fire to kindle between his fingers. Shen Qingqiu sent the sower that was hugging his thigh flying with a kick before he cleaved downwards with the flaming fireball in his hand! The sower’s body was obliterated amidst the flames and sounds of shrieking. Ning Yingying and Ming Fan tearfully rushed forward, one on his right and one on his left. “Shizun!” The other Qing Jing Peak disciples also wanted to join in on the fun, but they were quickly forced to retreat by Shizun’s “go outside and run five hundred laps” gaze. Since his disguise was already ruined, Shen Qingqiu scrubbed his face with his hands and regained his original appearance. He asked, “Was anyone infected?” Then he sincerely and earnestly said the lines that he had always wanted to say to someone else: “Quickly, take medicine. You must not stop taking medicine!” A female voice and a male voice, one high and one low, sobbed into his ears. “Shizun, we finally found you.” “Shizun, this disciple has missed you so much!” Shen Qingqiu had yet to respond when his back suddenly grew cold. He pushed aside the two disciples as the Xiu Ya sword flew out from his robes and blocked the Young Palace Mistress’ iron whip with a clang.If the Young Palace Mistress could be described as being in a fit of fury during her previous dispute with the Qing Jing Peak, this time, her actions truly carried the intent to kill. In her hands was a short whip that could slice like a dagger and cut like an ax, vicious and threatening. Shen Qingqiu asked bluntly, “Are you crazy? Where do you get such vigorous anger from every day?” He had wanted to ask this question for a long time now! The Young Palace Mistress shouted loudly, “Traitor! Return my Shixiong and Shijie’s lives!” At first, Shen Qingqiu thought that she was crying about the Huan Hua Palace disciples who were killed or injured during the Immortal Alliance Conference again. Who knew that next, the Young Palace Mistress would scream, “All Ma Shixiong did was say something that wasn’t very nice when he was imprisoning you, yet you just… you just… he died so tragically, so tragically…” Who was Ma Shixiong? Could it be that bitter and sarcastic pockmarked fellow? Shen Qingqiu said, “When I left Huan Hua Palace, I did not take a single person’s life. What’s the significance of you telling me that he died tragically?” He looked back and asked quietly, “He really died? How tragically?” Ming Fan also answered softly, “He really died, very, very tragically. His whole body was blue and rotten, and they say that he was infected by the demon race’s poison.” ‘The demon race’s poison really did sound like something Luo Binghe would do. The Young Palace Mistress said, “There’s no use arguing! Today, I’ll make you pay for the death of my Huan Hua Palace’s disciples with your life!” Shen Qingqiu said, “All my life, I have never been good at using poison. There are thousands upon thousands of ways to kill your Huan Hua Palace’s disciples, so why would I select the most troublesome method? It’s true that I was escaping from prison, but who can prove that I killed someone?” A Huan Hua Palace disciple yelled, “Then who can prove that you didn’t kill someone?” If this knot wasn’t untangled now, he was afraid that the two great sects wouldn’t be able to let matters rest in the future. Shen Qingqiu deliberated for a moment before probing, “What does head disciple Gongyi Xiao have to say about this matter?” The Young Palace Mistress’ eyes opened wide, and the tears that she hadoriginally held back started to fall from her eyes again. “You still dare to mention Gongyi Shixiong?” She pointed her whip straight at Shen Qingqiu. “Do you think that just because he’s dead and there’s no evidence left, you can just make up whatever you want about him now?” Shen Qingqiu felt like he was struck by a thunderbolt. He caught the edge of her whip with two fingers and suspected that he’d heard something wrong. “What did you say? Gongyi Xiao died? When did that happen? Who did it?” Even in the original work, wasn’t the most tragic thing that happened to Gongyi Xiao the fact that he was assigned to go to Huan Hua Palace’s most remote region to do some trivial labor? The Young Palace Mistress said viciously, “Who did it? You still have the nerve to ask who did it!” All of the Huan Hua Palace disciples rushed forward at once, and she commanded, “Kill this despicable traitor, and get revenge for Gongyi Shixiong and the Shixiong and Shijie who were guarding the water dungeon!” Shen Qingqiu’s heart went cold. Did Luo Binghe kill all the disciples guarding the water dungeon, including Gongyi Xiao, without sparing anyone? Could these hundred plus human lives all be placed on his head? Ning Yingying said angrily, “We can’t ever explain things clearly to you, you stupid girl. Can’t you see that my Shizun also didn’t know about this?” The Qing Jing Peak disciples immediately entered into the fray as well. There were countless swords, and it was too late for Shen Qingqiu to think carefully. When he saw that only endless fighting would ensue if things continued like this, he leaped out of the wine shop and lightly called, “Come out!” Indeed, both sides couldn’t be bothered to keep fighting, and they scrambled to squeeze out of the shop. Once he landed on the street, Shen Qingqiu was speechless. A large group of cultivators who were all wearing different styles of clothing stood in a line, combat ready, glaring at him menacingly. Alright. After all, they had caused too much chaos inside of the wine shop just now, so it didn’t make much sense if people weren’t drawn over, right… With a tap of his foot, Shen Qingqiu leaped onto the roof before flipping over and standing on the upturned eaves. He sucked in a deep breath of air before shouting from his core, “LiuQingge!” Someone flew up on his sword and furiously rebuked, “Shen Qingqiu,you’re so evil. Did you purposefully run here and draw all of the manpower from various sects in a single place just so you could collude with the demon race and round up everyone in one fell swoop? Do you want to re-enact the tragedy of the Immortal Alliance Conference? My Ba Qi Clan won’t let you get your way!” They could just blame whatever they wanted onto him at this rate, couldn’t they? Shen Qingqiu wasn’t even in the mood to strike back. The sharp whistling sound of sword energy came from the east, and a person in white flew over on his sword as fast as lightning. He had too much momentum, and he needlessly created a strong gust of wind to the point that it threw the criticizing person off his own sword. Liu Qingge stood steadily on Cheng Luan, arms crossed. “What is it?” Too reliable, Renowned Master Liu 154 ! Shen Qingqiu said sincerely, “Take me away.” Liu Qingge, “…” Shen Qingqiu said, “My poison flared up again, so I can’t activate the energy to fly on my sword. If you don’t take me, I can only fall down from the sky.” Liu Qingge sighed. “Come up.” The crowd watching from below continued to endlessly denounce him with things like ‘the Cang Qiong Mountain sect is a pit of wickedness’ or ‘the Bai Zhan Peak and the Qing Jing Peak are partners in crime’, but both of them acted as if they couldn’t hear anything. The Cheng Luan sword shot towards the sky, the wind whistling in their ears, as they left the rest of the people on their flying swords far behind. Liu Qingge said, “Go where?” Shen Qingqiu said, “The roof of the tallest building in this town. Please help me keep these people away in a bit.” Liu Qingge said, “What on earth is up with you? If you didn’t want to go into the dungeon, why didn’t you say so earlier instead of making things so troublesome? Even if the Cang Qiong Mountain sect doesn’t know how to navigate the water dungeon, did you think we wouldn’t know how to tear it apart?” Shen Qingqiu said, “That… there’s no need to tear the water dungeon apart…” Liu Qingge said, “Get off.”Shen Qingqiu, “I only said that there was no need for it anymore, but actually, I’m still grateful for your good intentions. It isn’t necessary to throw me off, is it?” Liu Qingge, “Something’s coming.” Shen Qingqiu didn’t say anything else and instantly jumped down. The tips of his feet landed on the tiles, and he stood on the eaves of a roof. Cheng Luan’s momentum was extremely strong, so Liu Qingge did a dazzling backflip on his sword in the air before finally coming to a stop. He looked attentively off into the distance, and Shen Qingqiu followed his gaze to look over as well. But then, he heard a sneer come from behind him. “Where are you looking?” Shen Qingqiu narrowly avoided staggering off the roof on the spot. That ‘wait and see!’ unexpectedly wasn’t just lip service. That also made sense. Since when was Luo Binghe someone who gave lip service? Despite bearing the risk of the Heart Devil Sword’s counterattack, Luo Binghe actually still came to catch him… what a deep resentment. Luo Binghe stared unwaveringly at them, his expression gloomy. He slowly reached out a hand towards Shen Qingqiu and said, “Come with me.” Shen Qingqiu said, “Gongyi Xiao died.” Luo Binghe froze. Shen Qingqiu continued, “The disciples guarding the water dungeon also died. “Luo Binghe, was it really worth it to exchange over a hundred Huan Hua Palace lives just so that I would be hated by everyone?” Red flashed through Luo Binghe’s eyes. He said coldly, “You won’t trust anything I say regardless, so there’s no need for this nonsense! I’ll ask you one more timeare you going to come over or not?” He stubbornly refused to retract that hand. Shen Qingqiu still hadn’t answered yet when ten or so people suddenly appeared in the air around him on flying swords, completely surrounding them. The one in lead was that man from the Ba Qi Clan. This time, his body seemed to be a little lower, as if he was using the horse stance on his sword to prevent himself from being thrown off again. He yelled, “Shen Qingqiu is ours! No one else should even think about touching…”Luo Binghe violently turned his head and shouted, “Beat it!” He didn’t even unsheathe his sword before a powerful wave of energy burst out of him, and there seemed to be a high-pitched whistling noise in everyone’s ears. This time, all ten or so people were thrown several meters away, swords and all. Half of them even crashed into a wall or pillar, causing fresh blood to spurt from their mouths. The Ba Qi Clan encountered a truly powerful and overbearing aura and were completely wiped out. The observers left behind were all terrified: this black-clothed youth’s cultivation was extremely exceptional, so why had very few heard of his name before? Liu Qingge pushed Shen Qingqiu. “Go. Do what you have to do!” Shen Qingqiu said, “Can you handle him by yourself?” 5:2, ah, 5:2, he hadn’t forgotten this score. He had called over Liu Qingge only because he wanted him to help take care of some of the small fries and conveniently give him a lift along the way. He didn’t want to bring misfortune on his head! But these two were both characters who absolutely wouldn’t obediently listen to someone else. With some disagreementno, without a single word, they both started fighting. The Cheng Luan sword was extremely powerful, but Luo Binghe didn’t draw his sword. Instead, spiritual energy began to gather in his hand, and he faced the attack head-on, using his palm as a blade! Shen Qingqiu knew why he couldn’t draw his sword. There was no room for a single mistake during a duel between two masters, and this was the kind of moment where it was the easiest to be sucked into the void by the Heart Devil Sword. If the demonic energy invaded and seized his mind with killing intent while everyone was watching, then it wouldn’t be worth it. Luo Binghe actually had two cultivation systems in his body; one set was for spiritual energy, and the other was for demonic energy. Since his mixed blood had blended successfully enough, the two cultivation systems coexisted peacefully and worked well on their own. If needed, he could even use two different attacks in his right and left hands respectively and combine them to show off. But right now, first of all, he couldn’t draw his sword, and second, it wasn’t convenient for him to use demonic energy. There was no way to hold back its destructive power, and so, unexpectedly, he was on the same level as Liu Qingge. A burst of enormous noise shook the roof, and the white rainbow of spiritual energy exploded together. They were fighting too intensely, so the cultivators below who were from the various sects didn’t dare to just rashly rush in. Even a brainless rookie who had never experienced such a thing before couldsee that if they even barely touched the two’s murderous auras, they wouldn’t need cultivation to instantly fly away! They fought so fiercely that Shen Qingqiu also felt an itch in his heart. If it weren’t for Without A Cure activating at such an inconvenient moment, he truly would have also wanted to go up and fight a bit too. Unfortunately, time was about to be up. He narrowed his eyes and stared at the sky before leaping onto the tallest floor of the building. The wind whistled past him as he stood on the roof as if it could blow him right off. Luo Binghe looked at him from afar and suddenly felt a burst of impatience. He was in no mood to continue fighting, and ruthlessness rose sharply in his eyes as he placed his hand on the hilt of the long sword on his back. He actually dared to draw his sword here? Shen Qingqiu said hastily, “Luo Binghe, don’t be impulsive!” Luo Binghe said severely, “Too late!” With a flick of his wrist, the Heart Devil Sword slid out, surrounded by visible, seething black energy! Cheng Luan stabbed straight towards him, and Luo Binghe lightly tapped the edge of the Heart Devil Sword, which was as thin as a cicada’s wing. It seemed as if waves and waves of terrifying intent slowly oozed from the center of the sword, and Cheng Luan came to a complete stop in mid-air. Cheng Luan wasn’t obeying his command. Liu Qingge had never once encountered this kind of situation before, and his momentary shock was hard to conceal. But Shen Qingqiu knew that the situation was serious. If Luo Binghe was actually counterattacked by the Heart Devil Sword right now, then the people here in Huayue City and within a hundred kilometers all wouldn’t need to live anymore! As a last resort, the Xiu Ya sword left its sheath, and Shen Qingqiu said, “Luo Binghe, come here. We should settle things today.” Luo Binghe raised his head and looked at him darkly. In the next moment, he flashed to about three feet in front of him before raising his hand to create a formation that covered the entire upper half of the roof, cutting them off from everyone else. He laughed with a twisted expression. “Settle things? How do you want to settle things? Shizun, can you and I still settle things cleanly by now?” How could they not settle things cleanly? Shen Qingqiu drew in a light breath of air. Even though he was holdinghis sword in his hand, he had no intention of crossing blades. In reality, he couldn’t do much right now even with this sword. He said sincerely, “As matters stand, I have nothing much to say. As expected, even if every trick is used, it is difficult to disobey destiny.” Luo Binghe sneered, “Destiny? What’s destiny? Is it allowing a four-year- old child to be bullied and humiliated without anyone lending a helping hand? Is it letting an innocent old woman die from anger and starvation?” With every sentence, he took a step closer aggressively. “Or is it letting me fight with a dog over a scrap of food? Or is it allowing the person who I wholeheartedly, genuinely admired to deceive me, abandon me, betray me, and personally push me down into a place worse than purgatory?” He said, “Shizun, look. Am I strong enough the way I am now? “Do you know how I spent those three years underground? “During those three years in that endless abyss, all I did was spend every moment, every second, thinking about Shizun. “Thinking about why Shizun would treat me like this, why you wouldn’t even give me a chance to explain or beg for mercy. “You want me to acknowledge that this is the destiny that the heavens assigned me? “I thought about it for so long, and I finally understand now.” In Luo Binghe’s smile, there was a hint of savagery. “None of that is important, it’s enough if I do what I want to do. Destiny doesn’t exist at all, or if it does, then it’s something that should be trampled underneath my feet!” The scorching sun was directly overhead, and the last of the clouds also vanished without a trace. Sunlight flooded the entire city, causing everything to glow radiantly as if pure gold had been spilled all over the land. Shen Qingqiu looked away from the sky. Because he had been looking directly at the sun, it seemed as if there were some tears glistening in his eyes. Even though there had been no other alternative, he truly had played a large role for Luo Binghe to reach this point today, turning him into a dark youth who was vindictive against society. His original intention had been to prevent Luo Binghe from going to the extremes, but everything he did not only failed to achieve any real purpose, but also carved Luo Binghe’s hatred and resentment even deeper into him. When Luo Binghe saw his expression, he suddenly softened and couldn’t help but be a little dazed. But simultaneously, a fierce, sharp headache piercedhis head. He clenched his teeth and gripped the Heart Devil Sword tightly, which was attempting to struggle free. Not good. At the very least, he couldn’t be counterattacked by it here! Suddenly, Shen Qingqiu said in a soft voice, “Don’t let it suppress your heart.” When he heard this voice, he was suddenly taken back to his years at Qing Jing Peak. It was even more difficult for Luo Binghe to control himself. It felt as if there was a sharp knife churning his mind, and the black flames surrounding the Heart Devil Sword abruptly surged out. This time, it pressed down on him violently, and Luo Binghe was struggling to endure the severe pain when he suddenly felt someone gently embrace him. Like the collapse of a vast dam, a burst of spiritual energy flooded into Luo Binghe’s body, bringing a relief akin to a torrential rainstorm after a long drought. In an instant, it extinguished the evil energy of the Heart Devil sword that he was currently in a deadlock with. Luo Binghe’s breathing evened out and everything returned to normal, but immediately, his heart went cold. Self-destruction! Some of the people below the roof were already gasping and shouting, “Shen Qingqiu self-destructed!” Shen Qingqiu let Luo Binghe go and slowly moved backward, staggering once. The Xiu Ya sword fell first. Its master had already self-destructed his spiritual energy, and a sword was only there if its master was. It broke into numerous pieces in midair. Shen Qingqiu always had the bad habit of swallowing his blood back down his throat, but at that moment, he couldn’t swallow it down anymore. After his spiritual energy destructed completely, he was now a good-for- nothing that was even worse off than an ordinary, common person. His voice was light and buoyant, and most of it was blown away by the wind, but Luo Binghe still heard it clearly. What he said was: “Everything that’s happened in the past, I’ll repay it all to you today.” It could be considered a final act of kindness. Afterward, he toppled backward and fell from the roof.At first, Luo Binghe only stared blankly at him, and it was as if everything had been slowed down several times for him in that second. Even the moment where Shen Qingqiu fell was so slow that it was incomparably clear. The body that was falling in mid-air was like a bloodstained paper kite. It was only when Luo Binghe’s body started to move on its own, fighting to catch Shen Qingqiu before he hit the ground, that he discovered Shen Qingqiu’s chest was light and flimsyhis entire body was empty of spiritual energy. He truly seemed like a paper kite that would break with one tear. He didn’t even need to tear anything. It was already broken. He still didn’t dare believe it. Didn’t Shizun loathe his kind the most? Wasn’t he always unwilling to get close to him? Didn’t he draw a clear line between them? Then why would he tell him to control his heart so gently, as gently as back then, at the last moment? … why did he not hesitate to self-destruct his soul and help Luo Binghe suppress the Heart Devil Sword’s counterattack? It seemed that there were people shouting things like ‘execute the demon’ and ‘righteousness above loyalty’ all around him. The inside of Luo Binghe’s head was a muddled mess, and he could only hold onto Shen Qingqiu and murmur, “Shizun?” The Qing Jing Peak disciples and Huan Hua Palace disciples fought each other the entire way over before they finally reached them. Ning Yingying had long since heard that Luo Binghe wasn’t dead, and she was both surprised and happy to be reunited with him, but then she saw Shen Qingqiu, whose eyes were already closed peacefully. The words she was about to say suddenly changed, and she said, trembling, “A-Luo… Shizun… what’s wrong with him?” Liu Qingge walked over. There was still a trace of blood next to his lips, and he said with a heavy expression, “He’s dead!” All the disciples were dumbstruck. Suddenly, Ming Fan shouted, “Who killed him?” Everyone’s eyes landed on Luo Binghe. Even though, strictly speaking, Luo Binghe couldn’t really be regarded as the one who killed him, but Shen Qingqiu indeed self-destructed and died in front of him. Ming Fan and the crowd of disciples behind him all drew their swords, ready to strike. Liu Qingge said, “You all cannot defeat him.”Ming Fan’s eyes bled crimson. “Liu Shishu! Then Liu Shishu can kill him and get revenge for Shizun, right?” Liu Qingge said evenly, “I also cannot defeat him.” Ming Fan choked. Liu Qingge wiped away the traces of blood next to his lips and said, “He didn’t kill Shen Qingqiu. “But although he was not killed by him, he did die for him,” Liu Qingge said, one word at a time, like a sharp sword being drawn, “The Cang Qiong Mountain sect must avenge this wrongdoing!” Luo Binghe turned a deaf ear to everything else, greatly agitated and at a loss of what to do. He was still holding Shen Qingqiu’s body, which was rapidly cooling down. It seemed like he wanted to call for him loudly and forcefully shake him awake, yet he didn’t dare to, as if he was afraid of being scolded. He said slowly, “Shizun?” Ming Fan shouted, “Stop calling him Shizun already, he can’t bear the responsibility of being called your Shizun! My fellow Shidi, who cares if we can’t defeat him? At the most, we’ll just be beaten to death by him!” Ning Yingying raised a hand to stop him. Ming Fan was seized by an outburst of anger, and he thought that Ning Yingying was still recalling her former affection for Luo Binghe. He accused, “Little apprentice-sister, it has already reached this point. Why are you still being childish?” Ning Yingying said, “Shut up. Even if you rush up and court death, would Shizun know? What would he say if he knew? Shizun would rather himself be infected before letting us suffer or be taken advantage of. This is how little you treasure your life?” For so many years, Ning Yingying always had the charming attitude of a young maiden. When she suddenly grew unyielding at that moment, Ming Fan was completely stunned. After a long pause, tears abruptly started to fall from his eyes. He sniffled and sobbed as he said miserably, “But… if it’s like this, Shizun was wronged too much… “Clearly, he didn’t do it, yet everyone said that he colluded with the demon race, that he killed people, that he’s scum, so they shut him in the water dungeon… he didn’t even have a chance to clear his name.” He was choked with sobs. “Clearly, he liked this brat so much… he even bet five thousand spirit stones on him during the Immortal Alliance Conference, carrying such high expectations for him. He was so happy when other peoplepraised him… afterward he wasn’t willing to return the Zheng Yang sword to Wan Jian Feng, insisting on keeping it and making a sword mound behind the mountain… he was heartbroken for such a long time… and in the end, this is the kind of fate that he meets!” Luo Binghe listened faintly as if he was half in a dream and half in reality. Was that how it was? Back then, Shizun was also actually… very heartbroken? Ning Yingying took a step forward, and though the rims of her eyes bright red, the tone of her voice was steady. She said, “A-Luo, even though we weren’t there during the debacle at Jinlan City, we all heard about it. I don’t know why you didn’t return to Cang Qiong Mountain sect or the Qing Jing Peak even though you didn’t die, and I also don’t know why you didn’t speak up for Shizun. I know even less about what exactly happened at the Immortal Alliance Conference. But at the very least, Shizun’s kindness to raise you and train you throughout the years, as well as his tender affection for you and his desire to protect you, were not fake. Everyone knew this naturally.” After a pause, she continued, “If you feel that Shizun wasn’t good to you a very long time ago, then think of the day you lost your jade pendant. Shixiong and the rest were inexplicably beaten back, and you must have also thought that something wasn’t quite right. There isn’t another person on Qing Jing Peak who would pick leaves and send them flying as weapons to teach others a small lesson.” Luo Binghe involuntarily held Shen Qingqiu closer. He said in a small voice, “I was wrong, Shizun, I really… know that I was wrong. “I… I didn’t want to kill you…” Ning Yingying said loudly, “Everything that needs to be said has already been said. Even if there was once a time that Shizun was unfair to you or there’s some grudge that you can’t let go of in your heart, today everything can be considered to have been repaid to you, right? From today onwards, you…” When she reached this part, she still couldn’t bear it and looked away. “I ask that you… do not call him Shizun anymore.” “Repay”? Yes. It seemed that Shizun had said he would “repay it all” to him just then. Could it be that he was referring to… when he struck him down into the abyss in the past, so today, he would fall from a high building for him?Luo Binghe panicked. “I don’t need you to repay me. I… I just couldn’t control my anger,” he said out loud to himself. “I just couldn’t control my anger, since you acted as if you saw a ghost every time you saw me. You went on talking and laughing with other people as if nothing had happened. You were like that only with me in the past, but now you aren’t even willing to speak to me, always suspecting me… I was wrong.” He stammered and stuttered, wiping the blood off of Shen Qingqiu’s face as he spoke. “You don’t like the fact that I’m part of the demon race, so I was afraid that if I went straight back to the Cang Qiong Mountain sect, you would chase me out. I thought that if I could seize the Huan Hua Palace and become a peak lord of the righteous path like you, maybe that would make you happy…” Luo Binghe said in a trembling voice, “Shizun… I… I really…”"
"边境之地。 晚来风急，在屋丛疏落的小镇中呼啸而过。 整条街上 , 居然只有一家小茶肆中透出些暖黄的灯光来 , 这才有了点人气。 所谓的边境之地 , 并非国与国或城与城的接壤之地 , 而是魔界与人界的交界之处。 两族分属异界，原本中间还隔着一个撕裂空间的无间深渊 , 可总有那么一些地方 , 异界隔离 结界薄弱 , 时空错乱 , 经常能见到两界居民互穿乱窜，恶意偷渡越界事件也时有发生。 没有哪些正常人愿意生活在魔族神出鬼没、今天偷鸡摸狗明天杀人放火的地方 , 是以 , 边境 之地人烟会越来越稀少。即便曾经是繁华之都，一旦异界空间泾渭不分明，最后多半会来 一场大迁徙，只剩下修真界派来的弟子们孤守边境。 卢六给新来的斟上一碗热酒，跟着几人围着炉子寒暄： “ 兄弟打哪儿过来？ ” “ 南边过来的。 ” “ 那边啊？ ” 几人面面相觑，做个了然神色： “ 现在不好过吧。 ” 新来的捧着酒碗，愁眉道： “ 谁说不是？三天两头就要打一场，谁也扛不住这么个折腾法 儿啊。 ” 角落里有人插嘴道： “ 苍穹山和幻花宫同属四大派之一，怎么这些年闹得这么厉害？两边 弟子就没有一见面不大打出手的，这俩掌门，就不给管管？ ” 卢六道： “ 你是在这鸟不拉屎的鬼地方呆多少年了，不问事也太久了。正是两派掌门默许 ，弟子们才越发狠起来斗啊！ ” “ 这是为啥？六哥你给说说呗。 ” 卢六清清嗓子，道： “ 这说起来可复杂得很了，你们知道现在幻花宫的头儿是谁？ ” “ 听说是个毛头小子。 ” 卢六冷笑道： “ 洛冰河能被叫做毛头小子，你我都白活了。要说这洛冰河，可不简单，他 出身苍穹山派，乃是清静峰沈清秋座下首徒。当年那一届仙盟大会，高居榜首，那叫一个 风光。 ” 旁人疑惑道： “ 苍穹山出身，那他怎么就能当上幻花宫的头儿？ ” “ 仙盟大会后，洛冰河失踪三年，三年里谁也不知道他去过哪儿、干过什么，沈清秋当时 说他已身陨，于是，所有人都确信他已经死了。谁知，三年后，他卷土重来，还成了幻花 宫举足轻重的人物，在金兰城逼得沈清秋当场自爆。 ” 新来的道： “ 这事儿我一直弄不明白。这沈清秋，到底是冤枉的，还是该死的？ ” 卢六道： “ 到现在也说不清。苍穹山派那肯定是一致对外的，谁提打谁。他们家一向都这 幅姿态，连安定峰尚清华叛逃入魔界这板上钉钉的事儿，他们都不许旁人多嘴。金兰城之 事后，幻花宫没多久就易主了，老宫主退隐，连个人影都见不到，换洛冰河把持大权，谁 提杀谁。 ” 有人咕哝道： “ 就因为个死人啊。 ” 卢六道： “ 这死人搅出来的风波不小呢。沈清秋是苍穹山派的人，还是十二峰峰主之一， 他的尸体，肯定要回清静峰跟历代峰主葬在一起的  可问题是，洛冰河不肯交还尸体 啊。 ” 众人都想到了鞭尸曝尸一类的东西，悚然： “ 不肯还，苍穹山派难道不会硬抢？百战峰峰 主还在呢。 ” 卢六摊手： “ 打不过。 ” “ 啥？！ ” 众人三观毁灭。百战峰在他们心中的定位，那就是不败战神，实在不能接受。 卢六道： “ 你们都不知道？百战峰柳清歌自从金兰城后，跟洛冰河交手无数次，就没一次 赢过的！这还没完。洛冰河把沈清秋尸体带回幻花宫，没过几天，就亲自把千草峰的木清 芳给截了。 ” 有人道： “ 千草峰向来不问世事，救死扶伤，怎么就招惹这个混世魔王了？ ” 卢六道： “ 洛冰河把人押到幻花宫，让他治活沈清秋。 ” 他唏嘘道： “ 人都硬了，还治什 么？ ” 新来的道： “ 我看两边打架的时候，苍穹山派的总爱叫幻花宫魔族走狗，这又是什么典 故？ ” 卢六道： “ 这是因为苍穹山全派上下不知怎么回事，都一口咬定洛冰河是魔族血统。不过 ，昭华寺数位方丈亲鉴，洛冰河体内灵气运转正常。苍穹山派还是一直坚持这么叫 …… 这 你来我往冤冤相报的，两派梁子越结越大。我看，总有一天大船齐齐翻，谁都不用活，所 以啊， ” 他说到最后，不忘自我安慰一下： “ 像我们这样被打发来守界的，自在清闲，倒也 算是件好事。 ” 角落里那人糊涂道： “ 我已经搞不清楚，这对师徒和这两派到底怎么回事了。 ” “ 仇深似海是一种解释，不过还有另外一种解释 ……” 卢六正要兴致勃勃地八卦下去，忽然 ，门外传来一阵扣扣之声。 屋内众人立刻齐齐警觉，方才的惫懒倦怠一扫而光，各自备好兵刃法器。 边境之地人烟罕至，荒凉异常，整个镇常驻的守界人只有他们一队，外出巡逻的不会这么 快回来，而所剩无几的居民更不会大半夜作死出来闲逛。 屋内无人应答，半晌，木门又被 “ 扣、扣 ” 敲了两下。 卢六厉声道： “ 是谁！ ” 忽然，一阵阴风吹过，扑熄了桌上油灯与烛火，屋子霎时漆黑一片，只剩炉碳暗红的光幽 幽燃烧。 门窗纸上映出一个背剑男人的影子，那人朗声道： “ 六哥，是我啊。今天太冷了，我就先 回来了，快开门让我进来喝杯酒暖暖。 ” 其余人松了口气，骂道： “ 要死吗你老秦，光敲门不说话，不知道还以为你被鬼吃了！ ” 门外那人嘿嘿一笑。卢六心里觉得不对劲，可也捉不住那根弦，嘴里道： “ 进来吧！ ” 便打 开了门。 门外一阵冷风扑面吹入，空空如也。 卢六啪的把门关上，沉声道： “ 点灯。 ” 新来的手微微发抖，转身捏了个火诀，火光颤颤映出了几条人影，他还没点蜡烛上，又转 了回来，吞吞吐吐道： “ 六哥，我 …… 我想问问你。 ” 卢六不耐烦道： “ 磨蹭什么？ ” 新来的道： “ 咱们这屋里子，原先是只有六人对吧？ ” “ 可我怎么现在看着 …… 像有七个？ ” 死寂。 突然，一声暴喝，不知是谁先动的手，惨叫与兵刃相击声高低不一。卢六大喊 “ 灯起！灯 起！ ” 众人连忙都施了火诀，但动作太乱，火光乱晃，人影狂摇，晃得人眼睛发昏，反而 越发看不清谁是谁，众人怕伤到自己人，都不敢下狠手，叫摸进来的那个东西浑水摸鱼， 这里一爪子那里一刀。卢六正恼恨，忽然被掐住了脖子。 他白眼上翻，双脚渐渐离地，看不清掐自己的是什么。正当以为要命绝于此时。大门蓦地 往两边弹开，狂风席卷而入。 一条人影气势汹汹闯入。 也不见他如何拳打脚踢，卢六耳边听到一声怪叫，似乎是掐自己的东西发出来的，随后喉 咙一松。 屋内六人惊魂未定，有的已经横躺在地。那人打个响指，屋内数盏油灯齐齐亮起。 他低头察看片刻，起身道： “ 无碍。晕过去了。 ” 这人浑身黑泥，活像刚从坟里刨出来的，而且满脸胡子，密密遮满五官，明明身形清癯， 脸却搞得像个虬髯大汉。卢六盯着他上上下下打量半晌，才一抱拳道： “ 多谢阁下相救！ ” 那人一把搭在他肩膀上： “ 在下有一事相询。 ” 卢六： “ 请讲。 ” 对方道： “ 现在是什么年了？ ” 沈清秋浑身泥土连滚带爬从山上栽下来时，真是想把向天打飞机爆个一万遍。爆灵体还是 □□ 花都随便。 当初他设想的最多的报名法子，其实是假死。 但是假死有什么意思？ 傀儡假死金蝉脱壳，电视剧都玩儿的不要得了。 所以他用的法子是真死。 当日他可是实实在在自爆了，顺便把洛冰河身体里大部分暴走的魔气都引渡过来，灵脉说 是粉身碎骨都不为过。 置之死地，方可后生。 日月露华芝被简称为 “ 肉芝 ” ，完全是字面意思。此芝虽然于修炼没啥大用，但好歹是集天 地之灵气日月之精华长成，如果将它的幼苗圈养在一处灵气充沛的土地，加以引导栽培， 精心塑型，血气浇灌，成熟之时，就可以种出 * 活躯。肉身可以长成，但魂魄却无法用这 种办法创造，也就是说，种出来的是一个没有魂魄的空壳子，拿来做容器再适合不过了。 “ 春天种下一个小小沈，秋天就能收获一个大沈 ” ，不再是梦想！ 露华芝不是大白菜，浇点粪水也能养活，沈清秋种废了好几株肉芝的幼苗，才种出了一棵 没长歪的。 尚清华与他早早算好了各地坐标，进行远程操作。于花月城最高建筑的地底，设下传送阵 法，在日光最盛之时，尚清华在苍穹山上再设一个推送阵法，沈清秋一旦魂魄离体，就会 被传送到早就埋在边境深山的成熟露芝之中。 三个地点，三个法阵，直线连起来就是一个最稳定的等边三角形大循环，绝对稳定，绝对 靠谱。 唯一的瑕疵在于某个人。 向天打飞机菊苣真是太靠谱了。 虽然没出现沈清秋之前担心的 “ 胳膊大腿没长齐 ” 或者 “ 关键部位断了一截 ” 这种错漏，但是 用化学肥料催熟的日月露华芝，果然有副作用的。 刚醒来的时候，沈清秋静静等了一会儿，没听到那可恨的谷歌翻译腔的提示音。 他心中狂喜：系统没出来，哈哈哈系统没出来！劳资换硬件了不装你个病毒软件了哈哈 哈！虽然只是暂时放下了心，但也忍不住手舞足蹈 …… 手舞足蹈个屁。 他整个身体还埋还在土里动弹不得啊！ 埋了一天，从指间蓄力，直到能操控肢体，沈清秋才哆哆嗦嗦爬出来。 破土而出的刹那，他还没来得及陶醉在清新自由的空气里，就一头栽倒。啊，身体又不听 使唤了，一头栽倒。 整整一天，边走边做广播体操直到晚上，沈清秋行动姿势才看起来像个正常人，好歹没有 再同手同脚了。 人形的模子，用的是他前世沈垣的容貌。不如沈清秋仙风道骨，却也算个不错的皮囊，就 是有点儿小白脸混吃等死的颓废之感。可因为养露芝的时候，用了一部分他的血骨，无论 如何也会有影响。沈清秋滚到溪水边用一块锐利的山石刮了胡子一看，这张脸仍然和沈清 秋十分里有八分相似。他又默默无言地把胡子捡起来贴回脸上了。 好不容易滚下山之后，抓来这个路人一问  卧槽居然已经过了五年！ 他可以理解刚醒来的时候身体不协调或者偶尔不能动是因为需要一段时应配置的磨合期， 但是埋了五年才醒这是怎么回事？！ 好吧，吐槽归吐槽，沈清秋对现在这个状况还是比较满意的。这具身体 …… 简直灵力爆 棚！ 原先沈清秋的身体，没有无可解时不时捣乱的话，也算灵力充沛了，只是跟现在这种感觉 一比，就像两格电（够用）程度和满格电（刚充完电拔下了插头）的程度。或者直接说他 自己就是一台发电机都行！简直比脱胎换骨，易筋洗髓还剽悍。 这是不是他也要开挂的节奏？！ 沈清秋觉得他好像捡起了一点点重生者尊严！ 卢六道： “ 守境人居然还要牢阁下相救，真是惭愧。刚才那东西 ……” 沈清秋听他讲完刚才之事，道： “ 这东西，大概不是魔界来的。能模仿熟悉之人身形和语 音，不受屋主邀请就不能进门，似乎是鬼界的 ‘ 不速之客 ’ 。这两界相通，从边境破口涌入 也不是什么值得惊讶的事。 ” 这种生僻的鬼怪也能信手拈来，众人淡淡钦佩之余也略感好奇，这人是怎么突然出现在边 境之地的。卢六道： “ 近些年魔族入侵越来越严重，连其他的妖邪之辈也跟着一起涌入人 间了。一场大战恐怕在即 …… 哦，还未请教阁下仙号？ ” 沈清秋一句 “ 呵呵在下不才中原苍穹山派清静峰峰首修雅剑沈清秋 ” 没到喉咙就来了个急转 弯。好险好险，差点就报上了旧号。他一时想不到别的名号，沉吟片刻，定定吐出四字： “ 绝世黄瓜。 ” 决定了，前尘往事如烟，从今往后，行走江湖，就用这个纵横书评区多年的 id 吧。 言毕，沈清秋飘然离去。只剩下一室人石化风中。 半晌，新来的喃喃道： “ 他刚刚说的是 …… 绝世 …… 什么来着？ ” 卢六猜测道： “ 绝世 …… 黄花？ ” “ 难道不是绝世皇冠吗。 ” “ 不不不，似乎是绝世狂花！ ” 沈清秋走出数丈之外，脚底打了个滑。 那啥，回头还是再想想，换个称号吧 ……","CHAPTER 44: MANUAL REBIRTH At the border. The night breeze was swift as it whistled through the tiny town between its scattered houses. Along the entire street, only one small teahouse leaked warm light, giving it a bit of life. The so-called ‘border’ wasn’t the boundary between two countries or two cities, but rather the demon world and human world. The two races were separated into different worlds. Originally, there was still a space-rending Endless Abyss that served as a partition in the middle, but there were always a few weak spots in the formation that kept the two worlds apart, causing time and space to be in disorder. One could often find residents of both worlds passing through those spots to run away, and things like maliciously sneaking across the border was a common occurrence as well. No normal person would want to live in a place where the demon race came and went like shadows, stealing things one day before committing murder and arson the next. Therefore, the population at the border became more and more scarce. Even though it used to be a flourishing metropolis, many people moved away once the space between the different worlds started to blur together. Only the disciples of the sects that came to mend the boundary stayed behind to guard the border. Lu Liu poured a bowl of hot wine for the newcomer, exchanging greetings with him and a few other people as they surrounded the stove. “Brother, where did you come from?” “From the south.” “Oh, from there?” The people glanced at each other before making understanding expressions. “It isn’t easy to cross that area right now, is it?” The newcomer held up his bowl of wine and frowned. “Who said it is? There’s a fight almost every day. Nobody can handle this kind of suffering.” Someone chipped in from the corner, “Cang Qiong Mountain and Huan Hua Palace can both be considered one of the four big sects, so why have they stirred up so much trouble these past few years? Disciples from either side can’t go a day without fighting if they see each other. Why don’t the two Sect Masters do something about it?” Lu Liu said, “How many years have you stayed in this cursed, god- forsaken place? You’ve been gone for too long. These disciples only fight sofuriously because those two Sect Masters tacitly agreed to it!” “Why’s that? Brother Liu, you should explain it a bit.” Lu Liu cleared his throat and said, “This is complicated to explain. Do you guys know who the current head of the Huan Hua Palace is?” “I heard that it’s a young brat.” Lu Liu laughed coldly. “If Luo Binghe can be called a young brat, then both you and I don’t need to live anymore. It’s no simple task if we’re going to talk about this Luo Binghe. He came from Cang Qiong Mountain sect and was Qing Jing Peak’s Shen Qingqiu’s head disciple. Back then, during the Immortal Alliance Conference, he topped the rankings by a large margin. That was truly impressive.” Someone else said, unconvinced, “If he came from Cang Qiong Mountain sect, then how can he be the head of Huan Hua Palace?” “After the Immortal Alliance Conference, Luo Binghe went missing for three years, and nobody knew where he went or what he did during those three years. At that time, Shen Qingqiu said that he had passed away, so everyone believed that he was already dead. Who would’ve thought that, three years later, he would make a comeback as a key figure in Huan Hua Palace? He forced Shen Qingqiu to self-destruct then and there at Huayue City.” The newcomer said, “I never could understand that. Was this Shen Qingqiu wronged, or did he deserve to die?” Lu Liu said, “Who can say. The Cang Qiong Mountain sect has definitely been united in their treatment towards outsiders: they beat up whoever mentions it. Their sect has been like that all along; they recognize family, not logic. They don’t even allow other people to gossip about something resolute and final like An Ding Peak’s Shang Qinghua defecting to the demon world. Not long after what happened at Huayue City, Huan Hua Palace’s peak position changed hands. The Old Palace Master retired, and now you can’t even find his shadow anymore. Luo Binghe became the dominant authority, and if anyone brought it up, he’d kill them.” Someone muttered, “Just because of a dead person.” Lu Liu said, “The disturbance that this dead person created wasn’t small. Shen Qingqiu was someone from Cang Qiong Mountain sect, and he also used to be the Second Peak’s Peak Lord. His body definitely should have been sent back to Qing Jing Peak to be buried with the previous Peak Lordsbut the problem is, Luo Binghe refused to return the body.” Everyone thought of Luo Binghe doing something like whipping thecorpse and putting it on display, and the hairs on their bodies stood on end. “If he refuses to return it, wouldn’t Cang Qiong Mountain sect forcefully steal it back? Bai Zhan Peak’s Peak Lord is still here.” Lu Liu shrugged. “He can’t defeat him.” “What?” Everyone’s world views were destroyed. In the common people’s minds, Bai Zhan Peak’s Lord had always been like an undefeatable battle god. “He can’t defeat him” was something that was … truly unacceptable. Lu Liu said, “You guys don’t know? After Huayue City, Bai Zhan Peak’s Liu Qingge fought countless times with Luo Binghe, but he never won once! That’s not the end of it either. When Luo Binghe brought Shen Qingqiu’s body back to Huan Hua Palace, only a few days passed before he personally abducted Qian Cao Peak’s Mu Qingfang.” Someone said, “Qian Cao Peak has always disregarded worldly affairs, healing the wounded and rescuing the dying. How did he provoke this tyrant?” Lu Liu said, “Luo Binghe dragged him to Huan Hua Palace and told him to revive Shen Qingqiu.” He sighed as he said, “His corpse had already stiffened. What was there to revive?” The newcomer said, “When I saw the two sides fighting, Cang Qiong Mountain sect always liked to call Huan Hua Palace ‘the demon race’s lackey.’ Why do they say that?” Lu Liu said, “That’s because the entire Cang Qiong Mountain sect, for some reason, continues to insist that Luo Binghe is associated with the demon race. Even though countless Zhao Hua Temple elders personally inspected him and found that the spiritual energy in Luo Binghe’s body works normally, Cang Qiong Mountain sect still persistently calls him that… they continue to seek revenge on each other, and the hatred between the two sects just keeps growing and growing. In my opinion, there’ll be a day when everything boils over and nobody will need to live anymore.” When he got to the end, he didn’t forget to console them a bit. “It can also be considered a good thing that we were sent to guard the border, leisurely and idly.” The person in the corner said, confused, “I still don’t understand what happened between this pair of master and disciple and the two sects.” “One explanation is a hatred as deep as the sea. But there’s still another explanation that I, Old Lu, find more believable. Let me tell you guys…” Lu Liu was about to happily continue speaking when, suddenly, the sound of knocking came from the door. Everyone in the room was instantly on alert, and their previous exhaustionand sluggishness was swept away at once as they each readied their own weapons. The population at the border was scarce, and it was extremely bleak and desolate. They were the only team that was permanently stationed in the town to guard the border, and those on patrol outside wouldn’t return so fast. The few remaining residents even more so wouldn’t come out seeking death in the middle of the night to stroll around. Nobody answered from inside the room. After a long pause, there were two more raps on the door. Lu Liu said severely, “Who is it!” Suddenly, a cold wind blew across, extinguishing the oil lamp and the candles on the table. The room was instantly plunged into pitch darkness, leaving only the dim red light of the coals in the stove to burn faintly. The shadow of a man carrying a sword on his back reflected against the paper window of the door. The person said in a loud and clear voice, “Brother Liu, it’s me. It was too cold today, so I came back first. Let me in quickly so I can drink a cup of wine to warm myself up.” All the other people let out the breaths they were holding and berated him. “Do you want to die, Old Qin? Just knocking on the door without saying anythingif we didn’t know better we would’ve thought that you were eaten by a ghost!” The person outside the door chuckled. Lu Liu felt that something wasn’t quite right but couldn’t pinpoint just what it was, so he said, “Come on in!” and opened the door. A gust of cold wind blew directly in from outside. It was completely empty. Lu Liu slammed the door shut. “Light the lamp! Light the lamp, light the lamp!” The newcomer turned and struck up a flame with his slightly shaking fingers, and the trembling light of the fire cast their shadows. He hadn’t lit the candle yet before he turned around again. He stuttered, “Brother Liu, I… I want to ask you something.” Lu Liu said impatiently, “What are you wasting time for?” The newcomer said, “There were only six people in this room before, right? “But when I look around now, why … does it seem like there are seven?” Dead silence.Suddenly, there was an explosion of noise. It was unclear who moved first, but the sound of screaming and weapons clashing against each other mixed together, high and low. Lu Liu shouted, “Light! Light!” Everyone hastily created flames, but their movements were too chaotic, and the flames swayed wildly as their shadows shook violently, swaying to the point that it made their eyes dizzy. The more light there was, the less they were able to discern who was who. Everyone was afraid of hurting someone on their side, so they didn’t dare to act ruthlessly, allowing the thing that had wormed its way in to reap the benefits from their confusion. There was a claw here, a knife there, and Lu Liu was currently resenting everything when something suddenly gripped his neck. His eyes rolled upwards as his feet slowly left the ground, unable to see what was choking him. Just when he thought that his life would end right then and there, the door abruptly burst open and a fierce wind rolled in. A human figure rushed inside. Without seeing him make any particular movements, Lu Liu heard a strange shriek next to his ear, which seemed to come from the thing that was choking him. Afterward, its grip around his throat loosened. The six people inside the room were still badly shaken, and there were some that were already lying on the ground. The person snapped, and all the oil lamps inside the room lit up at the same time. He bent down to inspect the ones on the floor for a moment before standing up and saying, “Unharmed. They just fainted.” This person was covered in black mud, and he looked exactly as if he had just crawled out of a grave. Furthermore, his face was covered with a beard, densely concealing his features. His figure was clearly thin, but his face made it seem as if he was a big burly man with sideburns. Lu Liu finally managed to stop coughing, and he looked him up and down for a moment before he cupped his hands and said, “Many  many thanks to Your Excellency for chasing away that demon just now!” The person placed a hand on his shoulder. “I have something I wish to ask.” Lu Liu, “Please do.” The other said, “What year is it now?” When Shen Qingqiu rolled and crawled down from the mountain, covered completely in mud, he really wanted to destroy Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky ten thousand times over. Destroying his soul, or destroying his backdoor, either was fine.Back then, the life-saving method that he had considered the most was actually faking his death. But what was the point of faking his death? He could find a puppet or someone who looked like him to die in his stead so he could slip away and escape, but the dramas had already overused that trope! So, the method he used was to actually die. That day, he had honestly, genuinely self-destructed, and he had done a good deed on his way out, drawing out a large portion of the out-of-control berserk energy from Luo Binghe’s body. To say that his spiritual veins had been ground into dust wouldn’t even be an overstatement. When faced with death, he could only fight to survive. The Sun and Moon Dew Flower Seed’s nickname “Flesh Seed” represented its literal meaning. Even though this seed wasn’t much use for cultivating, it was still grown from the synthesis of the spiritual energy from the world and the essence of the sun and moon. If its seedling was planted and cultivated in a place abundant with spiritual energy, meticulously molded and vigorously watered, it would be able to grow a living human body by the time it matured. Though the human body could be grown, there was no way to create a soul using this method. In other words, what was grown was a soulless, empty shell, and it couldn’t be any more suited to be a vessel. It was no longer just a dream to “plant a small Shen in the spring and reap a big Shen in the fall”! But it wasn’t as if the Dew Flower Seed was a big white cabbage that could be raised if you just sprinkled some fertilizer on it. Shen Qingqiu had ruined several Flesh Seed sprouts before he finally grew one that wasn’t crooked. He and Shang Qinghua had calculated various coordinates well in advance and implemented remote operations. They set up a transportation array underneath Huayue City’s tallest building, and when the sunlight was at its strongest, Shang Qinghua set up a propelling array at Cang Qiong Mountain. Once Shen Qingqiu’s soul left its body, he would be transported to the matured Dew Seed that they had long since buried deep in the mountains at the border. Three locations, three arrays. When they were connected, they would form the most stable equilateral triangle shape. It should’ve been completely stable, completely reliable. The only flaw rested with a certain someone. Great God Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky was much too reliable.Even though the mistakes Shen Qingqiu was worried about happening didn’t occur, like ‘his arms and legs didn’t finish growing’ or ‘a key part of his body forgot to grow,’ a Sun and Moon Dew Flower Seed that had been forced to ripen too early using chemical fertilizer indeed had some side effects. When he first woke up, Shen Qingqiu waited quietly for a while, but he didn’t hear that abominable Google Translate beep. His heart went wild with joy: The System didn’t come out, hahaha the System didn’t come out! I changed my hardware, I’m not going to install your virus software again hahaha! Even though he was only temporarily set at ease, he still couldn’t help but dance for joy… dance for joy, his ass. His whole body was still buried in the mud, unable to move! He was buried for a whole day, storing up strength first from his fingers all the way up to the point that he could control his limbs. Only then did Shen Qingqiu climb out shakily. The moment he broke free from the dirt, he had yet to revel in the pure and fresh air of freedom before he fell down face-first. Ah, his body wasn’t listening to him again. He laid on the ground. For an entire day, he did warm-up exercises as he walked, and only then did Shen Qingqiu’s walking posture seem like that of a normal person by the time it was night. At any rate, he was no longer walking with the same arm and foot forward anymore. He based this body on the appearance that he, Shen Yuan, originally had in his past life. It wasn’t as good as Shen Qingqiu’s immortal demeanor, but it could still be considered a pretty good body. The only thing was that it gave off a bit of a dispirited feeling like he was a pretty boy sitting around waiting to die. But because they had used a bit of his blood when they were raising the Dew Seed, it would still have some effect no matter what. When Shen Qingqiu rolled to the edge of the stream and used the sharp edge of a rock to shave his beard and take a look, this face still looked thirty-to-forty percent similar to Shen Qingqiu’s. He silently picked up the beard again and stuck it back on his face. After that, he finally managed to get down the mountain and grab someone on the side of the road to askholy shit, five years had already passed! He could understand that the reason his body was uncoordinated or occasionally wouldn’t move when he first woke up was because it needed a certain amount of time to adapt and reconfigure itself, but to be buried for five years before waking uphow did that happen? He had complaint after complaint, but in the end, this body… was simplyoverflowing with spiritual energy! If the original Shen Qingqiu’s body didn’t have Without A Cure occasionally causing trouble, then it could also be considered as having abundant spiritual energy. The only thing was that if he compared it to the feeling he had now, it would be like comparing two bars of battery (still enough to use) to a full bar of battery (just unplugged after it had finished charging). Or, in other words, he could just be called a generator! Could this be considered casting off one’s old self and completely remolding it? Was this a sign that his life as a protagonist was also about to begin? After many years, this was the first time that Shen Qingqiu felt like he had gained a little bit of dignity as a reincarnator, the first time he felt like the incompetent him was no longer dragging down the long line of seniors who had reincarnated before him! When he refocused again, Lu Liu was still talking endlessly. “The problem of the demon race invading these past few years has become more and more serious. All kinds of monsters have come pouring into the human realm, and I’m afraid that a huge battle is about… oh, I still haven’t asked for Your Excellency’s name?” Shen Qingqiu’s ‘haha I am Shen Qingqiu of the Xiu Ya sword from the Central Plains’ Cang Qiong Mountain sect’s Qing Jing Peak’ didn’t even reach his throat before it made a sharp u-turn. Close call, close call, he almost used his old name. He momentarily couldn’t think of another name, and he hesitated for a second before resolutely spitting out two words, “Peerless Cucumber.” His past vanished like smoke. From today onwards, he would walk off the beaten path, and he would use this ID that had swept through book review sites for countless years. After he finished speaking, Shen Qingqiu glided away, leaving behind a room full of frozen people. A long pause later, the newcomer murmured, “Did he just say… Peerless… what was it?” Lu Liu guessed, “Peerless… Chrysanthemum 155 ?” “Wasn’t it Peerless Crown 156 ?” “No no no, it seems like it was Peerless Wild Flower 157 !” Shen Qingqiu had walked several meters away when his feet nearly slipped out from under him. Perhaps he should rethink it later and change it to a different name…Naturally, the first step towards the start of his new life had to begin with the item that Shen Qingqiu was the most familiar with. The first prop he needed was a folding fan. A fan with a white silk base and an ink-splashed landscape on it. Shen Qingqiu opened the fan with a swish, fanning it in front of his chest, sending his long hair and beard flying. He probably didn’t look very good, as he didn’t really match his prop, but it didn’t matter. With a folding fan in his hand, he now had the tool he needed to seem pretentious. Shen Qingqiu placed one foot on the mountain rock and said, “Spill it. What exactly are your intentions for sneaking into the human world?”"
"折扇。 一把白底绢面、泼墨山水的折扇。 沈清秋刷地展扇而开 , 摇在胸前，长发共胡须齐飞。 形象不是很好，与道具略违和，不过没关系。 折扇一把在手 , 装 b 利器我有。 沈清秋一脚踩上山石，道： “ 说吧。你们潜入人界，究竟意图何为？ ” 他面前瑟瑟挤着一堆人 , 啊不 , 是魔。虽说这这两者单从外表看，基本是没有区别的。 最前面那个战战兢兢道： “ 额们平时也就 …… 偷点人界的小玩意儿 , 拿回去换点东西。 ” 魔族没有统一货币 , 多进行物物交换 , 看对眼就换 , 不对眼拉倒。就魔族那种手工水平和艺术 品位，一件普通的刺绣，对他们而言都算是上等工艺品。所以人界的各种玩意儿，其实在 他们那边很受欢迎。而最不值钱的，则是魔界烂大街的各种特效晶石。 但是在魔族烂大街，不代表在人界没有市场！ 沈清秋啪的合扇，肃然道： “ 这穷乡僻野，鸟不拉屎鸡不生蛋的鬼地方，生产水平落后， 经济不发达，人民幸福指数普遍低于平均水准。你们还来趁火打劫，实属不该。 ” 小魔心头大惑。 他怎么记得被抓住的时候，这位 …… 高人也正在偷 …… 啊不是，借衣服穿？ 还有这把扇得正欢的折扇也是。 沈清秋心道，我这也是迫不得已  总不能要他继续穿着土里刨来衣服野人一样到处晃 吧？ 不过，这倒开拓了他的思路。要是能给这些以往只敢偷鸡摸狗的小魔提供正当小商品渠道 ，说不定可以在这个修真打怪为主的世界里，开辟一片种田发家致富流的新天地呢？ 沈清秋自己无责任 yy 一番，觉得如果要收小弟，那就要了解一下双方生活习惯。他和颜悦 色道： “ 你们吃腐肉吗？ ” 众小魔齐齐摇头。沈清秋正要松一口气，就听为首那小魔声情并茂道： “ 额爹说了，腐肉 那是大户人家才吃得起的 ……” 沈清秋： “ 够了。 ” 根本不是经济水平问题好吗！洛冰河魔界上位后够大户了吧？怎么没见他爱吃这种东西！ 顿了顿，他换了个问题： “ 你叫什么名字？ ” 第一个答道： “ 六个球。 ” 沈清秋： “ 什么意思？ ” 六个球道： “ 因为额出生的时候，额爹抱了抱，说有六个球那么重。 ” 沈清秋： “……” 什么球？铅球还是乒乓球？！完全没有意义啊这种名字【。 余下争先恐后报了自己的名字，一个比一个不忍听，偏偏他们还仿佛很以此为荣。 是不是魔族的平民取名都是这种实用主义风格！ 魔族不存在姓氏文化，取名极其天马行空，大胆奔放。那些一看就从 * 丝阶层爬上来的武 将，比如天锤长老，或者独臂长老，称号就非常令人无语。但是如果出身贵族，比如漠北 君，纱华铃，或者洛冰河他爹天琅君，名字情况就稍微好一点。 沈清秋忽然想到，幸好洛冰河不是被扔到魔界被捡到的啊，要是给魔族平民收养了，按照 这种风格，指不定要取什么看起来像爹妈跟他有仇的名字呢。 该叫他什么？ 封面脸？ 不不不，应该有更石破天惊的。记得原著哪个妹子娇羞地表示过，洛冰河那方面很那啥。 后宫三千夜御无数，随便在哪儿都能来一发，千百年下来还能金枪不倒雄健如初，其实， 绝世黄瓜这个名号也挺适合洛冰河的。不过既然已经被他占用了，那洛冰河不如就叫 …… 天柱？ 哈哈哈卧槽洛天柱哈哈哈哈哈哈好酸爽！ 沈清秋刚笑了一阵，突然呼了自己一巴掌。 你特么有病！ 拿主角脑内凑低俗的黄色笑话！ 有什么好笑的。搞清楚应该猥琐的对象了吗？！ 众小魔见这位高人一会儿笑一会儿怒而自扇，云里雾里，大气也不敢出。忽然，沈清秋笑 容戛然而止，扇子压上六个球肩头，把他搭了过来。 沈清秋从他腰间摘下一枚剑穗： “ 这你是从哪儿弄来的？ ” 这是一只剑穗，可不是普通的剑穗。 这可是第一女主角柳溟烟佩剑水色的剑穗！ 男女主定情之物懂吗？当初在苍穹山派的时候沈清秋还特地留意过，辨识度不要太高。 这东西怎么会流落到一个边境小魔的手里？ 六个球惶恐道： “ 这 …… 这个不是偷的，这个是捡的 ……” 你随便上街去再给我捡一个看看。沈清秋道： “ 在哪儿捡的？ ” 六个球道： “ 这 …… 这些天来，夜晚里都有大人物占道，之前会派手下来开道，我们几个 有点好奇，就藏在路旁，之后就在路上捡到了这个。 ” 大人物？ 小魔口里的大人物，必然是魔界的上等人物。 这种角色一般不会频繁地出入边境之地，引人注目，实际上这边的水土通常也不适合他 们。究竟是哪位大人物能够大摇大摆地占道，并且还遗落了柳溟烟的随身之物呢？ 沈清秋想到的第一种可能，当然就是某人。 他问道： “ 你们说的大人物，是不是一个 …… 长得不错的青年？ ” 想了想，他还是决定不要昧着良心了，改口道： “ 不是长得不错，是长得很好、特别好。 ” 六个球摇摇头，忽然脸红了。 你脸红个啥？ 沈清秋盘问一番，问不出东西了，心里琢磨。 应该不是洛冰河。 洛冰河有心魔剑，这就是个丧心病狂的逆天巨挂，随手一斩就能劈裂两界空间，给自己一 划，扒拉个口子就能钻进去到魔界了，从来不会费这么多力，还巴巴地跑到边境之地规规 矩矩走偷渡者的路线。 那么，问题就来了。魔族经过之地，却留下了柳溟烟的东西，难道柳溟烟失手被擒了？ 他可不记得作为第一女主角的柳溟烟原文受过这待遇。哪个狗蛋的小喽敢碰洛冰河他老 婆？ 柳氏兄妹虽说平时在各自峰上各修各的，但原文提过感情很不错，可能只是因为两人都不 是爱黏黏糊糊的类型，这才显得仿佛兄妹之情平平淡淡。但不管柳溟烟作为柳清歌的妹妹 ，还是齐清萋的爱徒，都不能撒手不管。此时，系统（应该）已经（暂时）不能威胁到他 ，也不怕再受限制，狂扣 b 格什么的。 要不是还是去看看？ 沈清秋道： “ 交界的破口在哪里？ ” 子夜时分，沈清秋伏在树梢，藏住一切痕迹，俯视下方。 不止等了多久，某片空气忽然一阵扭曲，肉眼可见的异常起来。 沈清秋眼睛一亮，屏气凝神，只见一个黑衣少年跑了出来。 他们相距甚远，但沈清秋眼神极锐，看得真切。这少年约莫十七八岁年纪，神色紧绷，是 个锐利的俊朗相貌。这张脸沈清秋居然很有几分眼熟，就是想不起来在哪里见过  但他 肯定自己是见过的！ 忽然，寂夜中传出一个清脆的女声，娇滴滴又凉飕飕的，回荡在林中： “ 百战峰座下果然 了得，百道捆仙索缚身，也能打趴我众多属下逃这么久。果然是片刻都懈怠不得！ ” 一听这声音，沈清秋便恍然大悟了。 美貌并且身份高贵、有属下，小魔一提起来就会脸红的魔族  原来是纱华铃！ 对不起，这妹子好歹是女主角之一，不过太久没刷存在感，都忘得差不多了！ 那柳溟烟要是落到她手里，下场更是令人担忧。划花整张脸都是轻的。 难怪刚才觉得这少年奔跑姿势不对，而且身躯略显沉重。沈清秋刚才光看脸了，现在顺着 往下看，原来是数道极细的银丝缠在他身上。看服色，果然是百战峰的人，不过似乎没在 百战峰见过这么年轻的弟子。 这少年知道比快是比不过的对方，猛地刹步，眉间烈气横生： “ 要打便打！ ” 红纱一闪，纱华铃腰肢漫摆，现出身形，盈盈笑道： “ 我好不容易才抓住你的，怎么舍得 打你呀？快快，跟我回去吧？ ” 这少年脾气暴烈，呸了一声。纱华铃道： “ 不肯？虽然我不会损你灵体，可切下个胳膊腿 儿什么的，倒也不碍着用。 ” 她说着就探出右手去抓那少年，可还没碰到，忽然从指间传来极其诡异的震感。 纱华铃以为中了这少年阴招，忙不迭撤回，举手一看，五个涂满艳红丹蔻的指甲，齐齐被 切去了一截。 虽然只是指甲，半点不痛，可纱华铃顿感毛骨悚然。 她厉声喝道： “ 是谁？！ ” 如果这里还有个人，能轻而易举切断她指甲，那么要切她的脖子，也绝对毫不费力。 沈清秋心中舒服多了，把拔光了叶子的小树枝放了回去。 他其实就想吓吓纱华铃，顺便，指甲留那么长不好，真的，每次看到都担心要折掉，极其 难受。而且经常把洛冰河背后抓的血肉模糊 …… 就算向天打飞机菊苣喜欢这种重口调调， 就算洛冰河恢复能力不是人，不代表这是一种健康阳光的生活习惯对不对，他这也算是做 好事对不对？！ 纱华铃杀心顿起，红纱翻卷，卷出一团凛凛魔气，裹在五爪间，披头朝那少年罩去。这姑 娘没被吓怂，反而被吓上了火气，也真是个人物，沈清秋无奈，从树梢间一跃而下，空降 两人之间，单手聚力，打出一记暴击，正正对上纱华铃。 他知道这个身体灵力爆棚，可没想到爆到这个程度。两人双掌还没交接，纱华铃就像一块 被排斥的磁铁，直挺挺倒飞了出去，顺便那身清凉的衣服又裂了 …… 虽然是福利，可沈清秋向来坚持 “ 不看这个世界任何脸在平均水准之上女人的福利 ” 的原则 ，自觉打上马赛克。纱华铃也够干脆，上次还要放句狠话，这次掂量实力，连句场面台词 也不说了，直接就地打滚，滚进了那片扭曲的空气中，身形顿时消匿。 沈清秋把扇子在手中抛了个来回，望上灌注灵力，化扇为刃，反手一切，捆仙索断成百十 截。少年有模有样一抱拳，道： “ 多谢前辈相救！ ” 沈清秋道： “ 你是百战峰弟子？ ” “ 正是。 ” “ 谁座下？ ” “ 家师百战峰峰主，柳清歌。 ” 沈清秋瞪大了眼睛。 柳清歌从来不收徒弟。他那百战峰上，最多的是和他平辈的人，再不就是平辈师兄弟收的 弟子，他本人则没这个兴味教徒弟。虽说百战峰所谓的教徒弟，也只是揍那个人格外多一 些而已 …… 沈清秋略有些怀疑： “ 你叫什么名字？ ” 这少年响亮地答道： “ 杨一玄。 ” 我就说眼熟肯定在哪里见过吧？！ 之前是忘记已经过去五年了，五年足够一个小孩儿长开长大了。沈清秋上下打量杨一玄， 无限感慨。柳清歌居然真的收他做徒弟了啊。 杨一玄道： “ 前辈？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 你师父 …… 这几年怎么样？ ” 上次最后花月城一见，多少还是坑了他一把。沈清秋觉得必须关心一下师弟近况。 杨一玄道： “ 屡战屡败。 ” 沈清秋： “……” 屡战屡败这个词跟百战峰峰主扯上关系，真不是一般的毁三观！ 沈清秋道： “ 他跟谁打？洛冰河？ ” 杨一玄哼道： “ 除了那小畜生还能有谁？ ” 沈清秋脸色微微扭曲。杨一玄自己比洛冰河都要小不少，也跟着叫 “ 小畜生 ” ，这都是跟谁 学的。 他却不知道，现在整个苍穹山派，提到洛冰河，不是 “ 小畜生 ” ，就是 “ 魔族孽障 ” ，再不就 是“ 白眼狼 ” ，直呼其名加个 “ 这厮 ” 都算是客气的了。 杨一玄好奇道： “ 前辈与家师可是相熟？ ” 沈清秋咳了一声： “ 都是过去的事了 …… 我听她刚才说话有点奇怪。什么叫 ‘ 我怎么舍 得’ ？ ” 杨一玄立刻涨红了脸。 沈清秋道： “ 看不出来啊？你是怎么被她抓住的？ ” 杨一玄憋气道： “ 如果不是这妖女使奸诈手段，先扮作落难女子，被我怀疑后又突然脱 …… 脱 …… 我绝对不会中圈套。 ” 沈清秋教育道： “ 你看你，还像百战峰出来的吗？不近女色，不是畏惧女色。脱衣服算什 么？一个姑娘当着你脱衣服算什么？你师父当年去打魅妖，整个洞里都是没穿衣服的！ ” 当然，当时他在旁边，也有怀疑过柳清歌是不是 x 冷淡或者生理问题也就是了 …… 言归正传。纱华铃不止抓了杨一玄，多半也抓了柳溟烟，这么大张旗鼓地擒拿苍穹山派弟 子，看来，只能是一个缘故了。 洛冰河出问题了。","CHAPTER 45: DEMON CULTURE A pile of trembling people were squeezed in front of him… ah no, not people, they were demons. Although, just by looking at their appearance, there wasn’t much of a difference. The one in front shook with fear. “We usually just… steal some small trinkets from the human world and take it back to exchange for some things.” The demonic race didn’t have a common currency and mostly bartered. If something looked pleasing to the eye then they’d exchange for itif not, then they would leave it. As for the demon race’s level of craftsmanship and art, a piece of ordinary embroidery was equivalent to high-quality handiwork, so the various little trinkets of the human world were enthusiastically received. The things of least value were the various special crystals that were thought to be tacky and omnipresent in the demon world. But what the demon world considered tacky and omnipresent was well received in the human world! Shen Qingqiu snapped closed his fan. He said seriously, “This poor, remote, godforsaken place, producing ability is backward, the economy is not flourishing, and the people’s happiness is lower than the average level. Despite this, you take advantage of others’ misfortune and commit thieverytruly, this is something that should not be done.” The little demon was greatly confused. How come he remembered when he was captured, this… great person was also in the middle of stealing… ah no, borrowing some clothes to wear? And this folding fan that was happily waved around was the same. Shen Qingqiu thought, I was forced by the circumstancessurely he should not have to keep wearing clothes dug from the ground, wandering around like a savage? But this opened up a new avenue of thought. If you can give the little demons, previously only petty thieves, a means to acquire these small goods, could this possibly set up a prosperous and peaceful farming community, giving them new ground in a society based around cultivators fighting demons? Shen Qingqiu, like an irresponsible YY novel character, thought that if he were to take some underlings under his wing, then he must first understand the opposing side’s life. He asked amiably, “Do you eat rotten flesh?” All the little demons shook their heads. Shen Qingqiu was just about to give a relieved sigh when he heard the leading little demon say resoundingly,“My father said only rich people can afford to eat rotten meat…” Shen Qingqiu interrupted. “Enough.” It’s hardly an economic question, ok! Luo Binghe, after he ascended to his position in the demon world, is enough of a big person, right? How come he’s never seen him enjoy eating this type of thing! A pause. He changed the question. “What is your name?” The first one replied, “Six Balls.” Shen Qingqiu asked, “What does that mean?” Six Balls said, “When I was born, my father held me and said I weighed six balls.” Shen Qingqiu: “…” What kind of ball? Shot-put or ping-pong ball? This kind of name is completely senseless. The rest of them fought to not be the last to announce their name. None of them could endure being the last heard. It seemed they regarded this as quite an honor. Are all the names given to ordinary demons of this practical/pragmatic type! Family names didn’t exist in demon culture and the names they chose were incredibly unrestrained and imaginative, brazen and bold. Those generals whose titles render people speechlessfor example, the Sky Hammer Elder or Single-Arm Elderanyone could tell that they’d climbed there from loser stage in a glance. But if born a noblefor example, Mo Bei-Jun, Sha Hualing, or Luo Binghe’s father Tian Lang-Juntheir situation was slightly better. Shen Qingqiu suddenly had a thought. It was fortunate Luo Binghe hadn’t been thrown into the demon world and adopted from there. If he were raised by ordinary folk of the demon race, according to this style, he would probably be given a name that seemed as if his parents bore him a grudge. What would he be called? Jade Face Little Lang-Jun? No, no, no, it should probably be more impressivethunderous to crack stones and startle the heavens. Remembering in the original work that a young lady had shyly expressed how Luo Binghe in “that respect” is so etc. The harem 3000 nights… even after a thousand centuries the golden spear didn’t fall and remained robust as ever. In fact, the name Peerless Cucumber suited Luo Binghe quite well, but since Shen Qingqiu was already using it, then Luo Binghe might as well be called… Heavenly-Pillar Lord?Hahaha, holy fuck, Luo Heavenly Pillar hahahahahaha how sick but invigorating! Shen Qingqiu had just begun laughing when he suddenly gave himself a slap. You’re fucking crazy! Are you really so pleased with yourself that you start thinking vulgar jokes in your head? What is there to laugh about? Did you figure out who you should be making wretched? All the little demons, who saw this great person laugh until he fell to the ground and furiously slap himself in the next moment, were in a puzzled fog, but they didn’t even dare breathe. Suddenly, Shen Qingqiu’s smile froze. His fan pressed down on Six Ball’s shoulders and pulled him over. Shen Qingqiu took a sword tassel from his waist. “Where’d you get this from?” This was a sword tassel, but it wasn’t an ordinary tassel. This is the primary female protagonist Liu Mingyan’s sword Shui Se’s sword tassel! This is the male and female protagonist’s token of love, do you understand? Back then, at Cang Qiong Mountain, Shen Qingqiu had paid special attention to itthere didn’t need to be a lot of distinguishing features for him to recognize it. How did this thing end up in this random little demon’s hands? Six Balls whimpered, “Th-th-this isn’t stolen, this was picked up…” You go to a random street and pick up another tassel again for me to see. Shen Qingqiu asked, “Where did you find it?” Six Balls said, “Th-th-these past days, there are great people occupying the road at night, ordering their subordinates to come and clear the way. We were a bit curious, so we hid next to the road, and picked this up off the road afterward.” The great people the little demon spoke of were, without a doubt, the demon society’s nobles. This type usually wouldn’t appear much in frontier zones, thus catching the attention of many people. Rather, the environment here usually didn’t suit them. What kind of important person would have the audacity to parade around and occupy the road, even leaving behind Liu Mingyan’s item that’s always kept close to her? The first person Shen Qingqiu thought of was, naturally, a certainsomeone. He asked, “The great person you speak of, is it… a not bad-looking youth?” After a moment of thinking, he decided against concealing his thoughts, changed tactics, and said, “He isn’t just not bad-looking, he’s really quite attractive. Very attractive. White skin, charming face, tall, doesn’t smile much, but when he does it is quite dark.” Six Balls shook his head, his face suddenly reddening. What is he blushing for? Shen Qingqiu interrogated him further, but couldn’t get a word out of him. He mulled it over and thought it probably wasn’t Luo Binghe. Luo Binghe had the Heart Demon sword, which was an OP item defied the natural order, could at will slash apart the space between the two worlds, and, with just a slash, flick aside an opening to step into the demon world. He would never use up this much energy to run over to this remote area and dutifully walk the smuggler’s road instead. In that case, questions arise. If the demon sect passed through this area and left behind Liu Mingyan’s things, could it be that Liu MingYan slipped up and was captured? He couldn’t remember a moment in the original work where the primary female protagonist Liu Mingyan was subject to this treatment. What kind of rustic little bandit dared to touch Luo Binghe’s wife? Though the Liu brother and sister pair usually stayed in their respective Peaks and cultivated independently, the original work mentioned they had a good relationship with each other. It was probably because neither of them were the clingy type that it seemed the brother-sister relationship was distant. But no matter if it was Liu Qingge’s little sister or Qi Qingqi’s beloved disciple, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t ignore Liu Mingyan and not interfere. Moreover, at this time, the system was (or should be) unable to threaten him (for now). He also didn’t need to fear limitations or a flurry of deducting B points etc. Why not go over and have a look? Shen Qingqiu asked, “The break/fissure between worldswhere is it?” At midnight, Shen Qingqiu hid in the treetops, concealed all traces of his presence, and watched below. He didn’t know how long he waited when a patch of air suddenly became distorted enough for the naked eye to see. Shen Qingqiu’s eyes lit up as he held his breath, attentive. He saw only asingle black-robed youth leap out. The distance between them was quite far, but Shen Qingqiu’s eyes were exceptionally keen and saw him clearly. This youth was approximately seventeen years old, a strained expression upon his sharp, handsome face. Shen Qingqiu was quite familiar with this face, but he just couldn’t recall where he’d seen it beforehe was, regardless, sure he’d seen it before. Suddenly, the silence of the night was broken by a ringing female voice, sweet and cold, echoing in the forest. “As expected, Bai Zhan Peak’s disciples are exceptionala hundred Immortal Binding Cables tied around the body, yet still able to beat my numerous subordinates to the ground and escape for this long. There really is not a single moment of laziness!” Upon hearing this voice, Shen Qingqiu suddenly realized something. Beautiful, noble, had subordinates, a demon who little demons would blush upon mentioningso it’s Sha Hualing. Apologies, this girl is one of the female protagonists. With that said, it’s been too long since we were reminded of her existence and more or less forgot about her! If Liu Mingyan fell into her handswhat happened next would make people even more concerned. His face paled. No wonder this youth’s running posture wasn’t right, like his body was particularly heavy. Shen Qingqiu had only looked at his face, but now that he moved his gaze down, he could see that there were numerous thin silver strands wound around his body. Seeing the color of his robes, he could tell he was someone from Bai Zhan Peak, but he had no impression of seeing such a young disciple at Bai Zhan Peak before. This youth knew he couldn’t outrun his opponent and suddenly halted, intensity streaming from his forehead. “If you want to fight then fight!” A flash of red cloth, Sha Hualing sauntered over with swaying hips, emphasizing her figure. With a full-bodied laugh, she said, “I spent so much effort catching you, how could I fight you? Quick, why don’t you just come back with me?” This youth’s temper was explosive, and he spat in contempt. Sha Hualing said, “Not willing? Though I won’t harm your soul, chopping off an arm or leg or something wouldn’t affect your usability.” Saying this, she stretched out her right hand to grab that youth but hadn’t been able to make contact. From her fingertips, she felt an unusual tremor. Sha Hualing thought the youth retaliated, retrieved her hand in haste, raised it tolook, and saw that her five painted scarlet fingernails were cut off to a shorter length. Though it was just the fingernails and didn’t hurt at all, Sha Hualing still felt her hair-raising. She shouted, “Who’s there?” If there was someone else here who could effortlessly sever her fingernail, then they could effortlessly sever her neck. Shen Qingqiu, content, returned the tree branch leaves to their original place. He just wanted to scare Sha Hualing, but at the same time, letting her nails grow so long was no good, really. Every time he sees it he would worry it’ll break, which made him feel awful. Also, it would frequently rake Luo Binghe’s back to the point of making it bleed… Even if Airplane Shooting Towards The Sky enjoyed this kind of hardcore thing, even if Luo Binghe’s rejuvenation ability was inhumanit didn’t mean it was a proper and healthy way of living, right? Sha Hualing’s killing intent rose, swirling her red sash, and a ball of imposing demonic energy gathered around her five claws, which was then sent flying over to smother that youth. This young lady wasn’t scared stiff; conversely, she was scared angry. She really was a character. Shen Qingqiu, helpless, leaped down from the treetops, appearing to drop out of thin air between the two people. He gathered strength in a single hand and released a sudden assault that collided with Sha Hualing. He knew this body’s spiritual energy was full to bursting but didn’t think it was full to this degree. Their two palms had not yet made contact when Sha Hualing was sent flying away as if she was a repelled magnetat the same time, those clothes that barely covered her once again ripped apart… Though it was a bonus, Shen Qingqiu always insisted on following a “don’t look at a woman who has an above average face in this world” doctrine, so he conscientiously pixelated her himself. Sha Hualing was direct: last time she was about to let loose ruthless wordsthis time she just measured her strength and, not speaking a single line for the occasion, skipped straight to roll away, rolled right into that distorted air, and vanished in an instant. Shen Qingqiu tossed his fan back and forth between his hands, infused spiritual energy, and transformed the fan into a blade. With a flip of a hand he chopped, and the Immortal Binding Cable broke into a hundred or so pieces. The youth, with great form and decorum, cupped his fists respectfully said, “Many thanks to senior for saving me!”Shen Qingqiu, also with form and decorum, asked, “You are a Bai Zhan Peak disciple?” “That is correct.” “Under who?” “My master is the Bai Zhan Peak Lord, Liu Qingge.” Shen Qingqiu was astounded. Liu Qingge never took disciples. At his Bai Zhan Peak, there were, at most, only his contemporariesotherwise, there would be the disciples of his contemporaries, but he himself had no interest in teaching disciples. Though Bai Zhan Peak claims to teach, they really just pick on people… Shen Qingqiu was suspicious. “What’s your name?” That youth answered clearly, “Yang Yixuan.” I was saying he looked familiar so I must have met him somewhere before, right? Five years was more than enough for a child to grow up. Shen Qingqiu gave Yang Yixuan an evaluating glance up and down. Yang Yixuan said, “Elder?” Shen Qingqiu inquired, “Your Shizunhow has he been these past few years?” Losing to Luo Binghe at Hua Yue City would have been quite a blow for Liu Qingge. Shen Qingqiu felt a duty to ask after his Shidi’s situation. Yang Yixuan answered sincerely, “Defeated in every battle.” Shen Qingqiu: “…” “Defeated in every battle”these words became associated with the Bai Zhan Peak Lord. It truly made one’s courage fail. Shen Qingqiu asked, “Who is he fighting against? Luo Binghe?” Yang Yixuan groused, “Apart from that little bastard, who else could it be?” Shen Qingqiu’s expression faintly twisted. Yang Yixuan himself was much younger than Luo Binghe, but called him a “little bastard” Who did he learn this from? He doesn’t know, but the entire Cang Qiong Mountain sect had taken to calling Luo Bingheif not “little bastard”“evil demon” “white-eyed wolf 158 ,” or addressed him without his honorific title. Calling him a “bastard” was considered to be courteous. Shen Qingqiu said, “How did you fall into this witch’s hands? I heard what she just said and thought it was strange. What does ‘how could I’ mean?”Yang Yixuan promptly flushed. “If not for this witch using treacherous methodsfirst pretending to be a lady in distress, and after I became skeptical she all of a sudden took… took off… I’d never be trapped and caught by her!” He understood in a flash. Shen Qingqiu lectured, “Look at yourself. Do you look like someone from Bai Zhan Peak? Even if you don’t interact with women, doesn’t mean you should dread interacting with them. What’s the matter with undressing? What’s the matter with a girl undressing in front of you? Your Shizun, back in the day, fought female demons in an entire cave full of naked ones!” Of course, with that said, when they were together at that time, he was suspicious Liu Qingge was either frigid or had some physiological issues… Yang Yixuan’s entire face was full of longing admiration. “An entire cave? He truly is Shizun!” and followed up with a puzzled question, “Elder is familiar with Master? Otherwise, how could you know that my Shizun fought the female demons?” Shen Qingqiu sighed. “Old affairs, old affairs.” They changed the topic of their conversation to more pressing matters. Sha Hualing not only caught Yang Yixuan, but she most likely also caught Liu Mingyan and brazenly seized Cang Qiong Mountain Peak’s disciplesthere can be only one reason. Something was wrong with Luo Binghe. Luo Binghe’s system of practice is an extremely unscientific system. Born of the demon and human worlds, the two types of energy would normally mutually reject each other when they were in one body. Thus, his spiritual energy and demon energy needed to balance each other. However, the involvement of the Heart Demon sword would make demonic energy surge, disrupt the balance, and cause the energies to no longer work in harmony."
"洛冰河的修炼系统 , 是一个极其不科学的系统。双管齐下，把两种原本会互相排斥的体系 蕴为一体，这样就要求，灵气和魔气必须相互制衡。 但是 , 心魔剑的介入，则恰恰会让魔气大盛，失去平衡，运转不调。 洛冰河为了解决这个问题，采用的办法是找人肉引子。 满月之时 , 寻一灵力强盛者，把体内多余的魔气引渡过去，作为交换 , 再吸取大部分灵气过 来。如此 , 自然就平衡了。 但是，由于洛冰河魔气太过霸道，常常导致渡完了气，人也废了。基本上这些引渡容器的 使用限度都只有一次。 这种劳心劳力抓肉引子的事，洛冰河当然不会亲自去办。不用他多说，纱华铃自然会把人 关笼子里了给他随便挑。洛冰河只消在满月之夜，用心魔剑劈开个口子钻到魔界去，直接 拿人来用就行了。 杯具的是，纱华铃费心费力，结果洛冰河却跟她亲自挑选的三名天一观美貌道姑搞上了。 也真是悲惨，可想而知，纱华铃人都快气炸了！ 沈清秋道： “ 你被擒住的时候，有没有看到其他人？都被关在哪儿了？ ” 杨一玄摇头： “ 从两界裂口进去后，就是那妖女的老窝赤云窟。还有其他人也被擒住了 吗？ ” 沈清秋抛了抛那枚剑穗，道： “ 我猜，不止你一个。 ” 他想了想，还是决定去瞧一瞧，反正今夜不是满月，不是引渡之时，洛冰河忙着在人界兴 风作浪挑拨离间，肯定不会来和纱华铃聚头。杨一玄连忙跟上： “ 我也去！我的剑还在那 妖女手里。 ” 沈清秋问他： “ 你不怕她脱衣服了？ ” 杨一玄哼道： “ 我才不是怕。再说，这一路上她都脱了几十回了，还有什么稀罕的。 ” 穿过空间裂口，就像穿过一片正在涌动的温热水流，再出来时，就是魔族的地界了。 人界那边已是子夜过后，而魔族这边，则才是暮色刚刚降临。 空气格外干燥，沈清秋站了一会儿，有点儿头晕，类似高原反应。放眼望去，和人界似乎 并没有什么不同，只是树木要稀少一些。 看来绿化工作做得不太好。 杨一玄带路，穿过嶙峋乱石，很快地找到了赤云窟的入口。久仰魔族建筑文化大名，亲眼 一见，果然是如此的 …… 不同凡响。 魔族性喜阴暗，居所和行宫大多设在地底。这整个入口看上去，像是一座异常华丽的陵 墓。 沈清秋心道，你告诉我，一个大石包前面竖着个石牌子，上面用扭曲的红色字体写着赤云 窟三个字  这不是墓碑是什么？ 他手里扣了一发灵流，随时准备糊可能出现的敌人一脸，从墓道口，不，从入口下去，却 没见到守卫。想想也对，从来只有魔族偷渡到人界作威作福，哪有人类会跑来这边找死的 ，根本没必要安排守卫。 二人潜行深入，穿过石廊，就是一个大厅。 厅中铺满各类奇兽的完整皮毛，乍一看仿佛活物。纱华铃正赤着脚，在大厅地上扑的巨虎 皮上踩来踩去。 沈清秋担心杨一玄出声惊动对方，正要提醒，却见他自觉地紧闭着嘴，便放心地转回身 去。 大厅两侧，分布着数只笼子，笼子里都是被五花大绑的修士们，服色各异。有看上去极年 轻的，也有瞧着老道的，有的昏昏欲睡，有的正怒目而对。 纱华铃走到一只笼子前，抱着手道： “ 你们苍穹山派的人可真是难缠又讨厌！好不容易抓 住两个，还有一个没关进来就跑了。 ” 她咬牙道： “ 要不是、要不是 …… 我真恨不得把你们 腿都打断！ ” 这只笼子里，柳溟烟脸罩面纱，闭目盘坐，仿佛不为外物所动。 纱华铃见她不理自己，冷笑道： “ 你脸上这玩意儿，就从来不摘下来吗？难道是相貌太过 丑陋，自卑所以不敢摘下来？ ” 沈清秋：妹子 …… 你知不知道你将来最嫉妒的是谁？ 说她丑那是妥妥的打你自己的脸啊！ 也许是第六感作祟，纱华铃怎么看柳溟烟怎么不顺眼，打开笼门，把柳溟烟拽了出来，喝 道： “ 跪下！ ” 柳溟烟当然不肯跪，虽然灵力全无，却站的稳稳当当。纱华铃推推搡搡，硬是没法叫她膝 盖弯一下，七窍生烟，一把拽下她脸上面纱。 刹那间，纱华铃雪白的小脸变得更雪白了。 沈清秋心中咆哮：转过来！转过来！我要看！快让我看看本书第一美女究竟长什么样 子！！！ 这些年他自持身份，不能说 “ 你好，师侄，我想看看你的脸，可以吗 ” 这种像是猥琐男性骚 扰的话，一直看不到柳溟烟的脸，真是快憋死了！ 可柳溟烟还没转过脸让他一睹为快，纱华铃眼里就凶光一闪，五指成爪，往柳溟烟脸上抓 去。 比她还好看的容貌、绝对不能被洛冰河看到！ 于是，今晚第二次被震飞的时候，纱华铃终于忍不住，吐了一口憋屈的血。脑子里蓦地闪 过一个自我安慰的念头：好歹这次衣服没破，对吧 …… 沈清秋虽然把她震了出去，但袖子还是被她抓出五道裂口，心中悚然：这指甲不是半个时 辰之前才被他切掉的吗？难不成还可以无限再生！ 他击飞纱华铃，连忙转头去看柳溟烟，一看就脚底一滑。 这么短的时间，她居然就立刻把面纱戴上了。让他看一眼又怎么样？！ 杨一玄已经迅速无比地打开了十几个笼门，用刚找到的剑一一斩断绳索。沈清秋无语。他 真不知道纱华铃抓了这么多，他本来只想把不该出现在这里的柳溟烟救走，这不属于破坏 剧情，反而算是矫正。但杨一玄这样乱放一通，万一把要给洛冰河疏导魔气的三位美女道 姑放走了怎么办？！ 眼看他已经放得差不多了，沈清秋没办法，只得也跟着放起来，谁知，刚打开笼门，对上 一张略微眼熟的脸，心里就咯噔一声。 糟糟糟。果真是冤家路窄。 秋海棠蜷在笼子里，惊疑不定地瞪着他。 沈清秋定了两秒，假装不认识，示意她快出来，又若无其事转过身了。 他现在这个形象，（应该）谁都认不出来。况且五年前可是无数双眼睛都见证了沈清秋当 场自爆的一幕。没什么好心虚的。 纱华铃昏昏沉沉，挣扎着坐起，定睛一看，厉声道： “ 是你？你究竟是谁？居然还敢追过 来，真是好大的胆子！ ” 杨一玄像也忽然想起来这个问题了，一边开笼子一边顺口问了句： “ 对哦，前辈，你是谁 啊？ ” “ 对哦 ” 个鬼！ 反射弧太长了少年！ 而且你这种顺带一问的口气是怎么回事！ 沈清秋正考虑要不要再报一次绝世黄瓜的名号，纱华铃哼笑道： “ 也罢，来了就别想走。 ” 她拍拍手掌，铃音乱颤。片刻之后，大厅四周终于涌入了赤云窟的守卫团。 赤云窟是纱华铃私人府邸，正规打手都不在这里，她手里的虾兵蟹将不足为惧。那些小魔 围着他转来又转去，手臂举上又放下，活像跳大神。沈清秋看得云里雾里，正心情烦躁， 准备一扇子全都扇飞，忽然，感觉周身似乎被无数根头发丝牵制住了， 捆仙索。 这些杂兵虽然战斗力不咋强，但明显是受过训练的。人手一条细如发丝的捆仙索，围着他 绕个不停，把他绕成了一个大线团，缠满捆仙索。 纱华铃还没来得及叫好，只见沈清秋笑了一声，猛一踩地面。空气中传来琴弦崩断之声。 爆了。捆仙索居然被这人用灵力生生冲爆了！ 在场众人多半都惊骇得忘记了手头该做的事。这还真是第一次看见有人能用灵力直接爆断 捆仙索。 真是简单粗暴的破解方法！ 沈清秋喝道： “ 先走！ ” 其他人哪需要他多说，早就走得七七八八了。杨一玄与柳溟烟才挣脱捆仙索不久，灵力运 转尚不稳定，知道留在这里也是拖后腿，再看沈清秋应该应对无碍，留下一句 “ 前辈保重 ” ，便干脆地撤了。众喽见状，不知当追不当追，原地困顿，寻求上级指令。纱华铃眼放 异彩，直指沈清秋，大叫道： “ 抓住他！别人都别管的！就他一个  死也给我把他拖 住！ ” 沈清秋一扇子扇飞朝他扑来几只杂兵： “ 来多少也没用！ ” 在日月露华芝塑养的肉身面前，捆仙索这玩意儿不足为据，绑多少爆多少！ 忽然，头顶似乎有什么东西沉甸甸地压了下来。 一张巨网。 无数根粗如小指的捆仙索交织而成的巨网，劈头盖脸罩了下来。 落到他身上时，光是那份重量，就让沈清秋膝盖一软，险些当场扑街。 哪来的这种逆天道具。每根绳子这么粗你确定是用来捆 “ 仙 ” 不是用来捆大象的吗？！ 纱华铃等了一会儿，见沈清秋这次果然挣不脱了，这才慢慢走了近来，方才的狼狈一扫而 光，咯咯笑道： “ 一百条捆仙索拴不住你，难道我不会用一千条么？这缚仙网原本不是为 你准备的，居然用到了你身上，你也该倍感荣幸了。 ” 做这东西耗资耗时，绝对不是为了对付他准备的，只不过是提前派上了用场。 纱华铃心满意足，觉得自己这回立下大功一桩，连斥责都娇嗔起来： “ 别乱动了！老实呆 着，不会拿你怎么样的。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 不会拿我怎样的话，劳烦能把网子撤走否？ ” 纱华铃不跟他交流，自说自话道： “ 看你天赋异禀，如能归顺我族旗下，权势荣华，唾手 可得。当然，便是你不肯归顺，也没什么。该做的还是得做。 ” 怪不得刚才纱华铃弃旁人不顾，火力专往他身上集中。 感情这丫头是打算把他当人肉引子送给洛冰河呢！！！ 洛冰河需要的是灵力强盛的人，她抓来的那些修士，哪个比他现在灵力还强的？当然懒得 管他们了！ 忽然，纱华铃忙理了理略显凌乱的发丝。 看到她这个举动，沈清秋感觉似乎有一只毛茸茸的生物，顺着他脊背往上爬。 照理说，今天不是满月之夜，他应该不会来才对。 纱华铃一扭身子，朝厅外迎了过去，娇笑道： “ 属下刚刚说过，给您准备的一份大礼，已 经在这儿了。 ” 虽然沈清秋根本没看见来人，可一股热血混着冷汗倒流着冲上了脑门。 不知从哪里涌上来一股爆发力，他揪住网面，将体内源源不绝的灵气以暴击形式送了出 去。 轰炸声。 纱华铃的笑容一下子僵在脸上，慌忙转回去，登时瞠目结舌。 大厅中，赤云窟的属下们都东倒西歪，横七竖八趴了一地。缚仙网中央，一个巨大的破洞 边缘还残留着兹兹乱闪的火星，白烟正缕缕飘散。 这人太可怕了。居然连这张缚仙巨网，也被他生生爆了一个大洞跑了！ 身后那人越过她，缓缓步入厅中。赤云窟阴暗无光，只能看见一道修挺长挑的身影，还有 黑袍暗纹上细微的银色反光。 片刻之后，无喜无怒的声音响起。 “ 这就是你的大礼？ ” 纱华铃恨恨道： “…… 一时失算，让他给跑了！ ” 她心疼得心在滴血。上千条捆仙索织就的缚仙网，原本是拿来有更大的用途的，结果就这 么被轰破了一个大洞。这可不是缝缝补补就能接着用的东西！ 那人背对着她，低头看了一眼地上残骸，一语不发，若有所思。 纱华铃道： “ 这人十分了得，我还从没见过比他灵力更霸气的修士，有他一个，您今后就 再也不需要每月换一个人做容器了。 ” 她咬了咬嘴唇，道： “ 只要您给我 …… 那样东西。 ” 纱华铃等待了片刻，忽的一伸手，接住了抛来的一样事物，牢牢攥在手心。 她大喜过望，道： “ 得您之赐，属下保证，明日满月之时，他必将在您掌控之中！ ” “ 苍穹山派的人， ” 那人道： “ 以后别抓了。 ” 纱华铃撇嘴，应道： “ 遵命。 ” 她原本心中不服气，苍穹山派的弟子灵力普遍要比其他派的弟子高出一截，拿来做引渡容 器最适合不过。可想想，如果能抓住今天那怪人，还要苍穹山派的人干什么？ 对方并未转身，不多留一刻，径自朝外走去，似要直接离开赤云窟。纱华铃愣了愣，想出 声叫他，却又不敢。 他又要去那个地方了。","CHAPTER 46: COMMOTION IN THE DEVIL’S NEST To resolve this issue, Luo Binghe employed a method of using human vessels to draw out the demonic energy. Every month on the full moon, he would seek out someone with strong spiritual energy and transfer the excess demonic energy from his own body out to them. In exchange, he would absorb the greater part of the other’s spiritual energy. Using this method, he would naturally be able to maintain equilibrium. However, because Luo Binghe’s demonic energy was excessively overbearing 159 , the human vessel would be crippled after the energy transfer. Basically, each human extraction vessel could only be used once. Luo Binghe certainly wouldn’t do the demanding work of catching human vessels himself. Without much persuasion, Sha Hualing was, of course, willing to store people in cages for him to pick from as he pleased. On the night of the full moon, Luo Binghe would only need to use the Xin Mo sword to cleave open a passage into the Demon Realm and grab a person to use. The sad thing was, in the original work, Luo Binghe married three of her personally selected female priests from the Tian Yi Monastery after Sha Hualing went through all that trouble. As one can well imagine, Sha Hualing went mad with anger! Shen Qingqiu asked, “Did you see anyone else when you were caught? Where were you held?” Yang Yixuan shook his head. “After we entered the rift between the worlds, we were in the lair of that demon woman, Chi Yun cave. I was shut in a solitary cell and didn’t see anyone else.” Shen Qingqiu tossed Liu Mingyan’s sword tassel and said, “I think it wasn’t you alone who was captured.” He thought a bit and decided it was best to go and take a look. In any case, tonight was not the full moon, not the time for the extraction. Luo Binghe was busy stirring up havoc and sowing dissension in the human realm, so he shouldn’t come looking to meet with Sha Hualing. Shen Qingqiu asked, “You’re not scared she’ll take off her clothes?” Yang Yixuan said disdainfully, “I’m by no means scared. Besides, during this whole journey, she took them off dozens of times. It’s not a rare occurrence anymore.” Shen Qingqiu turned, speechless. Turns out she shut you in a solitary cell so she could strip for you to seethis good fortune is unbelievable. Young man,if you continue along these lines, the male protagonist will absolutely put you to death. It’s so worrying that this is indeed Liu Qingge’s sole disciple! Passing through the rift between worlds felt like passing through a sheet of warm flowing water. After they re-emerged, they were in the territory of the Demon Realm. On the human side, it was already past midnight, but on the demon side, twilight had only just fallen. The air was particularly arid. After standing there for a moment, Shen Qingqiu felt a bit dizzy, like he was suffering from altitude sickness. As far as the eye could see, there seemed to be little difference from the Human Realmonly the trees were a bit more sparse. Looks like the reforestation efforts weren’t going too well. Yang Yixuan led the way. Passing through craggy stones, they quickly found the opening of Chi Yun cave. It’s an honor to see you at last, this cultural landmark of the demon race. Seeing it with one’s own eyes, sure enough, it’s… remarkably uncommon. The demon race had an aesthetic preference for darkness. For the most part, both their permanent and temporary residences were all built underground. The entirety of the entrance appeared to be an exceptionally splendid mausoleum. Shen Qingqiu thought, you’re telling me, a big pile of stone with a stone sign erected in front and three letters in red calligraphy on topwhat is this, a tombstone? He cupped a handful of spiritual energy, ready to roast the face of any enemy who might appear at any time. Yet, descending the tomb passageno, the entrancehe didn’t encounter any guards. Thinking over it, this seemed reasonable. It was always demons stowing away to the human realm to abuse peoplewhat sort of human would run to this side to court death? There was simply no need to arrange a guard. The two slinked into the depths. Passing through stone corridors, they arrived at a large hall. Spread throughout the hall were intact skins of all kinds of strange beasts, appearing to still be alive at first glance. Sha Hualing was currently barefoot, treading on a huge tiger skin spread on the floor of the hall. Shen Qingqiu was worried that Yang Yixuan would recklessly make a sound and alert their opponent. Just as he was about to remind him, he saw that the boy had taken the initiative to shut his mouth securely. Feeling reassured, he turned back around.On both sides of the hall were several cages of trussed cultivators, each wearing differently colored uniforms. Looking around, some were extremely young, some were old, some were drowsily nodding off, and some were glowering with righteous fury. Sha Hualing walked over to one of the cages and said, with her arms crossed, “You Cang Qiong Mountain sect people are truly troublesome and annoying! It was hard enough to capture two of you, and one even escaped before they were put in a cage.” She clenched her teeth and said, “If not for, if not for… I’m really itching to break all your legs!” In this cage, Liu Mingyan sat with closed eyes and crossed legs, a veil covering her face, not reacting to outside disturbances. Sha Hualing saw that she was being ignored and, smiling coldly, said, “That thing on your face, don’t you ever take it off? Oh, I see, don’t tell me your face is just too ugly and you don’t dare take it off because you’re self- conscious?” Shen Qingqiu: Sister… are you aware who you will be most jealous of in the future? Saying she’s ugly is indeed just hitting yourself in the face! Her women’s intuition causing mischief, the more Sha Hualing looked at Liu Mingyan the more unpleasing she looked. Opening the cage, she dragged Liu Mingyan out and yelled, “Kneel!” Liu Mingyan was naturally unwilling to kneel. Though she had no spiritual energy, she still stood firm. Sha Hualing pushed and shoved, but was simply unable to make her knees bend even a little. Spouting smoke through the seven orifices 160 , she hauled off the veil on her face. In that instant, Sha Hualing’s snow-pale face became even more snow- pale. Shen Qingqiu roared internally: Turn around! Turn around! I want to see! Quickly, let me see what sort of appearance the book’s most beautiful woman has! These years, he was careful to maintain his dignified persona and couldn’t say, “Hi, martial niece, I heard you’re very pretty so I want to look at your face. Can I?” This sounded like sexual harassment from a vulgar man. Not being able to see Liu Mingyan’s face this whole timehe was almost stifled to death! But before Liu Mingyan turned and before he could experience the joy of seeing her face for the first time, an ominous glint flashed through Sha Hualing’s eyes. Her five fingers forming a claw, her hand shot towards Liu Mingyan’sface. Consequently, Sha Hualing was shocked when she found herself flying a second time this night. She finally couldn’t bear it, spitting out a sullen mouthful of blood. A reassuring thought suddenly flashed through her mind: At least this time my clothes weren’t damaged. I don’t need to change again, right… Although Shen Qingqiu had sent her flying, she still scratched five gashes in his sleeve. Frightened, he said internally: Didn’t I cut these fingernails off an hour ago? Is it possible that even her fingernails have unlimited regeneration? After hitting Sha Hualing, he promptly turned his head to look at Liu Mingyan, but his feet slid out from under him as soon as he saw her. In this short a time, she had unexpectedly put her veil back on right awayhow about letting me take a peek? Yang YiXuan had found his sword sticking out of a seam in the rock and started to chop the chains on the cage doors with matchless speed. The freed cultivators huddled in a mass. Shen Qingqiu saw, out of the corner of his eye, the blue silhouettes of San Mayou and said with great alarm, “Stop, stop! Don’t do anything impulsive!” Yang Yixuan, worried about his shout, turned back to look: “Is there some sort of problem, Elder?” Before he finished speaking, he saw which cage he had just broken open. From within, three dainty Daoist nuns, looking like they had been cast from the same mold, rushed out of Chi Yun Cave like three whirlwinds. Buddy, going through and randomly releasing everyone like thisyou’ve released some people who really shouldn’t leave! The three sisters responsible for absorbing Luo Binghe’s demonic energy long-term had been released! This blunder had already been set in stone. Even if he watered his heart with his tears, he couldn’t chase them down and stuff them back in the cages. There was no other way. He could only join in releasing people. As he started freeing people, he sighed in despair. We’re dead. He managed to spoil the ‘first meeting between the male protagonist and three members of the harem’ plot thread. A freak accident managed to disturb the ‘fooling around and cultivating’ storyline. He could only attach himself to the hope that the hardworking employee Sha Hualing could fight them by enormous force of will and recapture them to present to Luo Binghe next time. What a crime, what a crime! Shen Qingqiu was still wallowing in remorse when, lowering his headhis heart gave a thumphe suddenly found himself looking at a familiar face. Not good, not good. It sure is an unlucky year, meeting enemies on a narrow road. Qiu Haitang was huddled in the cage, staring at him with a bewildered expression. Shen Qingqiu froze for a couple of seconds and decided to feign ignorance, motioning to her to come out, then nonchalantly turned around. In his current body, no one (should) recognize him. In addition, five years ago countless pairs of eyes had witnessed the scene of Shen Qingqiu’s self- destruction. There was no good reason to have a guilty conscience. After spitting out blood, Sha Hualing dizzily lay on the floor for a while before finally struggling to a seated position with great difficulty. Staring at Shen Qingqiu, she said in a stern voice, “It’s you? Who the hell are you? You even dare to chase me over hereyou really have some guts!” Yang Yixuan looked like he had suddenly thought of this question as well, blurting out a sentence while setting people free: “Oh right, Elder, who are you?” ‘Oh, right’you’re kidding me. Young man, this reaction time really is too long! Also, what’s with you carelessly asking this in passing! Shen Qingqiu was considering whether to announce himself with the title of Peerless Cucumber again, when Sha Hualing humphed, “Whatever, if you came then don’t think you’ll be able to leave.” She clapped her hands, bells jingling around her wrists. After a moment, Chi Yun Cave’s guard regiment finally flooded into the hall. Chi Yun Cave was Sha Hualing’s official private residence so her standard underlings weren’t here. The shrimp soldiers and crab generals 161 were nothing to be afraid of. Those minor demons circled around them as they raised and lowered their arms, looking exactly like they were doing a sorcerer’s dance. Shen Qingqiu was mystified by this sight. In a twitchy state of mind, he prepared to send them flying with his fan when suddenly he felt like his body was bound with countless strands of hair. Immortal-Binding Cables. Even though those mixed troops didn’t have much fighting strength, they were clearly well-trained. Holding a strip of hair-thin Immortal-Binding Cable, they around circled him non-stop, winding him into a giant ball of string, fully wrapped with Immortal-Binding Cables.Sha Hualing hadn’t managed to cheer in victory before Shen Qingqiu laughed, then violently stomped on the floor. The air filled with the sound of snapping strings. They burst. The Immortal-Binding Cables had indeed been filled to bursting by this person’s spiritual energy! Almost everyone on the scene was so terrified that they completely forgot the task at hand. This was truly the first time they had seen someone who could use spiritual energy to simply burst the Immortal-Binding Cables. What a simple and brutal method of freeing oneself! Shen Qingqiu yelled, “Run first!” The freed cultivators didn’t need any more encouragementmost of them were already long gone. Yang Yixuan and Liu Mingyan had struggled free of the Immortal-Binding Cables not long ago, but the circulation of their spiritual energy was still unstable. Knowing they would only get in the way if they stayed and seeing that they shouldn’t inconvenience Shen Qingqiu with a reply, they crisply retreated, leaving only a “take care of yourself.” Seeing this, Sha Hualing’s underlings didn’t know whether or not to chase them and stood stricken in their original places, waiting for their superior’s orders. Sha Hualing’s eyes lit up. She pointed at Shen Qingqiu and shouted, “Catch him! Don’t worry about the others! Just himget him even if you have to die first!” Shen Qingqiu sent the few mixed soldiers who threw themselves at him flying with his fan when suddenly something heavy pushed down on the top of his head. A giant net! Countless strands of Immortal-Binding Cable that were as thick a pinky finger were woven into a giant net, pelting down onto his head. When it fell onto his body, the weight of the net alone made Shen Qingqiu soft in the knees, nearly tossing him to the ground. So it’s this sort of unnatural prop. For every strand of cable to be this thick are you trying to use it to bind ‘immortals’ or elephants? Sha Hualing waited a while, and, after confirming that Shen Qingqiu couldn’t struggle free this time, slowly approached. The difficult situation freshly swept away, Sha Hualing felt that she had performed a great service. Perfectly contented, her reprimands took on a coquettish tone. She said, chuckling, “If a hundred Immortal-Binding Cables can’t tie you up, then why wouldn’t I use a thousand, or ten thousand? This Immortal-Binding Net originally wasn’t prepared for you, so you should feelextremely honored that it was used on you. Don’t flail about! I’ll go easier on you if you’re well-behaved. Shen Qingqiu said, “If you’re talking about going easy on me, can I trouble you to withdraw this net?” The demon race’s star employee Sha Hualing started her grand missionary speech. Crouching down, she said as if talking to herself, “It looks like you were endowed with extraordinary innate skill. If you were to pledge allegiance to my banner, you could easily obtain splendid power and influence. Of course, it doesn’t really matter if you’re not willing to pledge allegiance. What has to be done has to be done, and suffering for your actions is unavoidable. You should carefully consider your options.” No wonder Sha Hualing had ignored the others just now and concentrated all her firepower on him. Luo Binghe needed human vessels with rich and powerful spiritual energy. Of all the cultivators she had captured, none could compare to his current level of spiritual power. It seems like this girl was planning on offering him to Luo Binghe as a human vessel! Releasing the three beautiful flowers was a thoughtless mistake, pure and simple. But Shen Qingqiu certainly never planned on making up for the shortfall himself. This feeling of accidentally picking up the wrong script made him vaguely wish that fraudulent System was still there. While he was still pondering plans to escape, Sha Hualing suddenly neatened her slightly messy hair, and, with a swing of her hips, forged ahead out of the hall. Far away, Shen Qingqiu heard the sound of her docile laughter. “My lord, today isn’t the night of the full moon. Why did you think to visit this subordinate? But you came at just the right time. As it turns out, I’ve prepared a special gift for youit’s already here.” In a split second, a flood of hot blood surged to Shen Qingqiu’s head even as he broke out into a cold sweat. Not knowing where he got the burst of explosive energy, he grabbed the side of the net, willing the bottomless pools of spiritual energy in his body to emerge as explosive power. “Bang!” A giant sound boomed. Sha Hualing’s smile suddenly froze stiff on her face. She hurried back into the inner hall in a panic, immediately staring tongue- tied at the sight. In the middle of the hall, Chi Yun Cave’s minor demons all swayed unsteadily, laid out on the floor in disorder. There was an immense hole in thecenter of the Immortal-Binding Net, edges still sizzling with flashing sparks, wisps of white smoke drifting through the air. This person is truly too formidable. He even blew a hole in this Immortal- Binding Net with brute force. He’s gone! The person behind gained on her, unhurriedly stepping into the hall. Chi Yun Cave was lightless and dim, and one could only see a straight and slender silhouette dressed in black robes faintly patterned with reflective silver thread. After a moment, Luo Binghe spoke in a tone that was neither pleased nor angered. “This is your special gift?” Sha Hualing said hatefully, “A momentary miscalculation, he got away!” Her distressed heart was dripping blood. When used against Cang Qiong Mountain sect’s loathsome cultivators, an Immortal-Binding Net woven from over a thousand Immortal-Binding Cables got blown a giant hole just like that. This isn’t the sort of thing that could be sewn up by a needle and thread and be reused! Luo Binghe, with his back facing her, lowered his head and looked over the wreckage. He said, coldly, “I seem to have told you Cang Qiong Mountain sect’s people were off-limits?” Drops of cold sweat dripped down Sha Hualing’s forehead. Luo Binghe had indeed told her such, but the spiritual energy of Cang Qiong Mountain sect’s disciples was universally stronger than the spiritual energy of the disciples of other sects by a chunkthey made the best human extraction vessels. Holding on to wishful thinking, she had still captured a few, thinking that maybe she could switch their clothes and slip them through undetected. She didn’t expect that through some unknown method, Luo Binghe would still be able to tell what sort of people she had captured even after they had all escaped. Internally, she couldn’t help but feel her blood run cold, and said hurriedly, “Don’t be angry, my lord, I had accidentally captured two of them, but I soon let them go. This time, this subordinate found an exceptional individual. I had never before seen a cultivator with more abundant spiritual energy. With that one person, you’ll never need to switch to a new human vessel every month.” She bit her lip and continued, “As long as you’ll give me… a certain thing.” After waiting for a moment, she suddenly extended her hand to catch the certain object tossed her way. Securely grasping it in her palm, she showed a determined smile."
"沈清秋肝胆俱裂。 肝胆俱裂的原因 , 不是因为他很可能刚刚才从洛冰河眼皮底下爆种逃出来，而是因为，他 在那一瞬间，好像听见了一个熟悉的声音。 一个有着谷歌翻译腔般刻板机械的声音。 我屮！ 说好的换了硬件不带病毒呢？！ 说好的洗心革面从此做人海阔天高任鸟飞呢？！ 沈清秋掩耳盗铃般捂着耳朵从魔界风驰电掣奔入人界，从荒岭一路狂飙回边境之地，那声 音一直魔音贯脑，仿佛驻扎在他神经里。 【…… 激活 …… 激活 …… 灵魂绑定 …… 】 【…… 修复 …… 联系客服 …… 】 因为是灵魂绑定 , 所以遇到洛冰河后又激活了是不是？！ 因为换身体了 , 所以接触不良，要联系客服修理对不对？ 男主真是他命中魔星！ 沈清秋诅咒了一路，幸好系统除了半死不活重复那几个关键词 , 好歹没能说出完整的句 子。他这才放缓步子 , 慢慢走回镇上。 边境之地的小镇白天看起来比夜晚要有人气。说不上繁华 , 不宽不宅的街道，不多不少的 行人，店面都开张后，也可算欣欣向荣。 茶肆之旁，招旗飘飘，有一对少年男女仗剑而望，走了过去，问道： “ 你们怎么还没回苍 穹山派？ ” 柳溟烟向他微施一礼。杨一玄急忙道： “ 别派弟子都回去了。眼下见前辈脱险了，我们也 就放心了。 ” 沈清秋与他们一同进入茶肆，找了张桌子坐一坐。一旁有人原本在闲聊，瞥眼见他，顿时 惊叫道： “ 啊，是 …… 是 ……” 沈清秋回头一看，是他刚从土里爬出来那晚上救过的几名守境弟子。最先看到他的那人支 支吾吾叫不出来，卢六忙道： “ 原来是绝世 …… 先生！ ” “ 绝世 ” 后面他是说了两个字，可听起来极其含糊，压在舌头底下含混而过，其余几分忙纷 纷效仿： “ 原来是绝世 …… 前辈！ ” 沈清秋向他们点头致意，心里决定了一定要另取高号。刻不容缓！ 杨一玄茫然道： “ 前辈，你姓黄吗？黄花？光华？ ” 沈清秋咳了两声，也含混道： “ 就是 …… 嘛。 ” 这个 id 用了这么多年，算是头一次有点羞耻之心。他略一正色，道： “ 昨晚各派弟子都在 赤云窟看到了我，虽说是瞒不住了，但如果旁人问我起来，你们能少说的还是少说吧。如 能闭口不提，那是最好。 ” 杨一玄道： “ 为什么？前辈你与家师不是相熟吗？ ” “ 呃，熟是挺熟 ……” 沈清秋正不知该怎么说，旁边那桌接着聊天。有人边吐瓜子壳边道： “ 六哥，你倒是接着 说呀，到底另一种解释是什么？ ” 卢六道： “ 要说起这另一种解释，那可有意思的多了。这一说法，似乎是从内部人士那里 流传开来的，这洛冰河与沈清秋 ……” 沈清秋听到这两个名字，心里咯噔一声，不由自主挺直了腰板，竖起耳朵旁听，手里的扇 子也摇得慢了。苍穹山派两人也不住侧目。 卢六喝了一口茶，道： “ 这洛冰河与沈清秋是师徒，对吧？洛冰河此人，出身寒门，自小 受尽人世困苦，入苍穹山派门下后，也有一段时间不得赏识，被同门打压欺辱。幸好，沈 清秋待他十分之亲厚。 ” 他说得摇头晃脑，抑扬顿挫，手里给搁只梨花木，就和说书先生没什么两样了。沈清秋暗 暗点头：对的，没踹洛冰河下去之前，他自问对他还是蛮有良心的。 杨一玄哼了一声，道： “ 待他亲厚有什么用。 ” 有人诧异道： “ 这说法不就跟沈清秋虐徒的传言反了吗？ ” 卢六道： “ 这你就惊讶了？那后面还说这对师徒日夜相对，情愫暗生，你该怎么办？ ” 这边桌上三人原本茶水都入了口，听了这一句，沈清秋和杨一玄齐齐喷了。柳溟烟虽然没 喷，手一抖，茶碗一歪，撒了满桌。 那一桌吸气声此起彼伏： “ 还有这种说法！ ” 卢六道： “ 正是。不过，严格地来说，是洛冰河单方面对沈清秋心怀孽念，一厢情愿。 ” 一厢情愿？一厢情愿？！ “ 沈清秋是什么人？清静峰峰主。清静峰什么路子？清心寡欲，一门心思只扑在摄典修行 上。洛冰河求之不得，这才因爱生恨！ ” 沈清秋额头手背青筋暴起。 杨一玄震惊道： “ 因、因爱生恨？ ” 卢六接着说： “ 如此一来，就非常好解释了。仙盟大会一事，肯定是这样的： “ 洛冰河作为清静峰首徒出战，成绩斐然，自觉心中有了底气。恰逢魔物失控，结界封山 ，沈清秋入绝地谷支援。洛冰河一时鬼迷心窍，趁机向师尊表露心迹。 ” 沈清秋痛苦地扶额。 为什么，总觉得这个人十句话里有九句都可以说没错，但就是最后一句听起来这么怪呢？ 而且就是这一句，把整个段落的味道都变得奇怪起来了！ 卢六肃然道： “ 沈清秋洁身自好，自然严词拒绝。 ” 沈清秋动容。可真没想到， “ 洁身自好 ” 这个词现在还有人肯用到他身上。 紧接着，剧情急转直下，卢六激动道： “ 谁知道，被拒绝之后，洛冰河绝望之下，歹念横 生，竟丧心病狂、大逆不道，欲强逼沈清秋就范从之！ ” 沈清秋把手指插入满头乱发中，深深埋头。 杨一玄已经说不出话了，少年刚被打开新世界的大门，备受冲击中。柳溟烟则轻轻 “ 啊 ” 了 一声。 只听她道： “ 原来如此。 ” 原来如此什么啊？！？！ “ 此” 是哪个此啊？！？！ 不要以为你是女主我就不会黑你！！！ 不知不觉，卢六那一桌已经聚满了听八卦的围观群众，瓜子板凳满地都是，全神贯注，这 时齐齐叹道： “ 禽兽啊 ” “ 真是禽兽不如啊 ” 叹息声中，却都是满足无比的意味。 大哥你究竟是守境巡逻小分队队长的还是八卦小分队队长？！ 卢六把茶碗猛地一搁，仿佛拍下惊堂木。 “ 沈清秋哪肯就范！师徒交锋，还是师父更胜一筹，洛冰河落败而退，黯然离去。 “ 虽然撕破脸皮，可沈清秋仍不忍毁去爱徒声誉，不好明说，只借口，洛冰河已死于魔族 之手。 “ 所以，这，就是洛冰河仙盟大会后失踪数年、未死却不回苍穹山派的真相。 “ 他不是不想见，是没脸见师尊啊！ ” 好激烈的剧情！ 这两个强【哔  】犯和白莲花圣母是谁啊！？ 关键是强【哔  】还没强【哔  】成功，太挫了。这怎么可能是洛冰河！他要强【哔  】谁，谁都会乖乖自己打开腿好吗？！ 卢六道： “ 仙盟大会情场失意后，洛冰河另有奇遇，练就一身绝世奇功，还得到了幻花宫 宫主的垂青。可他对沈清秋仍不死心，卷土重来，这才有了金兰城之变。 “ 苍穹山派不是都一口咬定洛冰河是魔族吗？我看也未必空穴来风。多半是发现了他和魔 族勾结、污蔑沈清秋的蛛丝马迹。沈清秋高高在上，洛冰河不能入眼，他就要把沈清秋拉 下马来，折光他的傲气！ ” …… 沈清秋不知道自己放弃了什么，总而言之，就是忽然感到身心一阵轻松，什么都不想 听，也不想管了。 他和颜悦色对另外两人道； “ 点菜吧。 ” 卢六回头说了一句： “ 绝世 …… 先生你们这一桌算我账上。 ” 然后回头，继续痛心疾首。 “ 洛冰河想尽千方百计，把沈清秋关到幻花宫水牢里。幻花宫什么地方？早就被他翻手为 云覆手雨，收入囊中。说是暂时收押沈清秋等待四派联审，却无异于羊入虎口。关进水牢 的那几天，沈清秋为捆仙索束缚，灵力尽失，谁知道这个逆徒对他做了什么？！ ” 众人高低不一，啧声连连： “ 果然是逆徒 ” “ 养虎为患 ” 沈清秋扔开菜单： “ 要不咱们换个地儿吧。 ” 卢六道： “ 沈清秋不堪受辱，拼了一条命逃出来，谁知到花月城就被洛冰河发的通缉令截 住了。他不得已请求百战峰峰主出面相助。苍穹山派上下一心，柳清歌当然应允。 “ 洛冰河心胸狭窄，醋坛大翻，与柳清歌斗了个天翻地覆，就要狠下杀手，沈清秋无可奈 何，只得当场自爆 …… 从此 ……” 他不往后接着说，意味深长地留白，引得众人一片唏嘘。 最后，卢六才下了定论： “ 这就是在私底下流传更广的另一种解释。虽然听起来极为荒谬 ，简直无稽之谈。但其中许多细节都有可考之处。诸君，切记，野史方为正史啊。 ” 细节一点都不可靠好吗！！！ 正史你妹！！！ 八卦去死！去死！ 劳资就算没有妹子再悲惨也沦落不到要搞基的地步！！！ 眼见杨柳二人还在发呆，沈清秋斥责道： “ 赶紧吃，吃完了赶紧回去！。 ” 在这里多留一刻，不知道人生观世界观价值观还要受到怎样的冲击！ 护送二人离开边境之地，沈清秋选了个和他们相反的方向。 行至月上中天之时，他耳朵极其敏锐地捕捉到了一阵若有若无的鬼魅铃音。 沈清秋头也不回道： “ 你还真是阴魂不散。 ” 被识破行踪，纱华铃也不打算继续藏匿，大大方方地走了出来，手挽红纱，笑道： “ 对待 那两人这般细心，阁下与苍穹山派究竟有什么渊源？ ” 沈清秋转身，摇了摇手指，道： “ 我不跟你打，你也别想打我的主意。 ” 凭现在纱华铃的斤两，也打不了他的主意。 纱华铃笑容诡异： “ 现在才想脱身？太迟了。 ” 沈清秋刚想小小吓唬她一下，忽然周身一震。 一种熟悉又可怕的感觉从小腹中蔓延开来。仿佛一只千足蜈蚣在心肝肺腹中穿行。 沈清秋一时有些腿脚发软，可还是牢牢站住了。 他咬牙道： “…… 你什么时候给我吃的。 ” 纱华铃轻佻地道： “ 今天镇上的酒菜好吃吗？幸好你吃了，你要是自恃境界高，不肯入口 ，我还真有点儿头疼呢。 ” 草，太大意了！ 她绕着沈清秋转了一圈，得意洋洋： “ 你知道自己身体里现在有什么东西吗？这可不是普 通的毒药。 ” …… 废话！老子比你熟悉，天魔血老子都吃过两次了，两次啊！ 一般是吃一次死一次，谁中奖次数比我多！ 除原主之外，旁人无法操控天魔之血，而此刻血虫都在他体内蠢蠢欲动，那么，只能说明 一件事。 纱华铃忽然向沈清秋侧后方躬身，道： “ 得您赐血，属下不负所托，已将此人擒下。 ” 沈清秋僵直地回过头。 空气被斩开一道黑色闪电般的裂口，正在缓缓闭合。 一道修长的身影立在他身后，沈清秋这一回头，正正与他打了个照面。 洛冰河居高临下俯视着他，并无表情，可沈清秋被他两道泠泠的目光一照，别说只是多了 一层胡子，他有种感觉，再多掩饰都无所遁形。 沈清秋咽了咽喉咙。 以往的洛冰河，仿佛暖阳映照初雪，即便在金兰城和水牢，多少还有一丝人味儿，而此刻 这个青年，无论面容还是神情，都像是冻结千年、直达地心的雪域冰川，使人见之胆寒。 洛冰河 …… 彻底变了。 半晌无语。 刚开始，洛冰河的表情迷惑了一瞬间，这使得他的脸看起来稍稍柔软了些。很快，这丝柔 软便消散无踪。 洛冰河瞳孔骤缩，额头一缕红纹流过。 他袖子都没摆一下，纱华铃忽然悬空吊起，仿佛被一只无形举手掐着脖子抓起，痛苦地咳 嗽。 同时，沈清秋五脏中那一滴天魔血疯狂地分裂为千丝万缕，钻进钻出，冷汗浸透背部。 洛冰河轻飘飘地道： “ 你胆子真是不小。 ” 他语气虽轻，可任谁都能感觉出来，潜藏在这语气之下的 …… 暴怒。 胆子不小？是说他，还是说纱华铃？ 洛冰河似乎没认出他。 现在这张脸虽然和沈清秋还是很像，但还有两分沈垣的影子。以洛冰河观察力之细致，就 算隔着一层胡子也能轻而易举辨别出细微的不同。看样子，应该是把他当成了相貌相似之 人。 但是没认出来也很惨啊！ 姨妈痛到停不下来！ 纱华铃不知为什么洛冰河会忽然大怒，边挣扎边泪眼朦胧盯着沈清秋看了一阵，忽然露出 见了鬼一样的表情。 她惶恐道： “…… 属下也不知此事，这完全是巧合！君上饶命、这回真不是我做的！ ” 沈清秋对现在的状况莫名其妙。纱华铃怎么混到这个地步的。她应该是后宫最受宠的女主 （之一）了。 纱华铃却心中叫苦连天。 因为她有前科。 自从被洛冰河收入麾下之后，她见他整日对着一具尸体，不明缘由，却自作聪明，从人界 找了个容貌与沈清秋有五分像的，再小施修饰，做到十成相似，可说是鬼斧神工。她把这 仿制品送到了洛冰河面前。 结果，不但没讨到洛冰河欢心，反而让他大发雷霆，险些把整个赤云窟都屠净。 纱华铃永远都忘不了、也再不想见到洛冰河那副表情。 谁知这次这个人，恰恰和那死人容貌有八成相似。 这无疑又犯了洛冰河的大忌！","CHAPTER 47: JIANGHU GOSSIP At that time, countless reasons had already appeared for Shen Qingqiu to be all torn up about his situation. These reasons were not that he had just made an explosive escape under Luo Binghe’s eyes, but because in that split second he had heard an extremely familiar and hateful sound. A voice with a mechanical accent like Google Translate. I thought I had already scrubbed this clean. I thought I established that switching the hardware would get rid of the virus? That since turning over a new leaf I could melt into the sea of people and have the freedom to fly like a bird through the broad skies? Blocking his ears like the bell thief with covered ears 162 , Shen Qingqiu rushed from the demon realm to the human realm as fast as lightning, running like a hurricane all the way from Huang Ling to the outer borders. That devilish sound continuously poured into his mind like it was setting up camp in his psyche. … activating… activating… soul binding… … debugging… contacting customer service… Was it because of this ‘soul binding’ that the System reactivated after running into Luo Binghe? Did the connection break after switching bodies, so you needed to contact customer service to debug the program? Luo Binghe is truly the devilish guiding star of his life! Fortunately, aside from repeating those few keywords in a half-dead manner, at least the System could not speak in complete sentences. Shen Qingqiu had been smacking his head the entire way back, but after seeing signs of human habitation appearing ahead and considering his appearance, he slowed his steps and walked back to the garrison town. This small border town seemed more alive in the day than during the night. It couldn’t be called flourishingthe streets were neither wide nor bordered with homes and pedestrians were neither many nor fewbut with the storefronts open it could be called thriving in its own right. Next to the tea shop, sign flag 163 fluttering in the wind, a young man and woman stood gazing into the distance, swords in hand. Shen Qingqiu walked over and asked, “Why have you still not returned to Cang Qiong Mountain?” Liu Mingyan sent him a small salute. Yang Yixuan hastily said, “Thedisciples from the other sects have already gone back. Seeing that Elder has managed to escape, we won’t have to worry anymore either.” Shen Qingqiu went along with them into the tea shop, finding a table to sit down. To the side, some people who were originally chatting idly, suddenly cried out in alarm after getting a glimpse of him. “Ah, it’s… it’s…” Shen Qingqiu turned around to look. It turns out it was those border guard disciples he had saved the night he had just crawled out of the ground. The person who had first seen him stammered, unable to call out a name. Lu Liu hurriedly said, “It’s you, Mister Peerless…!” He had said the last two characters of the name after “Peerless,” but it sounded extremely vague, becoming too ambiguous after being pressed under his tongue. The others, a bit hurriedly, followed his lead one after the another: “It’s you, Elder Peerless…!” Shen Qingqiu nodded his greetings, internally deciding that he must take another title, brooking no delay. Yang Yixuan blankly said, “Elder, is your last name Huang (Yellow)? Huang Hua (Yellow Flower)? Guang Hua (Magnificent Light) 164 ?” Shen Qingqiu sighed, twice, and also said vaguely, “It’s…” After using this ID for so many years, he finally felt a bit ashamed for the first time. He put on a stern expression and said, “Last night, you disciples from various sects saw me in Chi Yun Cave. I couldn’t conceal myself there, so if other people ask about me, say as little about me as possible. It would be best if you could keep your mouths shut entirely.” Yang Yixuan said, “Why? Elder, aren’t you familiar with my master?” “Uh, we are indeed quite familiar…” Shen Qingqiu still didn’t know what to say when the table to the side continued their conversation. One person asked while spitting out melon seed shells, “Liu-ge, why don’t you elaboratewhat sort of alternate explanation could there be?” Lu Liu said, “That alternate explanation is very interesting. This opinion seems to have spread from people on the inside. This Luo Binghe and Shen Qingqiu…” Upon hearing these two names, Shen Qingqiu’s heart gave a thump. Involuntarily, he straightened his posture, pricking up his ears to listen. The waving of the fan in his hands slowed. The two from Cang Qiong Mountain sect also could not resist looking over. Lu Liu drank a mouthful of tea and said, “This Luo Binghe and ShenQingqiu were master and disciple, right? This Luo Binghe came from a poor and humble family and suffered the hardships of the world since he was young. After becoming a disciple of Cang Qiong Mountain sect he was still under-appreciated for a while and was beaten down and humiliated by his peers. Fortunately, Shen Qingqiu treated him with generosity and deep affection.” He spoke with grandeur and musical inflection, vibrantly acting out each word, giving professional storytellers a run for their money 165 . Shen Qingqiu subtly nodded. Right, before he had kicked Luo Binghe down into the Endless Abyss, you bet he was quite kindhearted. Yang Yixuan snorted and said, “What use did that generosity and affection have? It still wasn’t…” One person said, flabbergasted, “Isn’t this version of events the complete opposite of the rumor that Shen Qingqiu oppressed his disciples?” Lu Liu said, “You’re already astonished at this? Then what are you going to do when I continue to explain the rumors that this pair of master and disciple were together day and night with sincere emotion born in secret?” The three people at Shen Qingqiu’s table had taken a mouthful of tea, but upon hearing this sentence, Shen Qingqiu and Yang Yixuan simultaneously spat it out. Though Liu Mingyan didn’t spit out her mouthful, her hand shook, tilting her teacup and spilling tea all over the table. The whole table sucked in a breath here and there: “There’s this sort of rumor?” Lu Liu said, “That’s right! But, strictly speaking, it was Luo Binghe harboring one-sided impure thoughts towards Shen Qingqiu, his own wishful thinking.” His own wishful thinking? His own wishful thinking? “What sort of person was Shen Qingqiu? Qing Jing Peak’s Peak Lord. What was the way of Qing Jing Peak? Tranquility of heart and forsaking of desire, setting one’s heart on throwing oneself into the lawful path of cultivation. Shen Qingqiu saw through the mortal world and didn’t get tangled in the foolish sentiments of normal people. It was because that Luo Binghe sought something he failed to get that hate was born from love!” Blue veins popped up on Shen Qingqiu’s forehead and the backs of his hands. Yang Yixuan said, astonished, “H-hate born from love?” Lu Liu continued, “Thinking of it this way, it’s very easy to explain everything else. The whole sequence of events at the Immortal AllianceConference was definitely like this: “Luo Binghe, as Qing Jing Peak’s head disciple, was sent to compete. Because of his remarkable performance, he was filled with confidence in himself. It just happened that at that time, demons ran loose within the sealed mountain and Shen Qingqiu entered Jue Di Gorge to provide backup. Luo Binghe was caught up in the moment and seized the opportunity to confess his true feelings to his Shizun.” Shen Qingqiu facepalmed in pain. Why, why does it always seem like for this person, out of every ten sentences there are nine that are not bad, but it’s always the last one that sounds so strange? In addition, it’s exactly this sentence that changes the meaning of the whole incident into something so strange! Lu Liu said solemnly, “Shen Qingqiu had a noble and unsullied character and naturally gave a firm rejection.” Shen Qingqiu was faintly moved. Other than his Zhangmen Shixiong 166 , he never expected to find an outsider willing to apply the phrase “noble and unsullied character” to his person. Who would have thought that immediately afterward the storyline would take a dramatic turn? Lu Liu said with a voice full of emotion, “Who could have guessed that after being rejected, Luo Binghe would become desperate? Overflowing with evil intent, he even lost his mind and went berserk. In a disgraceful and unfilial act, his desire led him to try and make Shen Qingqiu submit by force!” Shen Qingqiu sunk his fingers into his head of messy hair, sunk in deep despair. Yang Yixuan was already speechless. The gates of a whole new world had just been opened for that young man, and he was being battered by new perspectives. Liu Mingyan, on the other hand, just let out a soft “Ah.” She only carefully said, “So it was like that.” ‘So it was like that’ what? Which ‘that’ is ‘that’ referring to? Don’t think I won’t fight you just because you’re the female protagonist! Before they had noticed, a crowd of spectators had congregated at Lu Liu’s table to listen to the gossip, melon seeds and wooden benches covering the floor. Listening with rapt attention, they all sighed at this point, “What a beast of a person” “Not only a beast, simply worse than a beast”In the sound of these sighs, all seemed to have satisfied a matchless interest. Big Brother, are you the captain of the border patrol squad or the gossip squad? Lu Liu abruptly slammed his teacup down like a gavel 167 . “There’s no way Shen Qingqiu would be willing to submit! The master and disciple crossed swords. The end result was that the Shifu won an extra chip and Luo Binghe retreated in defeat, sadly making his exit. “Even though they had an acrimonious falling-out and tore into each other, Shen Qingqiu still couldn’t bear to ruin the reputation of his beloved disciple. It wouldn’t do to explain things clearly, so he used the excuse that Luo Binghe had met his death at the hands of the Demon Race. Though he did preserve the reputation of this disciple, he wasn’t willing to go to extremes. “So, this is the truth behind Luo Binghe’s years-long disappearance after the Immortal Alliance Conference and why he did not return to the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect even though he was not dead. “It’s not that he didn’t want to see, it’s that he didn’t have the face to see his Shizun!” On that end, his story was in full swing. On his end, Shen Qingqiu was watering his heart with tears. What an intense storyline! Who are these twothe assaulter and the white lotus flower Virgin Mary? The key is whether he was able to succeed in forcing himself or notthis is really dampening the point of a damned urgent issue. How could this happen to Luo Binghe? If he wanted to force himself on someone, who wouldn’t obediently spread their legs? Lu Liu said, “After the frustrating emotional affairs of the Immortal Alliance Conference, Luo Binghe had another fortuitous meeting. He trained until he gained exceptional achievements from head to toe, and even gained the favor of Huan Hua Temple’s Old Palace Master. But, he was still unwilling to give up on Shen Qingqiu. Returning in a swirl of dust, then occurred the events of Hua Yue City. “Doesn’t Cang Qiong Mountain Sect all flatly insist that Luo Binghe is of the Demon Race? The way I see it, it’s not necessarily wind from an empty cave. Most likely, they discovered tiny hints that he was colluding with the Demon Race to slander Shen Qingqiu’s reputation 168 . Shen Qingqiu was aloof and untouchable and Luo Binghe couldn’t come into his sight, so he wanted to pullShen Qingqiu off his high horse. A complete bodily defeat and fall from grace would destroy his haughtiness!” Shen Qingqiu didn’t know what he had let go of. In short, he suddenly felt his body and mind relax. He didn’t want to listen to anything or care about anything. He said with a pleasant countenance to the other two, “Let’s order our dishes.” Lu Liu took the chance to say, “Mister Peerless… you can count your table on my tab.” Then turning back around, he continued with a tone full of grief and lament: “Luo Binghe thought of every possible means to shut Shen Qingqiu in Huan Hua Temple’s water prison. You ask what he was up to? His rapacious designs were clear to see. Huan Hua Temple had long been in his pocket so he could command wind and cloud with a wave of his hand. They claimed to be keeping Shen Qingqiu in temporary custody pending the four sects’ joint investigation, but there was little difference from keeping a lamb in a tiger’s den. In those few days shut in the water prison, Shen Qingqiu was bound with Immortal-Binding Cables. Completely without spiritual energy, who knew what this perverse disciple did to him?” The crowd, in one voice, interjected in disgust, “What a perverse disciple!” “Raising a tiger invites calamity!” Shen Qingqiu threw aside his menu. “How about we go somewhere else.” Lu Liu said, “Shen Qingqiu couldn’t bear this humiliation, and gathered up all his strength to escape. Who knew that he would be cut off in Hua Yue City by the search party that Luo Binghe sent? Cang Qiong Mountain Sect was of one heart, and Bai Zhan Peak’s Peak Lord Liu Qingge naturally went ahead to provide assistance. This attempt at assistance was met head-on by Luo Binghe. “Luo Binghe’s seas of jealousy could overturn the heavens. Not allowing any explanation, he knocked Liu Qingge head over heels, hand raised for a ruthless killing stroke. Shen Qingqiu, with no other way out, could only self- destruct on the scene… henceforth…” He didn’t continue on after that, profoundly leaving a blank space in his work, inviting a chorus of sighs from his audience. Finally, Lu Liu arrived at his conclusion. “This is precisely the secretly spread alternate explanation. Even though it sounds a bit absurd and could beregarded as complete nonsense by some people, it does contain many details which give one something to consider. Gentlemen, remember at all costs that official histories are often whitewashed or embellished by official scribes, the actual facts being concealed, and that in many cases popular history is taken as official!” The particulars are not even a little reliable, okay! ‘Official history’ your sister! Big brother, even if I suffered a worse tragedy than not getting any sisters for twenty years I wouldn’t resort to becoming a cut-sleeve! Let alone hooking up with the male protagonist! After the young waitress gracefully wove her way up to deliver the dishes, Yang Yixuan and Liu Mingyan were still staring blankly into the distance. Shen Qingqiu reprimanded, “Hurry up and eat. After you finish you should return without delay.” Staying any longer in this sort of dangerous placewho knows what kind of attacks these two children would suffer against their lives, their world views, and their values! After escorting the two juniors out of the borderlands, Shen Qingqiu picked a direction opposite to theirs. Walking until the moon was high in the sky, his extremely keen hearing focused on an indistinct peal of demonic bells. Shen Qingqiu said, not even turning his head, “You truly are the spirit that doesn’t disperse after death.” Her whereabouts having been discovered, Sha Hualing didn’t plan on staying in hiding. Confidently strolling into view, red muslin at her wrists, she smiled. “Who taught you to make Ling-er so curious, sire? To treat those two so attentively, what sort of relationship does your distinguished self have with Cang Qiong Mountain?” Shen Qingqiu turned around and said, waving his finger, “I’m not going to fight with you, and you shouldn’t get any ideas about fighting with me.” Weighing Sha Hualing’s current importance, she couldn’t defeat him. He was just thinking about giving her a scare when suddenly, his whole body gave a jolt. It felt like a thousand-legged centipede was boring its way through his organs. Sha Hualing’s smiling expression took on a crafty bent. “Yes, I am no match for you, but do you think that means there’s no way to control you?” Shen Qingqiu felt his legs go soft for a while but still stood firm. He clenched his teeth and said, “When did you make me eat it.”Sha Hualing said coquettishly, “How was the food and drinks you had today? Were the waitress sisters pretty? Fortunately, you did eat itif you were in a high state and fasting, refusing to let anything enter your mouth, it would really have given Ling-er a headache.” Careless. At the time, his complete attention had been drawn in by the gossip squad captain’s lively and emotional performance. Gossip kills people, ah! She circled a loop around Shen Qingqiu and said, immensely self- satisfied, “Do you know what’s currently in your body? This is certainly no ordinary poison.” No kidding! This elder is more familiar with it than you. I’ve already eaten Heavenly Demons’ blood two times, two times! Normally you eat it once and die once. Who won this lottery more times than me! Other than the original master, no one can control the Heavenly Demons’ blood, and now the blood parasites were beginning to stir in his body. That could only mean one thing. Sha Hualing suddenly bowed to something behind Shen Qingqiu, saying, “This subordinate did not fail you. I have captured this person just now.” Shen Qingqiu stiffly turned his head. Dark lightning had split in the air, creating a rift that was slowly closing. A tall and slender silhouette stood behind him. As Shen Qingqiu turned his head, they finally met face-to-face. Luo Binghe towered above him. Though his gaze was expressionless, under the gaze of those eyes like two cold pools, even another layer of facial hair or a mask would be like no disguise at all. Shen Qingqiu fixed his gaze on him. The former Luo Binghe, while cold, was like the reflection of warm sunlight on fresh snow. Even in Jin Lan City and the water prison, he had some traces of humanity, some faint facial expressions, and would lose control in anger. But this young manhis expression looked as if it had been frozen for a thousand years, directly conveying the fields of snow and glaciers in his core, and made others’ insides freeze over with fear. Despite this, Shen Qingqiu’s current state of mind was not like what he had expected. It was difficult to explain since all sorts of emotions were tangled up in his mind, but the one emotion that most would have experienced was missing: fear.Maybe it was because the best plan he had didn’t succeed in hiding him and that the stars had aligned to return them to their original places, but a state of tranquility and indifference settled over him. A puzzled expression flashed across Luo Binghe’s face for a split second, making his face soften a bit. But quickly, this trace of softness dissipated, leaving no trace. His pupils suddenly contracted and an intricate red mark flickered on the center of his forehead. Before his sleeves had finished a swing, Sha Hualing was suddenly hoisted into the air, coughing painfully like an incorporeal hand had snatched her by the neck. At the same time, that drop of Heavenly Demon’s blood in Shen Qingqiu’s inner organs frantically split into thousands of threads, boring through his insides. Cold sweat soaked his back. Luo Binghe said, lightly, “You’ve certainly got some guts.” Though his tone was light, anyone could feel the violent rage hidden beneath the surface. You’ve got some guts? Who is he speaking tohim or Sha Hualing? Shen Qingqiu’s brain shifted into high gear. Luo Binghe shouldn’t have recognized him, even if this current face had a bit of resemblance to Shen Qingqiu’s original. Even if Luo Binghe’s perception was so meticulous that he could easily recognize minute differences through a layer of whiskers. It seems like he had recognized his resemblance to another… though this line of thinking bore no fruit. It would certainly be disastrous if he was recognized, but not being recognized didn’t lead anywhere good either!"
"洛冰河道： “ 我应该警告过你 , 不准打这张脸的主意。 ” 纱华铃被悬吊在半空中 , 脸色憋得通红，呛声连连 , 艰难地说： “…… 这次 …… 真的不是 属下刻意而为之 ……” …… 果然记仇得很！沈清秋震惊了。 人都死了五年了，到现在居然连看到相貌相似之人都这么生气。看来 , 他真的给洛冰 河留下了很严重的心灵创伤。 忽然，沈清秋腹中剧痛，五脏六腑仿佛被千丝万缕钢针银线穿刺而过。 这时候灵力再爆棚也没用 , 他还是眼前一暗，吐出一口红中带黑的热血。 洛冰河周身气压极低，看他的眼神，正是在看死物的目光。心魔剑在他腰间兴奋地战 栗，嗡鸣不止，仿佛要脱鞘而出。 他一手强压住剑柄，眼底泛起滔天的血红色。 沈清秋抹了抹嘴边的血，见状微楞。 照理说，进入魔界篇后，他应当调节到相对稳定的状态了。每个月吸干个把人，更多 的只是为巩固才对。 可为什么他感觉，洛冰河现在体内的平衡状态越发糟糕了？ 比他自爆压下去的那时候还要汹涌不定。 纱华铃被越吊越高，见沈清秋吐血，知道洛冰河动了杀心，在操控他体内的天魔血， 拼命道： “ 君上 …… 您千万不能杀他 …… 今天就是满月、他一定会有用的，没人比他更合 适了 ……” 她倒不是真的担心沈清秋死活，只是如果任由洛冰河暴怒之下，要了这怪人的命，就 算他体内不魔气狂涌失去神智，下一步也不会让她有好果子吃。 纱华铃声嘶力竭道： “ 就算不在意这个，想想 …… 想想您那位 ……” 她豁了出去，猛地 拔高一个调子： “ 想想圣陵！ ” 听到最后两个字，洛冰河动作微滞。 沈清秋也怔了怔。 圣陵，是魔族历代统治高层长眠之地。 除了现任最高统治者，其余闲杂一概不允入内，违者格杀。 世代累积，陵墓之中，各种法宝灵器陪葬品，数量之庞大，品质之罕有，没人能不垂 涎。据传，陵墓之中，还有能起死回生之逆天神器。 原著洛冰河得纱华铃内应，成功上位，潜入圣陵，那些东西都落到了谁荷包里，大家 懂的。纱华铃在这时候提到圣陵，莫非是在提醒洛冰河，暂时还不能缺她？ 无论如何，她明显找对了方向。 洛冰河听到那两个字后，目中赤色仍幽光闪闪，纱华铃的身子却猛地往下坠了一截， 脚尖勉强能够到地面了。 “ 圣陵。 ” 洛冰河指尖缓缓摩挲心魔剑，抚慰着躁动不安的剑身，低声道： “ 不错，还 有圣陵。 ” 纱华铃正要喘口气，忽听洛冰河问道： “ 你这算是在威胁我吗。 ” 纱华铃顿时魂飞天外： “ 属下不敢！ ” …… 太惨了。好歹是两大女主之一，为什么会沦落到这种地步！ 沈清秋还没来得及慨叹完，就听洛冰河哼了一声。 他仿佛被人猛地拽了一把前胸，整个身体突然被拖了起来。 他眼睛一花，心口刹那间冻结了一般冰凉。 他低头一看，洛冰河一只手贴在他左心口正中之处。 这感觉就像被人当膛开了一炮，弹药是纯黑的魔气，入体之后爆炸般通过灵脉在四肢 百骸间蔓延开来。 系统陡然尖锐明晰起来的提示音吵得他脑袋疼： 【点触验证成功！】 【与总能源对接，蓄力中！】 【系统自我检测，运行正常，感谢您的再次使用！】 这个点触验证是不是有点高级过头了？！ 沈清秋体内的灵体，本来是个蓄满的池子，这一次对接之下，被一口气吸干了大半。 可这干涸也只是一瞬间的状态，露华芝塑成的肉身迅速开始开始灵力回流。回流的灵 力则更迅速地被洛冰河吸收。 沈清秋觉得自己就像个充电宝，心中咆哮：老子上辈子究竟欠洛冰河多少钱？！？！ 洛冰河 “ 咦 ” 了一声，撤回手掌，道： “ 果然有用。 ” 这具肉身不同于以往的引渡容器，被抽取了大半灵力，又被灌注了海量魔气，居然也 能迅速自动填充。 看来纱华铃大费周章、一心要抓住这人，倒也有她的道理。 他话音刚落，纱华铃便跌坐到了地上。 大难不死，逃过一劫，她惊魂未定，不顾膝盖还在发抖，忙摆正姿势，单膝跪地。 洛冰河漠然道： “ 我不管究竟是不是你做的。记住别让我看到他用这张脸。 ” 纱华铃忙埋头道： “ 遵命！ ” 洛冰河随手斩开一道空间裂缝，抬脚跨入。说走就走，简直潇洒到令人发指，就这么 把他们两个人抛在荒原中，似乎完全不关心沈清秋的去留。 也对，他根本不用关心，沈清秋现在喝了他的血，逃到哪儿都不是逃，只消掐指算算 ，就能出现在疼得死去活来的沈清秋面前。 沈清秋蓦地惊醒：所以他这算是成了冰哥的小弟了？！ 好歹洛冰河没认出来他。跟着好好干，说不定会很有前途！【个鬼 不就是每个月来一次？ 来着来着就习惯了！ 沈清秋正风中凌乱，冷不防纱华铃朝他脸上抓来。他两根手指一挡： “ 你干什么？ ” 纱华铃咬牙道： “ 你没听到么？刚才他说了，不想再看到你这张脸！ ” 沈清秋瞪着她，忽然伸手从她袖子上扯了一片布下来。 纱华铃尖叫道： “ 你撕我衣服干什么？！ ” 沈清秋把那片纱布抠了两个洞，罩在脸上，只露出眼睛： “ 我衣服够破了，借你的用 用。你遇事就只会抓人脸这一招？拿块布遮遮不就得了，非要毁容吗？ ” 要不是这人今后洛冰河每个月都要用到一次，得保证他毫发无损，纱华铃当场就想把 他千刀万剐。 再想想，纵使洛冰河厌恶仿制品，却也恐怕不会喜欢看到这张脸鲜血淋漓的模样，纱 华铃只好忍气吞声，喝道： “ 走！ ” 走就走，反正现在走哪儿去都差不多了，不如一步算一步观望着。沈清秋盘算，洛冰 河彻底压下心魔剑之后，大概也用不着他了，那时候彻底江湖再见，应该也不是多遥远的 事。只要万事小心，别被他发现自己用露华芝玩了一手金蝉脱壳就行。 沈清秋适应角色的速度简直奇快，也跟着跨入那道裂缝。纱华铃最后一个跟进，裂口 缓缓闭合。 她心想，今后这人也算半个同僚，问道： “ 你叫什么？ ” 裂缝之后连接的，是一条长廊，两壁雕镂繁复，百花争鸣，只是光线黯淡。沈清秋觉 得这地方似乎有些眼熟，随口道： “ 绝世黄瓜。 ” “ 绝世黄瓜？ ” 纱华铃喃喃道，旋即大怒： “ 你取笑我吗？！ ” 沈清秋越看越觉得，这地方他就算没来过，也至少听过描述，自顾自想着下一步打算 ，直接忽视了纱华铃。 她见得不到回应，气哼哼地道： “ 不管你从前是什么来历，既然已经饮下天魔之血， 今后就是君上的人了。如有逆反之心，死无全尸，都算是轻的下场。 ” 等到转了个弯，路过几名身穿熟悉的淡黄色衣衫的弟子，沈清秋终于确定了。 这里是幻花宫。洛冰河在人界的大本营。 可是和他认知里的幻花宫差别太大了。 幻花宫应该是富丽堂皇，金碧辉煌的。一木一石，都极尽奢华之能事。可眼下这个地 方，只能用一个词来形容。 死气沉沉。 历代宫主都喜好铺张，洛冰河也不例外。只是他所铺张的，是黑暗。连长廊两侧的灯 盏，都是将熄不熄的模样。 纱华铃一转眼就换了一身幻花宫弟子的服饰，不刻意散发魔气，看起来和普通的美貌 少女没什么区别。两人远远跟着洛冰河神游一般穿过层层厅堂，在一间主殿中落座。 须臾便有弟子上殿来报事，拜在座下，恭恭敬敬道： “ 宫主。您离开期间，那柳清歌 又来过两次。没见到您，一次砸了菱花部，一次挑了瑾花部。 ” 沈清秋听得心中一紧。 柳清歌这 …… 该不会是在给他报仇吧？ 对这位师弟，沈清秋自觉坑得已经够多了，心想回头一定得找个机会，和他通通气。 洛冰河道： “ 让他砸。还有吗？ ” 这种 “ 无所谓，老子钱多 ” 的有恃无恐！ 那弟子看他一眼，小心翼翼道： “ 还有就是 …… 小宫主 …… 要见您。 ” 沈清秋原本以为洛冰河会一脸宠溺地宣爱妃上殿，谁知他还是一张爱理不理的面孔。 似乎连话都不想多说，只是疲惫地摆了摆手。 那弟子为难道： “ 可是 ……” “ 可是我已经来了！ ” 沈清秋一听这声音就牙疼皮肉疼。 小宫主已经闯入殿中。沈清秋只瞥了瞥，略感意外。 这姑娘这时应当仍是个如花少女的年纪，可看上去竟有几分憔悴之色。脸上那一点绯 红，似乎都是脂粉堆出来的。 小宫主昂头直视洛冰河： “ 你回来了。 ” 洛冰河看了她一眼，没有说话。 小宫主问： “ 你找到我爹爹了吗。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 老宫主归隐云游，不见行踪。 ” 这回答简直太标准太没有诚意了。 而且，在沈清秋的印象和各种电视剧小说的默认常识中，坐在宝座上说出这句话的人 ，一般就是让前任领导 “ 不见行踪 ” 的罪魁祸首。 小宫主冷笑一声： “ 又是这句。好，我不提爹爹，就单提我自己。 ” 她尖声说道： “ 我不去找你，你就不来看我吗？ ” 怎么可能！ 洛冰河是那种放着妹子不去推的暴殄天物之徒？！ 不要侮辱一个种马文的男主，那是他的尊严！ 洛冰河显然没打算要这种尊严。几名幻花宫弟子迎上殿来，看似劝慰，实际上则是强 行架住小宫主往外拖。她沿路大吼大叫，纱华铃道： “ 小宫主这些年来锦衣玉食半分不少 ，除了偶尔禁足，似乎也不曾受过什么亏待吧？怎么就如此委屈了？ ” 小宫主道： “ 你是什么东西？也敢在幻花宫这样对我说话？！他这样对我，跟养着一 头猪有什么区别？！ ” 沈清秋以前对于女主掐架，都是抱着一种敬而远之的围观心态，今天却没心情围观 了。 他发现了一个很令人震惊的现状。 掰掰手指，认真算算： 纱华铃：没收做老婆，反而收作了属下，累死累活，而且工资待遇什么的，实在不咋 样x 柳溟烟：连定情之物剑穗都没交换 x 宁婴婴：过了青春期之后，就没再表现出年少无知时期对男主的狂热爱恋。恋爱脑似 乎自动痊愈了 x 小宫主：自己都说了洛冰河只把她当猪在养 x 秋海棠：说好了拉把沈清秋拉下马后就和洛冰河一起愉快地 ntr 呢 x 秦婉约： …… 秦婉约在哪儿呢？幻花宫里她应该是主场之一啊？ x 三个道姑：影子都没见到。如果见到了的话，根本就不需要沈清秋来做引渡容器了 xxx …… 这么看来，洛冰河真的 …… 混的相当之惨啊！ 堂堂种马文男主，你究竟还行不行了？！ 好好的后宫，被他折腾得乌烟瘴气！ 沈清秋连忙敲系统去检查数值。他蓦地发现， b 格这一行，居然飙到了 900 多！ 因为似乎许多数值都是在休眠和离线状态期间加的，所以没有收到提示音。沈清秋戳 开积分明细（什么时候居然多了积分明细这个东西），里面排着一堆历史记录。 【宁婴婴：反倒贴。 b 格 +100 】 【明帆：反配角智障。 b 格 +50 】 【柳溟烟：反解除。 b 格 +150 】 …… 无处不在的倒贴女主、以及智障炮灰，这两点是构成种马雷文的经典元素。现在女性 角色不倒贴男主了，配角双 q 貌似也提高了，所以 b 格自然提升了。这个沈清秋明白。 但是洛冰河一个妞都没泡到，系统居然也没扣他爽度，这点不科学！ 难道说现在男主的爽度已经不是绑定在他身上了？ 或者说，男主的 “ 爽 ” ，已志不在此了？ 这 …… 沈清秋忍不住抬眼望向表情阴郁的洛冰河，忽然有种无法直视的感觉。 罪过啊罪过，难道他把好好一个种马文男主 …… 养成了 x 冷淡吗？！","CHAPTER 48: NOT KNOWING THEY’VE MET BY CHANCE Sha Hualing didn’t understand why Luo Binghe would suddenly react with such fury. Though she struggled to hold back her tears, they escaped in rapid currents down her face, blurring her vision. As she tried to figure out what she had done to be punished, she happened to look at Shen Qingqiu’s face. Suddenly, her expression looked as if she had seen a ghost. Terrified, she shrieked, “My lord, forgive me! This subordinate knows her wrong, but this subordinate swears that it was all a coincidence! My lord, forgive me, it really wasn’t me who did this!” Sha Hualing’s heart was extremely bitter since she already had a black mark on her record. Back when she was first recruited by Luo Binghe to serve under him, she had seen the way that he treated Shen Qingqiu’s body and had a vague impression of what it meant to him. Thus, fancying herself clever, she managed to find someone who looked around fifty-percent similar to Shen Qingqiu. Using one of the demon race’s techniques, she eventually managed to make the fake look exactly like the real, to the point where it was almost a perfect copy. She proudly presented the copy to Luo Binghe, not expecting that not only was he not pleased, he also went into a rage and almost destroyed the entire cave. Sha Hualing would never forget that moment and naturally didn’t want to see Luo Binghe with that expression ever again. From then on she was always cautious, never daring to broach the topic in any way. Who knew that the vessel she was eyeing now would actually resemble Shen Qingqiu by quite a bit? This no doubt enraged Luo Binghe’s wrath! Luo Binghe said, “Didn’t I warn you not to get any ideas about using this face?” Sha Hualing was suspended in the air. Her face turned red from the lack of oxygen, and she could only make choking noises again and again. With great difficulty, she managed to say, “This time… it really wasn’t this subordinate’s plan…” Although Shen Qingqiu wasn’t very clear on the details, he could guess that the matter had something to do with that face of his. He closed his mouth, thinking to himself: He has been dead for five years, and yet Luo Binghe stillbecomes angry when he sees someone who resembles him. It looks like l deeply traumatized Luo Binghe that time. Suddenly, Shen Qingqiu felt a sharp pain in his stomach. It was as if a thousand needles were threading through his internal organs. Even if he had an abundant amount of spiritual energy now, it was useless. His eyesight darkened as he spat out a warm mouthful of bright red blood. The air pressure around Luo Binghe’s body was extremely heavy. He looked at Shen Qingqiu as if he were staring down at a dead animal. The Heart Devil sword on his waist began to shudder with excitement, buzzing without end, as if it would tumble out of its scabbard at any moment. With one hand, Luo Binghe forcefully pressed down on the sword hilt, his eyes overflowing with a blood red color. Shen Qingqiu wiped away the blood on the sides of his face, staring at the scene blankly. In the original course of events, Luo Binghe should have adjusted to a relatively balanced mental state after entering the demonic world. Every month he would absorb the cultivation of one or two people, only taking in more for the purpose of strengthening himself. But why did Shen Qingqiu feel that Luo Binghe’s current state of being was becoming increasingly worse? It was even more violent than when he had so helpfully detonated his soul to suppress the Heart Devil sword’s influence. Sha Hualing was being hoisted higher and higher into the air. Seeing Shen Qingqiu spit out blood, she knew that Luo Binghe had steeled his heart and was currently manipulating his body’s Heavenly Demon blood. With all her might, she yelled, “My lord… you must not kill him… today is the full moon. He will definitely be usefulthere is no one more suitable than him…” Of course, she wasn’t actually concerned about Shen Qingqiu living or dying. Rather, if she allowed Luo Binghe to lose himself in his fury and take this strange person’s life, she would definitely suffer even if he didn’t lose himself to his demon side. Thinking about this, Sha Hualing felt that she must have been born under an ill star. As sincerely as she could, she hoarsely shouted, “Even if you don’t care about this person, or about me, at least think about… think about that…” She used all her effort to raise her voice on the final phrase: “Think about the Holy Mausoleum!” Hearing the last two words, Luo Binghe’s movements instantly became sluggish.The Holy Mausoleum was the eternal resting place of the demon race’s elders. No one was allowed to enter except for the current ruler; any violators were met with death. As generations passed, all sorts of magic weapons and spirit tools were buried as funerary objects within the mausoleum. Not only were they countless in number, but the quality was of a rare sort unable to found anywhere else, enough to make anyone drool at the thought. It was also rumored that within the mausoleum, there was an item that was able to raise a person from the dead. The original Luo Binghe, with Sha Hualing’s help, achieved the premier position and entered the Holy Mausoleum. There was no question as to whose bag all those rare items ended up in. By bringing up the Holy Mausoleum, wasn’t Sha Hualing reminding Luo Binghe that he couldn’t dispose of her yet? In any case, she was clearly on the right track. Hearing the last two words, Luo Binghe’s eyes flashed with a red light. Sha Hualing’s body slammed downwards until her toes were barely touching the ground. “You’ve reminded me.” Luo Binghe’s fingers gently stroked the Heart Devil sword, comforting the restless blade. Lowering his voice, he said, “That’s right, there’s still the Holy Mausoleum.” Sha Hualing was finally about to breathe when she heard Luo Binghe ask, “So you’re threatening me?” Her soul nearly flew out of her body in terror. “This subordinate doesn’t dare!” Too tragic. How had one of the two domineering female leads of the Proud Immortal Demon Way , ranking top three for the most popular (female) character for years on end, been reduced to this state! Shen Qingqiu didn’t even have a chance to lament before he felt someone grab his chest, dragging his body forward. His eyes became blurry. A sudden freezing feeling emanated over his upper torso. When he lowered his head to look, one of Luo Bing’s hands were pressing against the left side of his chest. It felt like he had been shot in the chest, the ammunition being the sinister demonic energy. After entering his body, the energy spread through his veins and extended to all four of his limbs. The system’s sudden, lucid beep distracted him from the pain. Touch verification successful!The power source has been connected. Storing power! System self-evaluation: all system operations normal. Thank you for your continued usage! Wasn’t this system inspection a bit too advanced? The original spirit energy in Shen Qingqiu was akin to a full pond. This time, a good amount had been sucked away by Luo Binghe. But this emptiness lasted only for a second. The body formed from the Sun and Moon Dew Flower Seed quickly began to gather spiritual energy, replacing the missing energy taken away by Luo Binghe. Shen Qingqiu felt that his current body was like a power bank. Inwardly, he roared: So maybe in my previous life I might have been too excessive with some of my novel reviews, but the things I blasted were all about Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky’s writing ability, and never anything against the actual male lead! So why is Luo Binghe always getting involved with me? Luo Binghe made an exclamation of surprise, withdrawing his hand. This meat vessel was unlike any of the vessels he had used before. Though he had already extracted most of the spiritual energy away and infused it with a huge volume of demonic energy, it appeared that it was able to regenerate quickly. It looked like Sha Hualing’s insistence on capturing this person had its merits. Sha Hualing fell onto the floor with a loud bang. She knew she had made the right decision in capturing this person and probably escaped death by a narrow margin, passing by a great tribulation. Still, she was extremely terrified, unable to stop her knees from shaking. She hurriedly attempted to straighten her posture as she knelt on one knee. Luo Binghe said, “I don’t care if this really was something that you did. But remember that I don’t want to ever see him using this face.” Sha Hualing hurriedly lowered her head. “As you say!” Luo Binghe raised his hand and sliced open a rift in the space in front of him, stepping through it. His arrogant way of leaving was enough to make most people furious. The two of them were left behind inside of the barren wasteland just like that as if Luo Binghe didn’t care if Shen Qingqiu tried to run away or not. But then again, there was no need for him to worry. Shen Qingqiu had already ingested his blood, so if he tried to flee, Luo Binghe only had to flick a finger to find Shen Qingqiu’s whereabouts and cause him a pain worse than death.Shen Qingqiu had a sudden thought: so… he could be considered to be this Big Brother Bing’s follower? Of course, Luo Binghe hadn’t officially acknowledged him. But if he played his cards right, did that mean that it was possible his future prospects were looking hopeful? Wasn’t it only a once-a-month matter? After a while, he would basically be accustomed to it! As his thoughts whirled about in frenetic chaos, Sha Hualing suddenly grabbed at his face. Shen Qingqiu extended two fingers, blocking her. “What are you trying to do?” Sha Hualing gnashed her teeth. “Didn’t you hear him? He just said that he didn’t want to see your face!” Shen Qingqiu stared at her blankly. Out of the blue, he reached out an arm and tore a piece of muslin off of her robe. Sha Hualing shrieked, “Why are you tearing at my robes?” Then Qingqiu tore two holes through the fabric, pressing it against his face so that it revealed only his eyes. “My robes have too many holes, so I can only use yours. Do you only know how to tear apart a person’s face? Using a piece of fabric is enough. There’s no need for disfigurement.” If it wasn’t for the fact that Luo Binghe needed to use this person once a month, meaning that every hair on his head was to remain intact, Sha Hualing would have long hacked him into mincemeat. But then again, just because Luo Binghe despised seeing fake versions of that face didn’t mean that he would enjoy seeing a shredded, bloody appearance either. Sha Hualing could only swallow her anger, yelling, “Let’s go!” If they were going then they were going. Either way, wherever they ended up in didn’t matter; it wasn’t worth calculating every step. Shen Qingqiu deduced that after Luo Binghe successfully suppressed the Heart Devil sword, there would be no need for him anymore. At that point, he could say goodbye to the cultivation world, which probably wouldn’t be an event too far into the future. As long as he was careful, it would be fine as long as Luo Binghe didn’t realize that his soul had escaped into the Sun and Moon Dew Flower Seed’s fake body. Shen Qingqiu’s adaptation to his new role was fairly quick. He followed after Luo Binghe into the crack, and with Sha Hualing bringing up the rear, the crack slowly disappearing afterward. The adjustment speed of the Demon race’s most outstanding general could also be considered quite excellent; after a fewbreaths, Sha Hualing was completely calm. She asked, “What’s your name?” The other side of the crack led to a long hallway. On both walls, complicated engravings could be seen, with all kinds of patterns carved into them. It was just that the lighting was a bit too dim. Shen Qingqiu felt that this place was somewhat familiar. Without thinking, he replied, “Peerless Cucumber.” Sha Hualing muttered, “Peerless Cucumber?” Soon after, she angrily demanded, “Are you making fun of me?” The more Shen Qingqiu stared at the carvings, the more he was sure that even if he had never personally seen the patterns before, it was possible to deduce where he was from a previous description of it. In the process, he completely ignored Sha Hualing. Seeing that she was met with no response, Sha Hualing furiously threatened him, “No matter what your previous history was since you’ve drunk the Heavenly Demon’s blood you are one of the lord’s people now. If you have any contrary thoughts about him, dying without an intact corpse can be considered a light punishment!” When he turned a corner, which revealed several followers dressed in familiar yellow robes, Shen Qingqiu finally realized where he was: the Huan Hua Palace, Luo Binghe’s headquarters in the human realm. But this place was too different from the Huan Hua Palace that he recognized. The Huan Hua Palace was supposed to be majestic and splendorous, dazzling the eyes with luxury. Every wooden plank and stone was made from the most lavish materials. But the building in front of his eyes could be described with one word: Lifeless. The rulers of the previous dynasties had always loved extravagance and Luo Binghe was no exception. However, the supposed luxury was now a bleak dimness. Even the lanterns that lined the corridor flickered as if they would be extinguished any moment. In a moment, Sha Hualing had changed into the same robes as the rest of the Huan Hua Palace followers. Unable to release demonic energy, she looked the same as any other good-looking human girl. Luo Binghe passed through the halls, taking a seat inside a large palace chamber. Shen Qingqiu had originally wanted to wander somewhere else, only to be stopped by Sha Hualing: “Where are you going? Don’t wander away. Staywith me!” Shen Qingqiu didn’t want to go against her, and could only reluctantly stand rigidly beside her with the other followers, arranged in straight lines. Shortly after, a follower stood up to deliver his report. Several other followers also followed suit, paying respects and deferentially reporting current events. Shen Qingqiu absentmindedly listened to what was being spoken, until the mention of a familiar name pricked into him. A follower said, “Palace Lord, when you left, that Liu Qingge came over two times. Seeing that you weren’t here, he smashed all of the water caltrop blossoms.” Hearing this, Shen Qingqiu’s heart became anxious and his teeth ached slightly. Liu Qingge, he… was he trying to take revenge for him? Luo Binghe’s face was filled with a “Who cares, this old man has plenty of money” kind of security. “Let him smash them. What else?” The follower looked at him, wiping away his cold sweat. Cautiously, he added, “Also… the Young Palace Mistress… wants to meet with you.” Originally, Shen Qingqiu had thought that Luo Binghe would wear a tender and affectionate expression as he declared his love to his concubine to the entire palace hall. Who knew that instead, a cold and standoffish expression appeared instead. As if he was too exhausted to even speak, he waved his hand, rejecting the subject. That follower was put in a hard situation. “But…” “But I’ve already arrived!” When he heard this voice, Shen Qingqiu’s teeth and skin ached. Faster than could be said, the Young Palace Mistress’s fiery temper shone through as she charged into the palace. By her side, in a similar yellow robe, was a slightly older beauty. Her eyes were hazy, as if tears would spill out any moment. This person was none other than Qin Wanyue. Shen Qingqiu stared at the two of them, feeling that this development was rather unexpected. These two girls should have been in the blossoming stages of their youth, yet they both looked pale and haggard. It was especially evident on the Young Palace Mistress, whose unevenly distributed red patches on her cheeks were most likely artificially created through cosmetics. Why was it that she didn’t even look half like a young mistress spoiled with luxury by her lover?The Young Palace Mistress lifted her head to look at Luo Binghe. “You’ve returned.” Luo Binghe stared at her, silent. Qin Wanyue quietly said, “Young Palace Mistress, let’s go back.” The Young Palace Mistress sharply said to her, “Do you think I don’t know who you think about day and night? The reason you endure by my side, why you’ll do anything, isn’t it all to catch a glimpse of him? Why is it then when you actually see him you pretend to be lovable and pitiable? Why was it that before I came here you made no efforts to stop me, and yet only advise me now?” Qin Wanyue lowered her head, not daring to say anything else. Her ears flushed a dark red. The Young Palace Mistress once again turned to the palace hall. “Have you found my father yet?” Luo Binghe said, “The Old Palace Master has disappeared into the clouds. There’s no trace of him anymore.” This reply was really too insincere. In Shen Qingqiu’s impression, gleaned from several television dramas and webnovels, the “I don’t know his whereabouts” person who typically said that line that was almost certainly the chief culprit who had orchestrated the former leader’s disappearance. The Young Palace Mistress coldly sneered, “It’s this phrase again. Could it be you don’t even have the energy to think of a new excuse to give me? Alright, I won’t mention Father. Let’s talk about me.” She shrilly demanded, “If I didn’t come and find you, would you have looked for me?” Was Luo Binghe the kind of brute who would go around push around a sister? Don’t insult his dignity as the male lead of a stallion novel! But it was a pity that Luo Binghe had apparently forsaken this dignity. A few Huan Hua Palace followers appeared onto the palace steps, looking as if they were going to console her, only to forcibly push the Young Palace Mistress outside. As she was dragged out she continuously screamed and yelled, Qin Wanyue awkwardly following her at the side. From time to time she would cast a teary glance at Luo Binghe, as if expecting something. Sha Hualing, who had previously been standing straight and at full attention, now wrinkled her eyebrows and followed them outside. Standing on the veranda, she berated them, “What are you guys doing? When I told you towatch her you consider this your job done?”"
"“……” 沈清秋蹲在这片熟悉的苍茫荒原上 , 深深叹了口气。 他说： “ 为什么，究竟是为什么，我又被拉进来了？ ” 系统：【您目前所在地点：洛冰河的梦境之地。】 沈清秋抱头： “ 这个问题我似乎很早就问过你了，但我还是想再问一次：这里是哪不重要 ，重要的是，我为什么会在这里？ ” 好吧 , 原因其实他也差不多知道了。 在洛冰河意识不稳定、波动极大的时候 , 往往会有旁人遭受波及 , 被卷进他庞大如深海漩涡 的梦境。 或者说 , 被他巨大无比的脑洞给坑了。具体情况 , 参见当初梦魔副本的起始。 沈清秋跟他走过一回梦魔副本。所谓一回生二回熟 , 这跟连了一次 wifi 后第二次就不用输密 码自动连接了，也是差不多的道理。 目前能想到最好的解决办法 , 就是找个位置，坐等洛冰河自己醒过来。 沈清秋慢吞吞站起来，摸摸自己的脸。 梦境中恢复了原本的容貌。习惯之后，再一摸脸上没有胡子，还真有些不自在。 竹林飒飒，幽风习习。 沈清秋根本不用怀疑，这地方哪怕只露一个边角给他，也能知道这是哪儿。 苍穹山，清静峰。 这辈子他窝得最久的地方，能不熟悉吗？ 还有沿路三三两两走过的弟子们，他们的脸和身上的服色，沈清秋更不会不认识。 沈清秋是外界入侵者，和这些 “ 人 ” 不在一个频道，像个幽灵一样盯着他们看。这些往往来 来的弟子们虽然表情略显木讷，但的确都有鼻子有脸，而且为数不少沈清秋都能叫出名 字。 连梦魔都无法在支撑庞大结界的同时做到保证里面的生物带有五官，洛冰河居然已经能够 做到了。而且精致到如此地步。 转出小竹林后，就是清静竹舍。 高低错落有致的竹檐之间，泉水飞流，折射出阳光七色，叮叮如律。 一阵踏碎落叶的轻盈足音，走出一个十五六岁的白衣少年。 这少年肤色白皙，似乎是一路小跑过来的，额头起了一层薄汗，脸颊红扑扑的，身为可爱 ，眼角眉峰线条明晰而不锐利，青涩之味扑面而来。 沈清秋忍不住感慨：好久没见到这么小清新的阳光少年洛冰河了。 他在清静峰修行期间，喜好穿白衣。而逆反之后的混世魔王洛冰河只穿黑衣，和以往一切 几乎彻底颠倒。这种青葱的鲜嫩模样，更是完全看不到了。 他正步走来，整了整衣角，垂头叫道： “ 师尊。 ” 沈清秋知道，他看不见自己，这一声自然不是在叫他。缓缓转身，果然见一袭青衫，立在 翠叶掩映中。 那张脸，不是沈清秋自己又是谁？ 这由梦境记忆衍生的 “ 沈清秋 ” 这么站在一片青翠欲滴的竹林中，身形清癯，也仿佛一支修 竹。神色淡定，仙气泠然，单用眼睛看，还真有几分遗世风姿的味道。 现在沈清秋作为旁观者，让他评头论足一番，也不得不折服。 这装 b 装的，到这个境界，太够味了！ 洛冰河能把种种细节完美地还原出来，也真不愧是梦魔亲传！ 那竹林中似正在出神的沈清秋偏了偏头，道： “ 跑完了？ ” 洛冰河点头道： “ 十圈 …… 跑完了。 ” 沈清秋终于想起了这是哪一段了。 洛冰河说的 “ 十圈 ” ，指的是绕着清静峰的环篱跑十圈。沈清秋亲自给他布置的任务。 这可不是他恶趣味地对男主大大进行体罚，而是忍无可忍。 自从他接手洛冰河之后，琢磨着既然为人师表，怎么也得教点实在的东西，日后翻脸，好 歹提到 “ 师徒之情、授业之恩 ” 这八个字时，不至于话未出口、老脸先红。 第一步就要改正他乱七八糟的走位和身法。 至于教学成果，很早就说过了。最大的成果就是洛冰河往他怀里撞了半个月。 沈清秋道： “ 再来。这次再没对，就不只是十圈了。 ” 洛冰河便听话地再来了，于是，这次，洛冰河倒是没撞他，而是脚底一歪，直接抱住了沈 清秋的腰。 沈清秋： “……” 洛冰河腼腆道： “ 师尊，徒儿没用，跑完十圈，脚软了。 ” 沈清秋叹了口气。 洛冰河自觉道： “ 弟子知道。二十圈。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 圈什么圈？回房休息去吧。 ” 他真没有虐童的爱好。当时真是自暴自弃了。爱咋样咋样吧！ 不教了，一点成就感也没有，摔教材！ 洛冰河浑然不觉自己被嫌弃了，还兴高采烈道： “ 谢师尊！二十圈明天弟子一定会补上 的。今晚有什么想吃的吗？ ” 沈清秋在一旁抹了一把额头。 当年的洛冰河 …… 真他妈是个小可爱啊！ 任劳任怨任打任骂给骑给踹给做饭 …… 咳咳，当然这些大部分沈清秋是没有做过的。 同时，他也纳闷起来了。 在洛冰河给自己创造的梦境结界中，他当然只会选取自己觉得美好的记忆。如果清静峰的 记忆能占一席之地，那也应该是和宁婴婴相关的才对。 为什么会有这一段？ 梦境能最直接地反映人心最真实的一面，不会作虚假伪装。 沈清秋油然而生一种他从没动过的念头。 虽然这么有点显得脸大，不过 …… 大概、也许、说不定，这段师徒之情，在洛冰河心中的 地位，比沈清秋想象的要高那么一点。 不过另外一点，沈清秋却能肯定： 洛冰河绝对是抖 m 没跑！ 一般谁会把自己被罚跑十圈二十圈的记忆特地放到梦境结界里的！？ 沈清秋正想走进那片还原度极高的竹舍里去，忽然，脖颈蔓延上丝丝寒气，感觉有一道又 冷又热的视线定在身上。 他猛地回头。 黑衣的洛冰河正抱着手，虚靠着一只青竹，凝视着他。 我靠，本尊！ 沈清秋第一反应，不是拔腿就跑，而是原地不动，把脸上表情调节到最自然。 这个结界是洛冰河的主场，跑得再快也没用。 “ 跑 ” 根本不能解决问题。 刚才那道又冷又热的视线，不是错觉，也不是他形容有误。洛冰河的眼神，真的是像冰又 像火，森寒有之，炙热有之，牢牢锁在他身上。 沈清秋硬着头皮与他四目相对。 半晌，还是洛冰河先叹了口气。 他喃喃道： “ 会做梦，也是好的很。 ” 听到这一句，沈清秋暂时定了心。 他大着胆子，居然赌赢了一把。洛冰河此刻神思恍惚，真的把他当成自己一手造出来的梦 境产物了。 沈清秋见他倚着竹子，怔怔凝视自己，单形只影，想到他白天时坐在首座上的情形，再对 比原著一呼百应、花团锦簇的光景，忍不住有些可怜。 一个嘘寒问暖的老婆都没有。太惨了。 堂堂种马文男主，沦落到这个地步。哪个男人都不忍心看啊。 洛冰河道： “ 师尊，你和我说句话吧。 ” 沈清秋此刻心中充满了对男主不幸遭遇的同情，和颜悦色道： “ 好啊。 ” 没想到，他开口说了，洛冰河反倒愣住了，一下子站直，有点不可置信的模样。 糟糕。 是不是推测的反应不对头？ 可既然已经开演了，那就得演到底，沈清秋微微一笑，道： “ 不是你让为师和你说话的 吗？ ” 是啊，快说，说完了就起床，放我出去 …… 洛冰河走了上来，沈清秋强忍冲动，这才没和他保持开适当距离。 洛冰河默然片刻，道： “ 以往师尊都是看也不看我一眼，自顾自走掉，更别提和我说话了 …… 我今天是不是想的有些太美了。 ” 沈清秋满脸黑线。 难道以往洛冰河脑补出来的 “ 沈清秋 ” 都是对他爱理不理高贵冷艳的吗？ 是得有多抖 m 啊？！突破天际了！ 虽然总感觉哪里怪怪的，不过这话听着，还真有点儿心酸。而且，貌似洛冰河对他，真的 仇恨值没那么深。 沈清秋还没来得及细想，洛冰河已经欺到了身前。他表情一凝，心想，这是不是有点太近 了？ 一低头，洛冰河左手捏住了他左腕。 再抬头，右腕也被牢牢抓住。 接下来，沈清秋感觉眼前一花。脸颊像被羽毛轻柔地擦过。 嘴唇上传来陌生的触感，柔软又温凉。 他就这么瞪着眼睛，和洛冰河那双黑沉沉的眸子对视。喉结艰难地上下滚动了一回。 他想说话，却没法开口。 因为嘴被人咬住了。 洛冰河闭上眼睛，黑漆漆的长睫毛在脸颊投下弯弯的阴影，看起来十分之乖巧，可动作上 却完全不是这么回事。他松开手，改为扶上沈清秋的腰心，往自己怀里压过去。 沈清秋被他压在胸膛前，浑身僵硬。三观以光速不断毁灭重塑毁灭重塑循环中。 明明两个人身影相差不大，他却能被洛冰河用环抱的姿势一手揽住。 打破他崩坏状态的，是一条伴着欢庆 bgm 的系统提示：【爽度 +500 ！恭喜！恭喜！恭喜！ （重要的事情说三遍）】 沈清秋咆哮： “ 我次嗷哦啊哦啊哦  ！ ” 他总算是明白，为什么洛冰河一个妞都没推倒，后宫三千佳丽连个毛影子都没见到，爽度 却一直没被拉下来了！！！ 草草草因为他用自己补足了爽度啊啊啊！！！ 猛地明白真相的沈清秋又是惊悚又是悲愤，抬脚就踹！ 洛冰河被不闪也不躲，生生被他踢了个正着，一步也没退，看上去又生气又委屈，问道： “ 做梦也不行吗？ ” 你委屈个毛线啊？！？！ 你快醒醒！这虽然是在做梦，可劳资不是你做出来的啊！！！ 一巴掌拍醒他不行，任由他继续稀里糊涂下去也不行！！！ 这才是真正的左右都是死！！！ 沈清秋还没继续咆哮点什么来平复一下情绪，猝不及防，背部撞上青竹，被洛冰河一把摁 在上面。洛冰河一低头，又压了下来。 这次不是软绵绵地亲了，简直是在叼着他啃！ 沈清秋不是没被人亲过，可第一次有这种对方随时会狂性大发把他上下两片嘴唇咬掉的恐 怖感觉。凌乱的呼吸间隙中，洛冰河低声道： “ 师尊，我错了 ……” 你他妈这像是知道自己错了的样子吗？！ 他才是错了，真的错了，错的彻底！ 什么叫空穴不来风？！ 江湖八卦都是有科学根据的。每一个八卦人士上辈子都是折翼的天使能够透过现象看到本 质！ 他没把男主养成 x 冷淡，也不是抖 m 不抖 m 的问题！真相比它们更可怕，他把男主养成了 基佬啊啊啊啊啊！！！ 难怪他不要女主！！！ 女人已经不能引起他的兴趣不跟他的爽度挂钩了！！！ 疯了！！！ 沈清秋正在考虑要不要再自爆一次，突然，洛冰河放开了他。 他望了望头顶那片漩涡云状的天空，阴沉沉地道： “ 该死。 ” 该死是说这次瞄准他关键部位准备踹的沈清秋吗？ 他还没来得及施行这一自卫计划，眼前场景和人像刹那溃散，幻化为万千碎片。同时，沈 清秋在幻花宫主殿的屋顶上一跃而起。 这才是真实的世界。 沈清秋剧烈地呼吸一阵，好容易定住心神，忽然惊觉，主殿之下火光四起，告警的钟声响 成一片。 他探出头去，衣摆在夜风中翻卷不休，从上而下俯瞰，无数幻花宫弟子正从四面八方涌向 这边。 “ 有人入侵！ ” 沈清秋大喜，入侵最好，趁乱逃跑，管他什么天魔血，都比不上节操重要！先走再说，再 见！ 结果他还没飞出两步，又听人喊： “ 往幻花阁那边去了，是柳清歌！是百战峰峰主又来了！ ” 沈清秋脚底一滑，立马转身折了回来。 要命！偏偏柳清歌在这种时候来了，总不能撇下他扔给已经完全崩坏掉的洛冰河不管吧？ 幻花阁是历代宫主修炼和息居之地，离这里不远。沈清秋三两步跳下屋顶，随着大部队赶 去。 还没跨入幻花宫，阵阵逼人寒气迎面袭来。从里面传来一声震耳欲聋的暴喝。 “ 滚！ ” 一众听到告警钟声、不明就里的弟子闯进了门，前排数十人都被一波强劲至极的气浪掀 飞。 沈清秋在后一拨人人里，刚好闪过这一击，挑了个好位置，浑水摸鱼摸了进去。刚一进门 ，就被冻得起了一层鸡皮疙瘩。 整个幻花阁，变成了一个巨大的冰窟，踏入一步，就像踏入了冰天雪地。沈清秋衣袖衣袍 里都灌满冷风，背心额头的冷汗迅速冻结成薄冰，可想而知，屋子里冷到什么地步了。 非但温度奇低，四面墙壁都被封的严严实实，门窗密不透风，又冷又暗，若不是被入侵者 强行破开了一个大口，简直像一具冰制的棺椁。 阁室中央的坐化台上，帷幔半遮半掩，几件黑黑白白的外衣凌乱地堆在台边。 洛冰河身上只穿了一件中衣，一副刚从床上爬起的模样，衣衫不整，领口歪敞，黑发披散 ，面色异常苍白，嘴唇却是鲜红的，眸中两点冷光闪烁，鬼气逼人。锋芒毕露，正是备战 状态。 他正对面七步之处，柳清歌握剑的手骨暴凸，整张脸都是铁青色。 柳清歌盯着坐化台旁的洛冰河，一字一句道： “ 你这杂种。 ” 他每说一个字，乘鸾剑上灵光便杀气腾腾暴起一阵。 沈清秋警觉地注视着双方，然而，只看了一眼柳清歌剑指的方向，脑海中传来最后一丝负 隅顽抗的三观彻底碎掉的声音。 洛冰河右手放在从不离身的心魔剑上，雪白的剑身已出鞘小半截；左手里，却还搂着个 人。 这具身体毫无生气，头部垂下，肢体无力，却十分柔软。也穿着单薄的中衣，衣领滑到肩 下，半个惨白如纸的背部都露了出来。","CHAPTER 49: TRUE DISPOSITION Shen Qingqiu had always kept himself at a respectful distance when it came to the tussles and catfights between the female characters. But when he saw what was happening, he felt the gap between his expectations and reality was too great, so he hurriedly followed to continue spectating. Qin Wanyue held back her tears: “I’m sorry, I neglected my duty and did not stop the Little Palace Mistress…” Sha Hualing immediately interrupted her: “It was your fault in the first place! I heard that women of the human realm are particularly modest and moral, but how many times have you failed to seduce the lord yet still refuse to leave? If you don’t leave that’s fine, but you’re incapable of looking after even a single person. Her cultivation isn’t even as high as yours. You’re her senior martial sister. You didn’t stop her early and didn’t stop her late. All you did was to let her make this unreasonable scene in front of the lord. Who are you putting on this pitiful and wronged appearance for?” Hearing Sha Hualing point out all her weaknesses in front of her face, Qin Wanyue was so ashamed she wanted to die. Back in the original novel, Sha Hualing held an extreme hatred for Qin Wanyue and always found ways to quarrel with her. It seemed that although the two had not entered the harem together this time, their relationship had not improved by the slightest. Sha Hualing turned away and changed the expression on her face, now looking at the Little Palace Mistress with a face full of smiles: “The Little Palace Mistress has been living a life of luxury all these years just like before. Aside from being occasionally grounded, it seems you have never suffered any mistreatment, right? Why are you now so aggrieved?” The Little Palace Mistress ferociously replied: “And what the hell are you? A seductive wild fox of a demon who came from who-knows-where, actually daring to talk to me like this in the Huan Hua Palace? What’s the difference between how he treats me and how he’d raise a pig?” Sha Hualing stuck out her lip: “Then why doesn’t the Little Palace Mistress tell us: besides eating and sleeping like the animal you mentioned, what else can you do?” Qin Wanyue wept: “Little Palace Mistress, let’s hurry and leave. Everything… has long since changed…” The Little Palace Mistress became completely hysterical: “Why should I leave? This is my Huan Hua Palace, mine! All of you, get lost! Everything’sreversed from how it should be!” The scene was one of utter turmoil and warfare. Shen Qingqiu had discovered an incredibly shocking fact. He used his fingers to carefully calculate: Sha Hualing: Not received as a wife, but as a subordinate instead. Slaving away, working herself to death with all the overtime. Her salary and working conditions were also inhumane. The boss’s attitude suggests that he does not want to engage in office romance × Liu Mingyan: Even the love token sword tassels were not exchanged × Ning Yingying: After puberty, no longer shows the same passionate love for the male protagonist like she did when she was young and ignorant. Lovesick brain seems to have been cured × Little Palace Mistress: Aggrieved woman confined at home. Even said herself that Luo Binghe only treats her like a pig to raise × Qin Wanyue: Aggrieved woman confined at home #2. Numerous attempts at devoting her life and body have all failed. Now a part-time nursemaid for the Little Palace Mistress × Qiu Haitang: Didn’t we already establish that after dragging Shen Qingqiu down, she would happily go NTRing with Luo Binghe? How come she’s still wandering around outside, travel-worn? × Three Taoist nuns: Cameos as short-lived as the night-blooming cactus, hello goodbye ××× Looking at it from this perspective, Luo Binghe really… is doing quite miserably! Dignified Stallion novel male protagonist, are you still okay in that department? A perfectly good harem, tormented by him into complete pandemonium. If this was a novel, how could coolness points even be in the conversation without having received even a single wife? Shen Qingqiu hurriedly knocked on the System to check all the various values. But he suddenly discovered: the B points and coolness value had not only not been reduced, but instead had actually shot up to more than 900! Since many of these values were added during the sleep and offline states, he had not received any notifications for them. Shen Qingqiu poked open all the narrow windows that he didn’t know when he had received. Lined up inside was a pile of historical records.Ning Yingying: Reversed the female character’s brainless pursuit. B points +100 Ming Fan: Reversed the supporting character’s illogical mental retardation. B points +50 Liu Mingyan: Reversed the female character’s inexplicable pursuit. B points +150 The ubiquitous pursuing female characters and mentally retarded cannon fodderthese two constituted the classic elements of Stallion novels and the like. Now the female characters did not pursue the male protagonist and the supporting characters’ IQ seemed to have improved, so the B points naturally increased. This Shen Qingqiu understood just fine. But even though Luo Binghe had not hooked up with a single girl, the system did not deduct any of his coolness pointsthis was unscientific! Could it be that the male protagonist’s coolness level was now no longer tied to him? Or in other words, was the male protagonist’s “coolness” no longer here? This… Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but look up at the gloomy Luo Binghe, and suddenly felt like he couldn’t stare straight. Oh no, could it be that he has committed a sin by raising a perfectly good Stallion novel protagonist… into an asexual? With a complicated mood, Shen Qingqiu closed the window. He suddenly realized his location wasn’t quite right. He had clearly just been curiously onlooking in the Huan Hua Palace. How did he unknowingly walk into a bamboo forest? And no matter how he looked at it, it was a quite familiar bamboo forest… The bamboo forest rustled in the gentle serene wind. Shen Qingqiu did not have any doubt. Even if he could see only a small corner of this place, he would be able to tell where this was. Cang Qiong Mountain, Qing Jing Peak. This place where he had lived in for so long… how could he be unfamiliar with it? System: Your current location: Luo Binghe’s dreamscape. When Luo Binghe’s consciousness was unstable and wildly fluctuating, bystanders would often be affected. They would be sucked into this dreamscape as immense as a deep-sea whirlpool. In other words, they would get screwed by falling into his immeasurably vast “brain hole 169 .” See the beginning of theoriginal Dream Demon encounter transcript for details. Shen Qingqiu had previously walked with Luo Binghe through the Dream Demon encounter. This was the so-called “acquired taste 170 .” It was the same as how, after connecting to a WiFi network once, you don’t need to enter the password again when connecting the second time. Shen Qingqiu quickly touched his face and found he had been restored to his original appearance in the dreamscape. His face was no longer bearded, leaving him with no sense of security at all. He was just about to look for a place to hide and wait for Luo Binghe to wake on his own when some disciples came walking along the road in twos and threes. Shen Qingqiu froze in place, and even forget where he had been going to hide. Even though these passersby disciples had slightly wooden and slow expressions, they really did have noses and eyes, their facial features complete. Many of them Shen Qingqiu could even name. Even Dream Demon had no way to support such a huge enchantment while also ensuring the facial features of the creatures inside. Yet Luo Binghe was actually already able to do so and had even shaped their features in such refined detail. Even though he had long since known that Luo Binghe had the talent to cover the heavens and earth, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but let out a sigh of awe. Outside of the small bamboo forest was the Qing Jing bamboo house. Spring water flowed between the staggered bamboo eaves, reflecting the sunlight into seven colors, jingling peacefully and orderly. Shen Qingqiu worried that Luo Binghe was inside, so he stopped his steps and did not go forward. He had passed through this bamboo forest who knows how many times to pass the time, so he routinely found a concealed spot in the shadows to rest. Suddenly, light footsteps sounded on the fallen leaves. From the alternately hidden and visible bamboo emerged a fifteen-year-old white-clothed teenager. This young boy’s complexion was fair, and he seemed to have run all the way over here. His forehead was covered with a thin layer of sweat and his cheeks were flushed red, overall appearing very cute. The lines of his eyes and brows were clear yet not sharp, giving the air of inexperienced freshness. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but lament: It’s been a long time since he last saw such a little fresh sunshine youth Luo Binghe. During his time cultivating at Qing Jing Peak, he liked to wear white clothes. Then after rebelling, the devil king in human form Luo Binghe onlywore black clothes, almost completely reversed from before. This kind of fresh and tender appearance, in particular, could no longer be seen at all. As he strode over, Luo Binghe called out in high spirits: “Shizun!” Shen Qingqiu was hidden in the dark, so this was naturally not directed at him. He turned his gaze and indeed saw someone wearing a green robe standing at the end of the stone-paved road. The “Shen Qingqiu” derived from the dreamscape memories stood amidst the lush green bamboo. His figure was lean and thin, resembling a spiritual bamboo himself. His expression was calm, suffused with the cold and clear air of an immortal. Just looking like this, he really did possess some bearing of gracefulness and unworldliness. As a bystander, the current Shen Qingqiu tried to nit-pick himself and still could not help but be convinced. This acting cool had actually acted all the way to this level, it was truly too tasteful! In the meantime, Luo Binghe was truly worthy of being Dream Demon’s direct heir, to be able to restore every detail to such perfection! That other Shen Qingqiu in the bamboo forest seemed to be in a trance, but then tilted his head: “Finished running?” Luo Binghe nodded his head: “Ten laps… all finished.” Shen Qingqiu finally remembered what event this was. The “ten laps” mentioned by Luo Binghe referred to running ten laps around the fence boundary of Qing Jing Peak. Shen Qingqiu had personally given him this task. This wasn’t because he had the sick sense of humor to punish the great male protagonist, but because he couldn’t take it anymore. Ever since he took over Luo Binghe’s education, he had mulled it over: as the teacher figure, Shen Qingqiu had to somehow teach something real so that when the two of them had their falling-out, he could at least bring up the phrase “affection between teacher and apprentice, grace for bequeathing teachings” without first blushing from shame. According to the general teaching outline, the first step was to correct Luo Binghe’s messy walking position and body technique. As for the results of these teachings… they were mentioned earlier. The biggest achievement was that Luo Binghe rammed into his arms for half a month. Shen Qingqiu said: “Again. If you don’t get it right this time, it won’t be just ten laps.” Luo Binghe obediently tried again. As a result, this time Luo Binghe didnot ram into him. Instead, with a slip of his feet, he directly hugged Shen Qingqiu’s waist. Shen Qingqiu: “…” Luo Binghe bashfully said: “Shizun, this disciple is useless. After running ten laps, my feet are too soft.” Shen Qingqiu sighed. Luo Binghe self-consciously said: “This disciple knows. Twenty laps.” Shen Qingqiu said: “What do you mean, more laps? Go back to your room and rest.” He didn’t have any hobby of child abuse. At that time he had truly given up on himself, doing whatever he felt like doing. He’s not gonna teach anymore, he didn’t get any sense of accomplishment at all, he’s throwing away the textbooks! Luo Binghe totally did not feel he was being avoided, and even became elated: “Thank you, Shizun! This disciple will definitely make up the twenty laps tomorrow. What do you want to eat tonight?” On the side, Shen Qingqiu rubbed his forehead. Luo Binghe back then… was really too silly, sweet, and naive. Enduring labor, resentment, beatings, scoldings; getting taken advantage of, getting kicked, and getting sentenced to making food…. cough cough, of course, Shen Qingqiu had not done most of these things. He watched this artificial master-apprentice pair leave, one tall and one short, the two of them still chatting. Shen Qingqiu then left his hiding place and began to wonder. In the dreamscape enchantment that Luo Binghe created for himself, he would certainly only choose memories he felt were the most beautiful. If the memories of Qing Jing Peak could occupy a place here, they should be related to Ning Yingying. Why would there be this section? Dreamscapes were the most direct reflection of the truest side of a person’s heart, and would not have any false disguises. A thought was spontaneously born in Shen Qingqiu’s mind, one that he had never considered before. Thinking like this seemed a little vain, but… probably… perhaps… just maybe… this section of master-disciple affection was placed a bit higher in Luo Binghe’s heart than Shen Qingqiu had imagined? At the very least, he had still given Luo Binghe some moments that could be reminisced upon. Those times weren’t so bad as to be completely ignored out of disgust.Although… was Luo Binghe a little masochistic? It wasn’t that Shen Qingqiu wanted to badmouth him, but… In general, the memory of getting punished to run ten laps and twenty laps didn’t have any connection to the word “beautiful” no matter how you looked at it, right? Suddenly, a thread of chilly air crept up Shen Qingqiu’s neck, as if there was a both cold and hot line of sight climbing up along his spine. He subconsciously turned his head back. A black-clothed Luo Binghe leaned against a green bamboo, arms crossed and eyes looking directly at him. The two faced each other without words. The man himself? The man himself! Shen Qingqiu’s first reaction wasn’t to take to his heels and start sprinting for it, but to stay in place and adjust his facial expression to his most natural. It wasn’t that he had been scared stupid to the point where his legs turned soft and he couldn’t run. Instead, it was because he had long since made the psychological preparations for this kind of situation. “Running” could not solve the problem at all. This enchantment was Luo Binghe’s home court, so no matter how fast Shen Qingqiu ran it would be useless. That both cold and hot line of sight just now wasn’t an illusion or a mistake in his description. Luo Binghe’s gaze was truly like ice and fire, with both gloomy frigidity and blazing heat. These two temperatures were bizarrely mixed and condensed in his eyes, and firmly locked onto Shen Qingqiu’s body. Shen Qingqiu braced himself and met his gaze. After a long while, it was Luo Binghe who first sighed. He murmured: “Being able to dream… is still nice.” Hearing this sentence, Shen Qingqiu knew his desperate move had succeededhe had successfully passed himself off. He had mustered up his courage and actually won the gamble. At this moment, the entranced and absent-minded Luo Binghe thought he was a creation in his own dreamscape. Seeing him leaning against the bamboo and staring blankly, Shen Qingqiu remembered his dazed appearance on the head seat during the day, all alone. Then upon comparing this version of him with the impressive commanding splendor of the original work, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but feel a little sad. Luo Binghe didn’t have a single wife by his side to treat his injuries and care for his well-being. As his teacher, how could Shen Qingqiu not feel sad for him? A dignified Stallion novel protagonist had actually fallen to this point.What man could bear to see this? Luo Binghe said: “I wonder if Shizun could have a word with me.” Shen Qingqiu’s heart was currently filled with sympathy for Luo Binghe, so he pleasantly and amiably replied: “Okay. What do you want to talk about?” He didn’t expect that after he spoke up, Luo Binghe instead froze. He instantly stood up straight and left the bamboo, a trace of disbelief showing on his face. Oops. Shen Qingqiu thought: Does he think this reaction isn’t right? But since the performance had already started, he had to play it to the end he absolutely could not abandon it halfway. Awkwardness was just a small matter, but giving the game away was a big deal. Shen Qingqiu smiled slightly and said: “Didn’t you let this teacher talk with you?” His tone of voice was the same that he had always used when living with Luo Binghe in the past. The corner of Luo Binghe’s mouth twitched, and he slowly walked on over. Shen Qingqiu did not change expression. He slowly opened and closed the folding fan in his hands, using these light and small movements to ease his tension. After remaining silent for a while, Luo Binghe spoke up: “In the past, Shizun never even bothered to look at me, just walked off on his own, don’t even mention talking with me. Perhaps my imagination today is a little too beautiful.” Shen Qingqiu’s heart stirred. Even though he felt there was something a little strange about this, these words truly did sound a bit pitiful. Could it be that Luo Binghe had always previously imagined “Shen Qingqiu” as treating him with this aloof, elegant, and noble indifference? He probably does actually have some masochistic tendencies… As Shen Qingqiu was thinking this, in his distraction his hand subconsciously moved on its own, systematically patting Luo Binghe’s head. He had performed this action countless times before: people always said you shouldn’t touch the head of a man or the waist of a woman, but on the contrary, this action being forbidden made one even more tempted. Shen Qingqiu especially loved to pat people’s heads, but regrettably, as an adult, he couldn’t act so impolitely and hadn’t had anyone willing to let him touch. Fortunately, Luo Binghe previously did not mind having Shen Qingqiu’s hand placed on his head at all. Shen Qingqiu had patted him when bored to the point where he’d actually made a habit out of it, and he did the same action now.He had barely patted twice when all of a sudden, Luo Binghe raised his arm, his left hand gripping Shen Qingqiu’s left wrist. Shen Qingqiu’s expression solidified as he thought: Isn’t this a bit too close? Immediately afterward, his right wrist was also firmly grasped. Suddenly looking up, Shen Qingqiu felt his vision blur. As if gently touched by feathers, his cheeks were swept. A strange sensation came from his lips, both soft and slightly cool. His eyes opened wide, meeting Luo Binghe’s dark pupils. His throat bobbed with difficulty. He wanted to speak but had no way to open his mouth. Because his mouth was bitten. Luo Binghe closed his eyes, his long black eyelashes casting curved shadows on his cheeks. He looked very well-behaved, but his mouth and hands were the exact opposite. He bit Shen Qingqiu’s lips with a hint of resentment and indignation, carrying a little childlike hatred. His right hand loosened the hold on Shen Qingqiu’s stiff arm, instead supporting his waist and pressing him into his arms. Their two figures clearly weren’t much different in stature, but his embracing posture took Shen Qingqiu into his arms. Shen Qingqiu’s worldview blitzed through a continuous cycle of destruction and reconstruction at the speed of light. What ultimately breached his state of complete breakdown was a system reminder accompanied by its own celebratory BGM: Coolness Points +500! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Important things must be said three times! Shen Qingqiu: “What. The. Fuck??” He finally understood why Luo Binghe had not pushed down a single girl to the point where not a single shadow of the 3000 harem beauties had been seen, yet the coolness points had never decreased. Because he had used Shen Qingqiu to make up for the coolness points!"
"柳清歌道： “ 你干了什么？ ” 他真是永远也忘不了刚才那一幕 , 乘鸾剑斩破入口后，室内空荡荡的 , 只有坐化台上帷幔之 间有人影交叠。 柳清歌知道洛冰河肯定在里面 , 只是他万万没想到，在里面的 , 不止他一个！ 洛冰河挑了挑眉 , 把左手那具软绵绵的身体往怀里带了带 , 道： “ 你说我干了什么？ ” 沈清秋都要给他跪了。 两个人 , 或说一个活人和一个死人 , 衣不遮体地从一个类似于床的地方上滚下来搂作一团  怎么看也不像干了什么好事！！！ 柳清歌一语不发，乘鸾刺出。心魔剑仍未完全出鞘，洛冰河只用剑鞘就挡住了乘鸾锋芒。 剑气凌人，他微一侧身，挡住凛冽的剑气，把手中躯体护在身后，脸现怒色。 柳清歌也发觉，在这么狭窄的室内出动乘鸾，一个不小心，锐利的剑气就有可能损及那具 尸体，立刻召剑回鞘，开始和洛冰河对拼起灵力。 翻滚厮斗间，那具身体的衣服松松垮垮，彻底滑到腰间，洛冰河的手掌心直接贴着那白皙 的皮肉。 柳清歌双眼布满血丝，道： “ 畜生，他好歹是你师父！ ” 洛冰河从容道： “ 若是旁人，你以为我会这么做？ ” 一旁围成数圈的幻花宫弟子皆是呆若木鸡，弄不明白现状。洛冰河也不去理会，一心应对 柳清歌。两人身体四周空气中灵力如同煮沸的水一般翻滚四射，脸上神情一个比一个可怖 ，根本没人敢再踏进幻花阁内，生怕殃及鱼池。 沈清秋倒是不怕殃及。他只是单纯地无法直视而已。 …… 太重口了。太尼玛重口了！ 给他月球表面般坑坑洼洼的脑洞也从没想过有一天他自己会成为这种重口 play 里的主角之 一！ 洛冰河怀里抱的那个 …… 的确是死了的对吧？！ 绝对没错吧，因为自爆的就是沈清秋自己啊！那是他的尸体好吗？！？！ 这已经不是西斯空寂的问题了，不用细思都让人不能接受啊！！！ 虽然无法直视，可他还没忘记，自己回来的原因，是为了帮柳清歌。 帮柳清歌就是帮他自己（的尸体）！ 沈清秋闪身至柳清歌身后。后者一警，本以为是偷袭者，冷笑一声，预备用灵力震开，然 而一只手贴上他背后，一股虽缓却坚定有力的灵流灌入他灵脉之中。 这感觉莫名有些熟悉。 柳清歌这边得了助力，洛冰河稍稍被压制住。他不敢大意，微微侧首，眼角只能看清身后 之人一团模糊的脸部，似乎用东西遮住了面孔。柳清歌低声道： “ 是谁？ ” 沈清秋不答话，手中加力。两道强劲无比的灵力汇成一流，洛冰河虽生生扛住了，可这股 攻击性的灵力会顺着他的身体、传到他手中所抱的躯壳上。他能化解，死人却不能化解， 如不放手，多半这身体会被灵力震得七窍爆裂。洛冰河不愿损伤尸体，只得撒了手。那身 体旋即被沸腾的灵力场弹开，飞了出去。 洛冰河脱手之后，视线也牢牢粘在那身体之上，脸上神色无奈又不甘心。沈清秋见他这幅 表情，忽然略感不忍心。用这办法逼他放手，有点像在欺负他。 有几名弟子不知轻重要去动，洛冰河喝道： “ 别碰！ ” 远远挥袖，那边惨叫一片。沈清秋撤 去加在柳清歌背后的灵力，脚底一点，飞跃上前，把那具身体接了个满怀。 自己抱着自己的尸体，这感觉 …… 真不是一般的奇怪。 沈清秋粗略看了看，他以前的肉身居然还气色红润得很，四肢柔软与活人无异，只是双目 紧闭，仿佛沉沉睡去。 自爆身亡者灵力散尽，体内不会存留修为来助尸身不腐，而且死亡时间已逾五年，单是用 冰来保存，做不到这样的程度。躯体上不闻草药味，应该也不是进行了化学药物处理。不 知道洛冰河用了什么方法，才能保存得完美如斯。 沈清秋闪过一道劈山裂石的暴击，一抬头，洛冰河正死死盯着他，满面狰狞之色。沈清秋 这才发现，这具身体上身的衣衫已尽数滑落，赤【裸裸被他抱在怀里，又摸又看，怎么瞧 都是一个极其 …… 不健康的画面。 他忙拉了拉尸身的衣服，往柳清歌那边一送： “ 接住！ ” 洛冰河要去夺，却被沈清秋缠住了。沈清秋原本担心洛冰河催动天魔血蛊，可不知道他是 急疯了还是杀昏了头，居然没想到要发动这一王牌。柳清歌一手接住那具身体，另一手轻 松击退涌上来的幻花宫弟子。这尸体被他们抛来抛去，上衣算是彻底裂了，柳清歌一入手 ，只觉得掌心贴上了一段光滑皮肤，又凉又细，触手之地仿佛有细微电流爬过，浑身一僵 ，搂哪里都像不适合，险些把人又推回去。好在他终是忍住了这冲动，一脱外袍，白衣飞 展如羽翼，把怀中身体一裹，乘鸾出鞘。 洛冰河瞳孔变成赤色，沈清秋感觉那边传来的灵力暴涨。 整个幻花阁，仿佛一个密封的盒子，盒子中放了一颗炸弹，炸弹炸开，四壁轰然倒塌。 伴随着飞沙走石一齐落出的，还有两样东西，撞在地上发出金石之响。 沈清秋定睛一看，居然是两把剑。 正阳，修雅。 这两把本该断为数截的残剑，不知用什么方法被修好了，系在一起，安置在幻花阁中，随 着阁室崩塌，这才重见天日。 再见到这两把剑，沈清秋心中不知是什么滋味，看向洛冰河。 他原本就衣衫不整，这一波轰炸过后，明晰的锁骨和胸膛都露了出来，临近心脏之处，爬 着一道形状狰狞的剑伤。 洛冰河的自我修复能力极强，即便砍掉手脚，他也能无缝对接回来，甚至可以重新长出 来。除非他自己刻意不去治愈，否则他身体上没有不能痊愈无痕的伤口。 沈清秋被他陡然暴起的灵力震得内脏几乎移位，冲柳清歌喝道： “ 走！ ” 感觉他自从到了这边，经常做断后的那一个啊？！都要被自己的舍己为人感动了！柳清歌 看他一眼，果然毫不拖泥带水，说走就走，挟着那身体飞身上剑，电光般风驰电掣而出。 洛冰河眼睁睁看着柳清歌挟着沈清秋尸身离去，脸上出现了刹那的空白。 他呆呆站在原地，连还击都忘了，像是个孩子被人夺去了视作全世界、最心爱的事物，一 副天都要塌下来了的模样。 沈清秋见状，刚才一闪而过的那种不忍心感越发强烈。 可不忍心也没办法。继续任由他抱着尸体，不知道还会有什么可怕的发展啊啊啊！ 他正打算浑水摸鱼溜走，洛冰河却哪会给他这机会，所有的怒火都朝他身上发泄了，心魔 剑出鞘一半，正打算把这人千刀万剐，忽然从幻花宫弟子中掠出一道黑影。 那身影迅捷无伦，拖起沈清秋就走。洛冰河自问眼力绝佳，居然也没留意到这两人是如何 逃脱的。他站在原地，暴风雨在眼底胸中聚集。 幻花宫众弟子一直插不上手，但也知道洛冰河今晚必然会雷霆大发，忙大片大片跪倒。 偏偏纱华铃这时候才赶到，匆匆上前，一来就被洛冰河震飞出去。她早知道这位喜怒无常 ，也不知是怎么又惹怒了他，惶恐道： “ 君上息怒。君上息怒！ ” 洛冰河道： “ 你带回来的人，真不错。 ” 这个 “ 不错 ” 简直比听到洛冰河让她当场自裁还可怕。纱华铃魂飞天外，忙道： “ 属下有事 禀告！侵入者一进来，属下就觉察了，并且与之周旋。侵入者不止柳清歌一人！这百战峰 峰主以往也夜探过宫内，可破不了迷阵。这次是有人首先破掉了迷阵，柳清歌才得以入侵 成功。 ” 洛冰河望着柳清歌御剑消失的方向，缓缓收紧拳头，指骨喀喀作响。 纱华铃心想，洛冰河肯定不关心另外一个侵入者是谁，他在意的恐怕只有沈清秋被夺走的 尸体，忙改口道： “ 柳清歌一个人带着那 …… 带着 …… 走不远的！属下这就带人去追！ ” 洛冰河道： “ 不用了。 ” 纱华铃一抖，心凉凉的，涌上一阵不详的预感。 只听洛冰河冷声道： “ 我亲自去。你把漠北叫上来。 ” 沈清秋这次总算知道，以往洛冰河操纵他体内血蛊的时候，到底有多温柔了。 如果洛冰河真的想要用天魔血让一个人死，那么根本不可能只是大姨妈痛的程度。他能让 你生不如死，痛得站也站不稳、话都说不出，只能在地上打滚，滚完了死尸一样躺在地上 ，可浑身上下的痛楚不少一分，根本等不到缓解或者习惯的时候。 在乱斗的震怒过后，洛冰河终于想到还有天魔血这样东西了。 刚才趁乱把他拖了出来的那人大概是已经把他带到了安全地带，放慢速度，扶着他走起 来。沈清秋想坐不想走，可已经没力气说话了，半死不活被拖着行了一段，那人终于发现 不对劲了。 他把沈清秋放到地上，听声音温柔又清爽，语速略慢，似乎是个年轻男子，语气关切道： “ 你怎么样？刚才受伤了吗？ ” 沈清秋动了动嘴唇，还是没力气说一个字。现在他血管里有数亿条蛊虫正在狂欢，撕咬膨 胀，蠕动扭曲，那感觉又恶心、又痛苦。 洛冰河现在是真想杀了他。 沈清秋忽然想到，要是洛冰河知道他是谁的话，会是什么情形。归根结底，他倒霉，洛冰 河貌似也挺倒霉的。说不清楚谁比谁更倒霉。 他把这些年种种事迹从头到尾飞快地过了一遍，真心觉得挺滑稽的。简直荒诞。刚干笑了 两声，随即又是一阵大痛，真的在地上滚了两滚。好像这样就能缓解一下。 没滚两圈就被那人按住了，他摸了摸沈清秋额头，还有脸颊，稀稀拉拉的胡子都掉得差不 多了，俱是冷汗，再往下摸，摸到了沈清秋的心口和小腹。 不知为何，他碰过的地方就会稍微好受一点，沈清秋缓过一口气，忍不住说： “ 兄弟，你 …… 摸哪里呢？ ” 要在以往，他真的不会在意别人摸他哪里，爱摸哪摸哪，请自便。但是自从不久之前被洛 冰河开启了一连串新世界的大门，沈清秋二十多年来已成型的三观受到了严重冲击，他今 后必须要用全新的目光来看待这个世界的一切问题。 第一点就是同性【交友问题！ 那人 “ 啊 ” 了一声，连忙放了手，道歉： “ 对不起。我 …… 不是有意的。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 别别别！你摸吧！请继续！谢谢你！ ” 不是错觉，这人一放手，沈清秋立刻就痛起来了。他好像 …… 真的能安抚天魔血！ 沈清秋扭头，月光之下，不能将对方容貌看清楚，但大致是个明朗俊秀的轮廓，一双眼睛 十分之清澈，露水般交叠倒映着沈清秋的影子和月光清辉。 沈清秋看着那双眼睛，脑子里像有什么要炸开了，身体也痛得发麻，哀叹一声，微微蜷起 ，五指成拳，在地上猛地一砸。 不成了，尼玛这死法太坑爹了！ 突然，沈清秋的后领被人提起，下颔一痛，被捏开了口，灌进一股液体。 他舌头发麻胃里反酸，尝不出这液体什么味道，但应该不是什么好喝的东西，呛了一口， 要吐，那人捂住他嘴巴，动作强横，语气却十分轻柔，哄道： “ 咽下去。 ” 沈清秋喉结剧烈耸动，仓促之间，还是把那液体咽了下去。嘴角漏了几丝不明液体，他埋 头一阵猛咳，那男子就在一旁帮他拍背顺气。 令人震惊的是，这液体入口入腹后，折磨他一路的血虫噬咬之痛迅速收敛。 他可从没听说过天魔血这种东西是有解药的！ 沈清秋身体舒服了，心却吊起来了。他一把拽住那人胸口衣服： “ 你给我喝的是什么？ ” 他把沈清秋的手指一根根掰开，从胸口拿了下来，微笑道： “ 现在还痛么？ ” 不痛了。真的不痛了。 可是就因为不痛了，所以才可怕。 随着舌头的味觉渐渐回复，沈清秋感觉口腔里的血腥之气也愈发浓烈。浓烈到几欲作呕的 地步。 原著说的很清楚了，一切药物对天魔之血都是没有作用的。 只有天魔血才能与天魔血相互制衡。 草。 不但喝过两次，而且喝过两道原主不同的天魔血。 沈清秋觉得，自己真他妈当得起前无古人，后无来者这八个字。","CHAPTER 50: COMPLETELY SHATTERED WORLD VIEWS Upon abruptly realizing the truth, Shen Qingqiu was half horrified and agitated, half aggrieved and indignant. He immediately raised his foot for a kick! Luo Binghe did not evade or dodge. He received the kick straight-on, yet he did not retreat a single step. He even refused to let go and kept holding Shen Qingqiu, looking both angry and wronged as he asked: “I can’t do it even in a dream?” Hurry and wake up! Even though you’re dreaming, I’m not something you made while dreaming, okay? I can’t slap him awake, but I can’t let him continue this muddled sleepwalking either! This is what’s truly called being stuck between the hammer and the anvil! Shen Qingqiu had yet to think of anything to roar to calm down his mood when, caught off guard, his back slammed into the green bamboo and was pushed onto it. Luo Binghe bowed his head and pressed down again. It wasn’t Shen Qingqiu’s first time being kissed, but this was his first time feeling the very real threat that the other party could go crazy and bite off his lips at any moment. In the interval of their chaotic breathing, Luo Binghe whispered: “Shizun, I was wrong…” Shen Qingqiu finally managed to pull out a hand and press it against Luo Binghe’s chest. He really didn’t want to make the same posture as “a woman from a good family resisting a ruffian,” but did Luo Binghe’s appearance fucking seem like someone who understood he was in the wrong? Shen Qingqiu was the one who was wrong, truly wrong, completely and utterly wrong. What “wind from an empty cave 171 ”? Jianghu gossip was all based on scientific evidence. Every single gossiper must have been an angel who could see the essence of reality through appearances in their past life! He didn’t raise the male protagonist into an asexual, and it wasn’t a problem of him being masochistic either. The truth was far more terrible than those options: he had raised the male protagonist into being gay! No wonder he hadn’t received a single wife and his harem was in such an awful state. Women were already incapable of attracting his interest and couldn’t be linked to his coolness level! What the fuck!Shen Qingqiu refused to submit, sparing no effort to struggle and stubbornly resist. Just as he was considering which fate would be more miserable between self-detonating himself again vs. kicking Luo Binghe’s key area… Luo Binghe suddenly let him go. He looked up at the swirling vortex of clouds in the sky above them and his face unexpectedly turned gloomy. In an instant, the scenes and figures before Shen Qingqiu’s eyes collapsed and disappeared, shattering into thousands of pieces. At the same time, Shen Qingqiu leaped onto the roof of the Huan Hua Palace’s main hall. This was the true real world! Shen Qingqiu took vigorous breaths for a while. After finally settling his mind with much difficulty, he was surprised to see flames lighting up the entire main hall area. The ringing of various alarm bells blended together. He poked his head out, his clothes continuously furling in the night wind. From top to bottom, countless lanterns converged toward this sideHuan Hua Palace’s various departments of disciples were currently flooding here from all directions. “To your stations! All departments listen to orders, to your stations!” Someone cursed: “Broke in again? How many invasions has this been? Has there been one successful prevention?” Shen Qingqiu was overjoyed. An invasion was the best situation for him to take advantage of the chaos to escape. Who cares about that “Heavenly Demon Blood” stuff? How could it compare to the importance of integrity? I’m leaving first, we can talk later, goodbye! He had not yet flown two steps when he heard someone shouting: “He went towards Huan Hua Pavilionlay formations to stop Liu Qingge!” Shen Qingqiu’s feet slipped, and he immediately turned around to come back. Dammit. Liu Qingge just had to come at this time. There was no way Shen Qingqiu could throw him to the completely broken down Luo Binghe who was in the middle of throwing a fit, right? The Huan Hua Pavilion was the place where previous dynasties of palace masters cultivated and resided, and wasn’t far from his current location. Shen Qingqiu jumped off the roof in a couple steps and mixed into the large army rushing over. Before they even entered the Huan Hua Pavilion, forceful waves of chilly air greeted them face-on. From within came a shout of rage full of killing intent. “Get lost!”When the crowd heard the alarm bells, some unaware disciples had broken in the door. Dozens of people in the front row of the crowd were all sent flying out by a wave of extremely powerful energy. Shen Qingqiu, who was in the next group of people, managed to perfectly dodge this attack and pick a good position. Fishing in troubled waters 172 , he fished his way inside. Just as he entered the door, goosebumps rose on his skin from the freezing chill. The entire Huan Hua Pavilion seemed to have become an enormous ice cave. Just taking one step inside was like stepping into a frozen world of ice and snow. Cold air flowed into Shen Qingqiu’s sleeves and robes, and the cold sweat on his forehead and the back of his hand rapidly froze into a layer of thin ice. You can imagine the sheer extent of the cold in the room. Not only was the temperature extremely low, but the walls on all sides were also tightly sealed and the doors and windows were all airtight. The entire chamber was both cold and dark. If it weren’t for the intruder (i.e. Liu Qingge, director of the Cang Qiong Mountain Demolition Office) forcibly smashing open a large gap, the entire place would resemble a coffin of ice. On the seating table 173 at the center of the pavilion, a curtain was half drawn back. A few black and white outer robes were messily piled up on the side of the table. Luo Binghe himself was only wearing his inner clothes, looking like he had just gotten up from his bed. His black hair was scattered and loose, his clothes disorganized, his neckline crooked and open. His face was pale white but his lips carried a touch of bloody red. Cold light flashed in his eyes, the ghastly energy exerting immense pressure. The cutting edge of his sword was exposed and his posture was one of preparation for battle. Seven steps away, precisely facing him, the bones of Liu Qingge’s sword hand protruded explosively from his grip. His whole face was green and blue. Liu Qingge stared at the calm and composed Luo Binghe sitting on the table. He enunciated every syllable: “You bastard.” On the Cheng Luan sword, spiritual energy and killing intent rose with scathing violence. Shen Qingqiu vigilantly glanced back and forth between the two sides. However, just taking one look in the direction that Liu Qingge’s sword was pointing, in his mind he could hear the noise of the very last shred of his desperately resisting world views completely shattering. Luo Binghe’s right hand was placed on the Xin Mo sword that never left his side, and the snow-white blade had already left its sheath by half; on the other side, his left hand held a person.Instead of saying it was a person, it would be better to say it was “a body”: completely lifeless, head hanging down, limbs weak, but very soft. It was wearing a thin layer of inner clothes. The collar had slipped below the shoulders, revealing half of a back as white as paper. Liu Qingge said: “What have you done?” He truly would never be able to forget the scene just now. When the Cheng Luan sword had cut open a gap, the room was empty aside from the overlapping shadows among the curtains on the seating table. Liu Qingge knew that Luo Binghe must be inside, but he could never have imagined that it was not just him inside! Luo Binghe raised his eyebrows and tugged the soft body in his left hand up further into his arms: “What do you say I have done?” Shen Qingqiu was completely speechless. Two peopleto be specific a living person and a dead personwho were not wearing covering clothes as they rolled down from a place similar to a bed and hugged into a ballno matter how one looked at it, it didn’t seem like anything positive! Liu Qingge did not speak a word, and Cheng Luan stabbed out. Xin Mo sword was still not completely out of its sheath. Only using the scabbard, Luo Binghe blocked Cheng Luan’s sharp edge. As the fierce sword energy approached, he leaned slightly sideways. He blocked the biting cold sword energy while protecting the body in his hand behind himself, anger showing on his face. Liu Qingge also discovered that activating Cheng Luan in such a narrow room also carried the risk of sharp sword energy damaging that corpse. He immediately called his sword back into its sheath and began to fight Luo Binghe using spiritual energy. During their rough and tumble duel, that body’s clothes loosened and slid down to the waist, and Luo Binghe’s palm directly attached to the fair flesh. Liu Qingge’s eyes turned completely bloodshot: “Brute, no matter what, he is your Shizun!” Luo Binghe calmly said: “If it were someone else, do you think I would do this?” The encircling Huan Hua Palace disciples were utterly dumbstruck and slack-jawed. Luo Binghe did not pay any attention to them either, entirely focused on dealing with Liu Qingge. In the air around both men’s bodies, spiritual energy roiled like boiling water, shooting in all directions. The expressions on their faces grew more horrible with each passing moment. Noone dared to step inside the Huan Hua Pavilion for fear of adding to the chaos 174 . Shen Qingqiu wasn’t afraid of adding to the chaos. He was simply unable to look directly at this sight. Too hardcore. Way too fucking hardcore! His brain was as full of holes 175 as the surface of the moon, but he had never once imagined there would come a day where he became one of the main characters in this hardcore PLAY. The one held in Luo Binghe’s arms… was indeed dead, right? Absolutely correct, because that was his corpse, alright? This was no longer something “horrible once one carefully thought it over.” Even without carefully thinking it over, this was a clearly horrible predicament! Although he couldn’t look directly, he still hadn’t forgotten why he came back. Shen Qingqiu flashed behind Liu Qingge’s back. The latter raised his guard, thinking it was a sneak attacker. He sneered and prepared to use his spiritual power to shock this other party away. However, a hand was placed on his back and a gentle but firm stream of power began flowing into his spiritual circulation. With Liu Qingge receiving this aid, Luo Binghe was now the one being slightly suppressed. Liu Qingge still did not dare to act carelessly and slightly tilted his head. Looking behind himself out of the corner of his eyes, he could only see a blurred face that seemed to be using something to cover its appearance. Liu Qingge whispered: “Who’s there?” Shen Qingqiu did not answer, while his hand used more force. The two peerlessly strong streams of spiritual power merged into one. Although Luo Binghe managed to bear it straight-on, this wave of aggressive spiritual power would inevitably follow his body and transmit into the corpse in his hands. He was capable of dispelling this energy, but the dead person in his arms could not. If he didn’t let go, the body would most likely be badly shocked to the point of explosively bursting. Luo Binghe was not willing to damage the corpse, so he could only loosen his hand. The body was immediately bounced away by the boiling spiritual energy and flew out. Even after Luo Binghe was forced to let go, his line of sight remained firmly stuck on that body, and his face showed unwillingness and helplessness. Seeing his expression, Shen Qingqiu abruptly could not bear it. Using this method to force him to let go felt a little bit like they were bullying him. A few disciples with no appreciation for the gravity of this situationwanted to act, but Luo Binghe yelled: “Don’t touch!” As he waved his sleeves in the distance, screams rose from that side. Shen Qingqiu removed the stream of spiritual power applied to Liu Qingge’s back. With a flick of his soles, he leaped forward and carefully caught that body in his arms. The sensation of holding your own corpse truly was a one-of-a-kind strange experience. Shen Qingqiu roughly glanced himself over. His former body still had a very rosy complexion and soft limbs, no different from a living person in a deep sleep except for the tightly closed eyes and lack of breath. Upon death from self-detonation, one’s spiritual power would dissipate. There would not be any remaining cultivation preventing the corpse from rotting. Five years after death, just freezing it in ice would not be able to preserve the body to this extent. There was no herbal scent on the body, so it should not have been treated with any chemical preservatives. It was unclear what method Luo Binghe had used. Shen Qingqiu dodged a spiritual burst powerful enough to split mountains and crack stone. He looked up to see Luo Binghe’s gaze completely fixed on him, his expression savage and ferocious. Only then did Shen Qingqiu discover that the corpse’s clothes had slipped down from its upper body, bones and flesh exposed as he held it in his arms. Added to how he was touching and looking at it… It was overall an extremely unhealthy and rather provocative sight. He hurriedly pulled up the corpse’s clothes and sent this hot potato towards Liu Qingge: “Catch!” Luo Binghe wanted to seize it, but he was caught up in Shen Qingqiu’s entanglement. Shen Qingqiu was originally worried that Luo Binghe would activate the Heavenly Demon blood parasite, but whether because he had been overwhelmed by killing intent or been struck silly by his anxiety, Luo Binghe actually did not think to use this trump card. Liu Qingge caught the body with one hand and called Cheng Luan with the other, easily beating back the siege of the Huan Hua Palace disciples. After being tossed back and forth by them, the corpse’s clothes had completely split off its upper body. Liu Qingge had just touched it when he felt his palm sticking to smooth skin, both fine and cool. The area he touched seemed to have a slight electrical current crawling over it, and his entire body froze. No matter where he held it, everywhere seemed unsuitable, and he almost pushed it away from himself. In the end, he managed to resist this impulse. He took off his outer robe, the white clothes spreading wide like wings, and wrapped the body in his arms up. Cheng Luan flew back to him and steadily floated before his feet.Luo Binghe’s pupils had completely turned bright red. The entire Huan Hua Pavilion was akin to a sealed box with a bomb placed inside. When the bomb exploded, all the walls collapsed with a roaring crash. Along with the flying sand and hurtling stones, aside from all the numerous people, there were two items that made a resounding metallic clang when they hit the ground. Shen Qingqiu focused his vision and saw these were actually two swords. Zheng Yang, Xiu Ya. These two broken swords had once shared a common destiny and been shattered in countless pieces. It was unclear how they had been repaired, tied together, and placed in the Huan Hua Pavilion. Only with the pavilion’s collapse did they once again see the sky and sun. Seeing these two swords once again, Shen Qingqiu felt an unclear taste rising in his heart and looked at Luo Binghe. His clothes had originally been untidy in the first place, and now after this wave of bombardments, his well- defined clavicle and chest were all exposed. On his chest wall, a hideous sword scar approached his heart. Luo Binghe’s self-regeneration ability was extremely strong. Even if his limbs were cut off, he could seamlessly re-attach them, and even re-grow them without a problem. Unless he deliberately chose not to heal them, there were no wounds he couldn’t completely recover without even leaving a scar. Luo Binghe fiercely shouted: “Liu Qingge, for Shizun’s sake I have spared your life time and time again. If you insist on seeking death, then don’t blame me!” His sudden outburst of spiritual power and murderousness quaked Shen Qingqiu to the point where he almost changed positions. He knew Luo Binghe’s temper had flared up, so he hurriedly yelled at Liu Qingge: “Still not leaving?” It felt like ever since he came to this side, he was frequently making these selfless sacrifices to cover others’ retreat! Liu Qingge glanced at him and indeed did not do a sloppy jobhe left straight away, carrying that body under his arms as he leaped onto his sword to exit as quick as lightning. Luo Binghe originally wanted to attack, but he unexpectedly felt his heart quakethe backlash of the Xin Mo sword came out of the blue and slowed him down by a hair. Just from this missing hair, he could only look on helplessly as Liu Qingge left with Shen Qingqiu’s corpse under his arm. In a daze, Luo Binghe stood in place as if the sky had fallen, even forgetting to counterattack. For an instant, blankness appeared on his face, like achild who had his most beloved thing in the world taken away from him. Shen Qingqiu had been planning to take advantage of his daze to fish in troubled waters and slip away. But when he saw this situation, for some unknown reason, his heel stuck to the ground and that flash of unbearableness grew more and more intense. But even if he couldn’t bear it, there was nothing he could do. If he continued to let Luo Binghe hold that corpse, it was unclear what horrifying sinful developments would happen! The problem came with this untimely softening of his heart. He had not successfully snuck away when Luo Binghe suddenly turned his head, those two violent red eyes fixated directly on him. The Xin Mo sword trembled in its sheath with joy and maliciousness. Luo Binghe’s eyes very clearly told Shen Qingqiu that he would definitely become mincemeat in just a little bit. Seeing his furious and grieving gaze, Shen Qingqiu took two steps back. All of a sudden, as if his reason had been bewitched, he wanted to tell Luo Binghe the truth. He wanted to tell him: “Don’t be this sad, Shizun is not dead.” Just as he moved his lips, a black shadow flashed out from the crowd of Huan Hua Palace disciples. The figure moved with remarkable swiftness, wrapping up Shen Qingqiu and leaving like a whirlwind. Even with Luo Binghe’s superb eyesight and reaction speed, the explosive shot he made actually failed to hit. He stood in the same place, staring coldly at the remaining ruins of the Huan Hua Pavilion, dilapidated and crawling with forces. The crowd of Huan Hua Palace disciples had been continuously unable to get involved, but they understood Luo Binghe was ill at ease tonight after these unexpected defeats and would inevitably erupt in a thunderstorm. The masses of disciples hurried to kneel down. At this time, Sha Hualing finally managed to make it over and quickly rushed to the front. The moment she arrived, she was sent flying backward by Luo Binghe and vomited three liters of blood. She had long since known him to be capricious and temperamental, and she did not know what had angered him again. She could only say in a terrified tone of voice: “Lord, quell your anger. Lord, quell your anger!” Luo Binghe spoke: “The person you brought back was truly not bad.” This “not bad” was even more terrifying than if she heard Luo Binghe order her execution on the spot. Sha Hualing’s soul almost left her body as she hurried to say: “This subordinate has a matter to report! When the intrusionoccurred, this subordinate had detected the invasion and acted to deal with it. But Liu Qingge was not the only intruder! This Bai Zhan Peak Lord had previously scouted inside the palace at night, but he was unable to break the maze formation. This time someone else first destroyed the maze formation, and that is why Liu Qingge was able to successfully break through.” Luo Binghe stared in the direction that Liu Qingge had disappeared on his sword. He slowly clenched his fists, his knuckles cracking."
"血肉撕裂的声音。 还有喑哑的惨呼。 沈清秋按紧太阳穴 , 眼前景象逐渐清晰起来。 一片血海。 尸堆成山。 洛冰河站在这彷如炼狱般的场景中 , 木然而立。 他身穿玄衣 , 染不上红色，可半边脸颊都贱上了殷红的血色，机械又冷酷地手起剑落。 沈清秋愣愣看着这幕画面。 原本他一看到洛冰河，脑中就自动浮现他抱着自己身体从床上滚下来滚作一团的模样 , 毛 骨悚然 , 只想立刻躲得远远的。可现在，连回避的心思都被震惊到淡了。 洛冰河居然在残杀自己的梦境造物。这跟自己拿一把钢刀往他脑浆里搅基本没什么区别。 如果不是弱智不懂事 , 只有疯子才干这种事！ 虽然沈清秋老爱说洛冰河是个抖 m 喜欢自虐，可自虐到了这个程度 , 他无论如何也干笑不 出来了。 洛冰河抬眼看他，目光中混混沌沌，俨然一副神智不清的模样。可双眼一下子清亮起来， 立刻抛开手中长剑，扔得远远的。 他把沾满鲜血的双手藏在身后，小声喊道： “ 师尊。 ” 然后，忽然想起脸上也有血，补救一般用袖子擦了擦半边脸上的血迹，结果越擦越脏，好 像个偷东西被当场发现的孩童，越发不安。 沈清秋勉强镇定下来，道： “…… 你在做什么？ ” 洛冰河低声道： “ 师尊，我 …… 我又把你弄丢了。弟子没用，连你的身体都保不住。 ” 沈清秋神色复杂。 所以他刚才虐杀梦境造物，算是 …… 自我惩戒？ 难怪洛冰河连他是幻境产物还是外界入侵者都感知不了。 沈清秋是真没想到，洛冰河已经到了这个地步。他现在这个样子，跟疯了没什么区别。 瞧着洛冰河这娴熟程度，恐怕已经不是第一回这么干了。沈清秋何止是不忍心，简直想说 是罪过。 沈清秋叹了口气，不由自主放缓了声音，安慰道： “ 丢了就丢了吧。 ” 洛冰河怔怔看着他，道： “…… 可我现在只有那个了。 ” 他真的五年都是都抱着一具尸体、一个空壳子过来的吗？！ 洛冰河声音忽然冷了下来： “ 花月城之后，我说过这辈子永远再不会把师尊弄丢，可还是 让旁人抢走了。 ” 刻骨的恨意和瞳孔里的暗红色一样表露无遗。被他抛开的长剑受召飞起，将地上垂死挣扎 的几 “ 人 ” 穿膛而过。阵阵惨呼声中，沈清秋下意识按住他，斥责道： “ 你别乱来！在梦境 里这是在自残你知道吗？！ ” 洛冰河当然不会不知道，这个结界都是他一手创造的。 他直勾勾盯着沈清秋，反手按在他手背上，半晌才道： “ 我知道我是在做梦。也只有在梦 里，师尊你还会这么骂我。 ” 听了这句，沈清秋忽然醒悟过来。 不行。不对。 不能这样对洛冰河。 要是你对一个人没那种意思，就不应该给他希望。希望越大，失望越大，继续神志不清、 乃至丧心病狂的几率也更大。就算是在梦里，也不应该这样拖拖拉拉婆婆妈妈。 当断则断，再牵扯不清下去就成冤孽了。沈清秋果断抽回手，正了正脸色，摆出拒人于千 里之外的面孔，转身就走。 洛冰河一被甩开，呆了一下，立刻追上来，道： “ 师尊，我知错了。 ” 沈清秋冷冷地说： “ 知道错了就别跟过来！ ” 洛冰河急道： “ 我早就后悔了，只是一直没法对你说。你还生气我逼得你自爆灵体吗？我 已经把师尊身体里的灵脉全都修复好了，绝无欺瞒！只要我能进入圣陵 …… 一定有办法让 你再醒过来。 ” 沈清秋不答话，心想是不是该冲他脑门甩几记暴击才能把他打醒，可洛冰河猛地扑了上来 ，从后面把他圈住，牢牢抱着，撒泼打滚也不肯撒手。 沈清秋被他抱得浑身僵硬，好像被个毛茸茸的东西蹭了，简直寒毛倒竖，手中运劲，却还 是没真打上去，咬牙挤出一个字： “ 滚！ ” 说好了黑化之后不走苦情路线的啊！不要拉拉扯扯的！ 洛冰河充耳不闻，道： “ 还是师尊气的是金兰城之事？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 不错。 ” 洛冰河偏不肯放手，喃喃道： “ 刚从无间深渊返出时，知道师尊你对外宣称我是被魔族所 杀，先前还以为是师尊心软，毕竟留着几分情念，不愿让我身败名裂。谁知一见面后，看 师尊态度，我又怕原先是我想的太美了，我怕师尊为我隐瞒，只是觉得教出了一个魔头， 败坏了清誉。 ” 他说得可怜兮兮的，一句接一句抢着往外倒，好像生怕沈清秋粗暴地打断他不让继续说， 道： “ 撒种人真不是我安排的。我那时是气糊涂了才任由师尊被关进水牢 …… 我早就知道 错了。 ” 若是现实中的洛冰河，恐怕不会有这么滔滔不绝的时候。大概也只有在他给自己造的梦里 ，他敢这么絮絮叨叨。在这种时候一把推开他，就像对一个好不容易抱住浮木、伤心哭诉 的小姑娘劈头盖脸扇了一耳光，未免有些残忍。 沈清秋又是于心不忍，又是倍感荒唐。 有什么比你费尽心机逃一个人逃了这么多年，最后发现人家根本不是想杀你，而是想搞你 更荒唐的？虽然无论是杀是操，结果都一样，沈清秋都会拼了老命地跑。 一个是想见不能见，抱了五年尸体。另一个是避之不及，却还总觉得见得多了。 他僵着手，举起又落下，捏紧又松开。最后，还是叹了口气，摸了摸那颗比自己要高的脑 袋。 沈清秋心想： “ 妈的，真是输了！ ” 好好一个暗黑系的种马男主，现在别说后宫，没准人家还是个处男呢。自己都把自己搞成 这副样子了，他再补刀，好像太不厚道。沈清秋还是输给了卖的一手好惨的洛冰河，还有 自己的同情心。 洛冰河立刻捉紧了他那只手。 相接之处，感觉洛冰河手心略有不平，沈清秋细看发现，原来是一道剑伤。 沈清秋原本不明白，他身上这么多伤口是怎么回事，可这时忽然想了起来。金兰城夜会， 洛冰河同他玩儿猫捉老鼠玩儿了一路，最后抓住他时，自己刺了他一剑。当时，洛冰河是 直接用手抓住了修雅剑的剑锋。 至于他胸口邻近心脏处的伤口，则更不应该忘记，那是仙盟大会上沈清秋逼他下去时刺 的。 好像自己每一次去刺洛冰河，他从来没有躲过，一直都是不闪不避，正面迎接，让他刺， 让他砍。正因为如此，两次沈清秋都没想真的刺中他，却都刺中了。砍完了以后，伤口也 不去治，反而刻意留存下来。 要是在以前，沈清秋还能理所当然地认为那是洛冰河记仇，要留下伤口时刻温习对他的仇 恨，可现在，这种行为到底是什么意思，沈清秋再也不能自欺欺人了。 那么长一本书看完了，孩子也拉扯大了，他可从没发现，洛冰河原来是个纯情少男。深情 种马这玩意儿一变基佬，后面两个字居然立刻去掉，现在这个被他养得歪到不知哪里去了 的洛冰河，心思比小姑娘还细腻，想得太多，抖 m 又容易受伤。 也可能，不是他从没发现，而是他从没想过要去发现。归根结底，沈清秋还是把洛冰河当 做一本书中的角色，脸谱化，模式化，采取时时远观、偶尔亵玩的态度。大多数时候，都 是敬而远之。原著中存在感最强的洛冰河，在他眼里反而 npc 光环最重。 对着这样的洛冰河，沈清秋纵然觉得麻烦得要命，却真有点手足无措了。一条单身狗纵横 多年，好不容易有个人好像对自己有那么点意思，结果居然 1 是男的 2 是他徒弟 3 是男主 4 表 达方式还有点变态。 究竟是该把他扇醒，还是随便他这么发疯疯下去？沈清秋头大是头大，但再也不敢随便下 手了。 沈清秋这么久以来，第一次体会到， “ 迷茫 ” 这种情绪有多让人蛋疼。 醒来之后，沈清秋睁开眼睛，上方是一片雪白的纱帐。 有人推门而入，轻声慢步关上门，道： “ 醒了？ ” 沈清秋转了转脖子，斜着眼珠去看。 灯下看人，好过月下看人，那男子果然生得一副好相貌，嘴角噙笑，明俊不可方物，尤其 是一双眼睛，显出一种温柔的灵动之气。 绝对是露水湖养出来的眼睛。 沈清秋一轱辘坐起，冰袋从额头上掉落，那男子弯腰捡起，放回桌上，给他换了新的。 见状，沈清秋原本含在口里劈头盖脸一大堆 “ 你是谁 ”“ 你意欲何为 ” 都不好意思说出来了， 干咳一声，矜持道： “ 多谢阁下幻花宫中出手相助。 ” 那年轻男子在桌边站住，笑道： “ 人有一句话，滴水之恩当涌泉相报。况且沈仙师于我之 恩，远远不止滴水。 ” 第一，他果真是白露林那蛇男。 第二，他知道这壳子底下的人是沈清秋。 沈清秋试探着问道： “…… 天琅君？ ” 上古天魔一脉之所以带了一个 “ 天 ” ，是因为传言，这一支血脉，是自仙界堕落入魔。 血统要比洛冰河纯，才能压制住沈清秋体内的天魔血。 那么，问题就来了。天魔血系中，原著给出过名字的、沈清秋知道的，就两个：洛冰河， 还有他爹。他只能猜谁呢。 只是，事不过三。沈清秋到现在为止都没有出错的奇葩猜法，终于在这里碰壁了。 那男子摇了摇头，道： “ 沈仙师将我认作君上，实在太过抬举。 ” 听到 “ 君上 ” 二字，沈清秋终于知道这位是什么角色了。 原著一开场，天琅君就已经被镇压在高山之下。对于数年前那一场大战，因为和男主的挂 逼与种马之路关系不大，向天打飞机略略带过，只说 “ 不敌人界诸多修真界泰斗合力围攻 ，被镇压于 xx 山之下，永世不得翻身，心腹大将死伤离散 ” 。 究竟 xx 山是什么山？沈清秋从没好好思索过这个问题。可受刺激之后，他终于突然想起来 xx 是啥了。 艹，白露山！！！ 白露山上白露林！！！ 沈清秋上下打量那男子。 这可是洛冰河他爹的 “ 心腹大将 ” 啊！ 现在看，他身上已经完全找不到当初那蛇男的畸形影子了。 沈清秋咽了咽喉咙，道： “ 敢问阁下 …… 尊姓大名？ ” 那男子客气道： “ 天琅君座下，竹枝郎。 ” 他话音刚落，系统传来提示音：【补全剧情完整度以及人物谱， b 格 +300 。填坑项目启动 ，b 格 +100 ！】 沈清秋陡然涌上一阵无可抑制的兴奋。 “ 填坑 ” ，指的绝对是原作中那几桩一直没有交代清楚幕后凶手的坑爹无头惨案。 这个，就沈垣最唾弃的原因（之一）。也是看完文后最让他捶胸顿足咬牙切齿的一大恨 事！ 现在，他开始引出没正面出场过的人物了，而且系统也开启了填坑项目。难道，接下来， 就要揭开那些通天巨坑的真相之谜了吗？！","CHAPTER 51: THIS DREAM IS PITIFUL Sha Hualing thought that Luo Binghe definitely didn’t care who the other invader was. He most likely only cared about Shen Qingqiu’s corpse, which had been stolen away, so she hastily changed her tone and said, “Liu Qingge can’t get very far carrying that… that… by himself! This subordinate will take people and chase after him at once!” Luo Binghe said, “No need.” Sha Hualing trembled, her heart ice cold as a vague premonition welled up in it. Only to hear Luo Binghe say coldly, “I’ll go myself. You call over Mo Bei.” This time, Shen Qingqiu finally knew just how gentle Luo Binghe had been in the past while controlling the blood parasites in his body. If Luo Binghe truly wanted to kill someone using his ancient demon blood, then there was no way that it would just be pain to the degree of period cramps. He could make you wish that you were dead rather than alive, where you would be in so much pain that you couldn’t even stand straight or speak. You could only roll around on the floor, and after you finished rolling around, you could only lie there like a corpse, but the agony in your body wouldn’t lessen a single bit. There was no way you could wait for the pain to dull or get used to it. After the fury from the fighting passed, Luo Binghe finally remembered that he still had something like the ancient demon blood. The person who had taken advantage of the chaos and dragged him out just then had most likely already brought him to a safe place. He slowed down and supported him as they walked. Shen Qingqiu wanted to sit, not walk, but he no longer had the strength to speak. He was dragged along for a while, more dead than alive, before that person finally discovered that something wasn’t quite right. He placed Shen Qingqiu on the ground. His voice was both gentle and refreshing, and he talked a little slowly. He seemed to be a young man, and he asked in deep concern, “How are you? Did you get hurt just now?” Shen Qingqiu moved his lips a little, but he still didn’t have the strength to say a single word. Right now, it felt as if there were millions and millions of parasite worms having a carnival inside his blood vessels, biting and expanding, wriggling and twisting. It felt both disgusting and agonizing.This made it seem like when Luo Binghe was controlling the blood parasites in his body in the past, he didn’t have any malice whatsoever. Instead, he was basically being extremely tender, as if he was just teasing him a bit. Shen Qingqiu rapidly flipped through all the various achievements and honourable accomplishments that he had gained under the coercion of the system during these past few years, and he truly felt that this was absurd and comical. Just what part of the story went wrong, causing Luo Binghe to be like this towards him? Shen Qingqiu knew that he himself was an unmistakably straight man ever since he was born. There should be no need to doubt Luo Binghe’s sexual orientation either. Then whose fault was it exactly? There was no need to think about it anymore. If the characters crumbled, then it was definitely the author’s problem. It was all Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky’s fault! Shen Qingqiu had just laughed dryly before he was instantly wracked by more intense pain, and Shen Qingqiu really did roll a few times on the ground. It seemed like it could relieve the pain a little this way. He didn’t manage to roll around for very long before he was restrained by that person, who touched Shen Qingqiu’s forehead and cheeks. His sparse beard had already pretty much fallen off completely by now, and he was covered in cold sweat. The person continued to stroke downwards until he touched Shen Qingqiu’s chest and abdomen. For some reason, the places that he touched would all feel a little more bearable. Shen Qingqiu caught his breath and couldn’t help but say, “Uh, my dear friend, where… are you touching?” If this was the past, he really wouldn’t have cared about where other people (referring particularly to those of the same sex) touched him. They could touch him wherever they wanted to, please do as you wish. But ever since Luo Binghe had opened a series of doors to a whole new world for him, the worldview that Shen Qingqiu had formed during his past twenty or so years had received a heavy blow. From now on, he would have to use an entirely new outlook and sensitive attitude to view this world. Especially the problem of making friends with those of the same sex! That person made an ‘ah’ noise and hastily let go. He apologized, “I’m sorry. I… didn’t do it on purpose.” Shen Qingqiu said, “No no no! Go ahead and touch! Please continue! Thank you!” It wasn’t a mistake. When this person let go, Shen Qingqiu instantlystarted to hurt again. It seemed that this person… could truly placate the ancient demon blood! Shen Qingqiu turned his head. Underneath the moonlight, he couldn’t make out the other person’s features very clearly, but it was more or less the outline of someone with bright and delicate features. His eyes were extremely limpid, overlapping and reflecting Shen Qingqiu’s figure and the clear, shining moonlight like dew. Shen Qingqiu looked at those eyes and faintly remembered something, but before he could think about it more deeply, his head suddenly felt as if it had exploded. It hurt so much that he let out a low moan before he buried his head downwards and slammed his fist violently onto the ground. All of a sudden, Shen Qingqiu felt someone lift him by the back of his robe. There was a pain in his lower jaw as his mouth was forced open and a liquid was poured in. His tongue felt numb from the acid reflux from his stomach, and he couldn’t taste what the flavor of the liquid was, but it shouldn’t be anything that tasted good. He choked and wanted to spit it out, but that person covered his mouth. Though his movements were forceful, his tone was extremely gentle, and he coaxed, “Swallow it.” Shen Qingqiu’s throat bobbed violently, and in a moment of haste, he actually swallowed that liquid. A bit of the unknown fluid trickled from the corner of his mouth, and he lowered his head as he coughed violently. That man stood to the side and patted his back, helping him calm down. Shockingly, after this liquid entered his mouth and stomach, the agony from the blood worms’ biting, which had tormented him the entire way, swiftly disappeared. Shen Qingqiu’s body felt better, but his heart grew tight instead. He grabbed the clothing at that person’s chest with one hand. “What did you give me to drink?” The other person uncurled Shen Qingqiu’s hand, finger by finger, and took it away from his chest. He smiled slightly and said, “Does it still hurt?” It didn’t hurt anymore. It really didn’t hurt anymore. But the reason it was scary was because it didn’t hurt anymore. He had never heard of something like ancient demon blood having an antidote! As his sense of taste slowly returned to his tongue, Shen Qingqiu felt the scent of blood in his mouth grow even stronger. Strong to the point that he almost wanted to vomit. The original work said it very clearly: there was no medicine that would be effective against ancient demon blood.Only ancient demon blood could keep the ancient demon blood in check. Fuck. Not only did he drink it twice, he drank the ancient demon blood of two different people. Shen Qingqiu felt that he could really fucking be considered someone with neither predecessors nor successors in this world. After thinking this, Shen Qingqiu let out a cheerful sigh and toppled over. The sound of flesh being ripped apart. Also accompanied by the distant and hoarse sound of miserable screaming. Shen Qingqiu pressed a hand against his temples, and the scene before his eyes slowly cleared. An ocean of blood. A mountain of corpses. Luo Binghe stood woodenly in this purgatory-like environment. He wore all black, so it couldn’t be dyed with the color of blood, but half of his face was splashed with spots of dark red. The sword in his hand rose and fell callously like a machine. Originally, when Shen Qingqiu saw Luo Binghe, the image of him hugging his own corpse and rolling off the bed with it should have surfaced on its own in his mind, and it should’ve been hard to look straight at him. But right now, Luo Binghe was actually massacring the things that he had created in his own dreamscape. This was the same thing as him taking a knife and using it to stab his brain. What was the difference? If he wasn’t intellectually disabled and didn’t know better, then only a lunatic would do something like this! Even though Shen Qingqiu always liked to say that Luo Binghe was a masochist and loved to torture himself, there was no way Shen Qingqiu could squeeze out a few dry laughs and find the time to roast him if he tortured himself to this degree. Luo Binghe lifted his head and looked at him with hazy eyes, seeming as if his mind was unclear. But the moment his eyes reflected Shen Qingqiu’s figure, they lit up instantly, and he threw his long sword far, far away. He hid his bloodstained hands behind his back and called in a quiet voice, “Shizun.” Afterwards, he suddenly remembered that his face was also bloody and used his sleeves to wipe at the traces of blood on half of his face, as if he was trying to save himself. But the more he wiped, the dirtier it became, and he grewmore and more uneasy like a child who was caught red-handed for stealing something. It was difficult the first time, but easy the second. Shen Qingqiu now had experience pretending to be the product of artificial intelligence 176 , so he felt quite calm. When he spoke, he couldn’t help but make his voice gentle. “What are you doing?” Luo Binghe said quietly, “Shizun, I… I lost you again. This disciple is useless. He can’t even protect your body.” When he heard this response, Shen Qingqiu’s expression and state of mind were similarly complicated. So, just then, when he was brutally killing the things he had created in his dreamscape, it could be considered that he was… disciplining himself? Looking at how skilled Luo Binghe was at this, Shen Qingqiu was afraid that this was not the first time he had done so. No wonder Luo Binghe was unable to even differentiate if he was a figment of his imagination or an intruder from the outside world last time. Shen Qingqiu sighed and deliberated for a bit before he comforted him softly, “It’s fine if you lost it. I don’t blame you.” Luo Binghe stared blankly at him. “… but right now, that’s all I have left.” Shen Qingqiu suddenly didn’t dare to look directly into his eyes. Could Luo Binghe have really hugged his empty shell of a corpse, which Shen Qingqiu didn’t even want anymore, for five years? Luo Binghe’s voice suddenly cooled down. “After Huayue City, I swore that I would never lose Shizun in this life again. But I still let someone else snatch you away.” The resentment and dark red color in his eyes were similarly turbulent and ingrained. The sword that he had tossed away flew up into the air from his summoning, and it pierced through the chests of several ‘people’ who were dying and struggling. The sound of screaming filled his ears, and Shen Qingqiu hastily restrained him and reprimanded, “Don’t be reckless. Even if it’s just a dream, this is the same thing as harming yourself. Don’t tell me you forgot!” Of course Luo Binghe wouldn’t have forgotten. He stared straight at Shen Qingqiu before gripping the back of his hand. He said only after a long pause, “I know that I’m in a dream. Only in a dream would you scold me like this, Shizun.” When he heard this, Shen Qingqiu suddenly woke up to reality. Not good. Wrong.He couldn’t treat Luo Binghe like this. If you didn’t have that kind of intention towards someone, then you shouldn’t give him hope. The bigger his hopes, the bigger his disappointment. He would continue to be delirious, and the probability of him going crazy would also increase. Even if it was in a dream, he still shouldn’t drag things on fussily like this. He had to make a firm decision or else if their relationship continued to be ambiguous, then it would only lead to misfortune. Shen Qingqiu firmly withdrew his hand and adjusted the look on his face, adopting his best aloof and unapproachable expression before turning and walking away. When Luo Binghe was thrown off, he was stunned for a moment before he instantly caught back up to him. “Shizun, I know that I was wrong.” Shen Qingqiu said coldly, “If you know that you were wrong, then don’t follow me.” Luo Binghe said anxiously, “I’ve long since regretted it, but I just never knew how to tell you. Are you still mad that I forced you to self-destruct your soul? I’ve already completely repaired the spiritual network in Shizun’s body, I’m not trying to trick you at all! As long as I can enter the Mausoleum, I will definitely find a way to wake you up again.” Shen Qingqiu didn’t answer, hesitating over whether or not he should say something a little crueller so he would forget this idea. But Luo Binghe suddenly rushed over and hugged him from behind, embracing him firmly, and he refused to let go even if he rolled on the ground screaming. Shen Qingqiu’s entire body went stiff when he was embraced and felt as if he was brushed by something feathery, making all his fine hairs stand straight up. He collected energy in his hand but still didn’t strike out in the end. He gritted his teeth and forced out one word: “Scram!” He said that after the blackening, they wouldn’t go down the tragedy path! Don’t push and pull back and forth! Luo Binghe acted as if he couldn’t hear him. “Or is Shizun angry over what happened at Jinlan City?” Shen Qingqiu said, “Correct.” Luo Binghe still refused to let go and murmured, “When I first returned from the Endless Abyss, I knew that Shizun declared to the outside world that I was killed by the demon race. At first I thought that Shizun was being tender- hearted and still had some lingering sentiment for me, and that you didn’t want me to lose my reputation. Unexpectedly, after we met and I saw Shizun’s attitude, I became afraid that it was just my wishful thinking again. I was scaredthat the reason Shizun covered up the truth for me was only because you felt that it would stain your name if others found out you brought up a demon.” He spoke pathetically, sentences tumbling one after another out of his mouth as if he was afraid that Shen Qingqiu would rudely cut him off and not let him continue. “I’m really not the one who arranged for the sowers. At the time, I was just so angry that I grew confused, and so I allowed Shizun to be locked in the water dungeon… I’ve known for a long time that I was wrong.” If this was the Luo Binghe from reality, there might never be a time when he would pour out his words so steadily, disregarding his image. It was likely he would only ever dare to ramble so much in a dream that he created. If Shen Qingqiu pushed him aside now, it would be just like giving a tearful, trembling, heartbroken young maiden who finally worked up the courage to call her Chicken Soup for the Soul 177 ‘big sister’ a slap right in the face. It was truly a bit too cruel. Shen Qingqiu felt empathetic and greatly moved, but he also felt that this was all extremely ridiculous. What was more ridiculous than finding out that the person you did everything you could to run away from during the past few years didn’t even want to kill you, but wanted to do you instead? But no matter if it was killing or fucking, the end result was still the same. Shen Qingqiu would still run away as fast as he could. One person wanted to see the other but couldn’t, so he hugged a corpse for five years. The other person wanted to do all he could to avoid the first person, but he still felt like he saw him too much. Shen Qingqiu’s hands were stiff. He raised them before lowering them again, clenching them into fists before relaxing. Finally, he ended up sighing and patting that head which was even taller than him. He thought, “Heavens, I’ve really lost!” Never mind his harem, a perfectly fine dark stallion protagonist didn’t have anyone else and was still a virgin. He had made himself like this, so if Shen Qingqiu continued to strike back, it seemed a little too unkind. Shen Qingqiu still lost to Luo Binghe, who had single-handedly made himself very tragic, as well as his own sympathy. Luo Binghe instantly seized his hand tightly. Shen Qingqiu felt that the skin of Luo Binghe’s palm was slightly uneven against the back of his hand, and when he looked closely, he discovered that it was a sword wound. At first, Shen Qingqiu didn’t understand how he got so many scars on his body, but at that moment, he suddenly remembered. During their nightrendezvous at Jinlan City, Luo Binghe had played a game of cat and mouse with him the entire way. When he finally caught him, Shen Qingqiu had stabbed him. At that time, Luo Binghe had caught the edge of the Xiu Ya sword directly with his own hand. As for the wound on Luo Binghe’s chest near his heart, Shen Qingqiu even more so shouldn’t have forgotten that one. That was the injury from when he had accidentally stabbed him when he was forcing him down into the abyss during the Immortal Alliance Conference. It seemed like every time he had gone to stab Luo Binghe, he had never once dodged. He never avoided or evaded it, but caught it head on, letting Shen Qingqiu stab him, allowing him to pierce him. This was exactly why Shen Qingqiu had struck him, even though both times Shen Qingqiu didn’t actually want to stab him. After being stabbed, Luo Binghe didn’t even go to treat his wounds. Instead, he deliberately preserved them."
"沈清秋道： “ 我救过你一次 , 你也救过我一次了 , 两清了。 ” 他说的 “ 救过你一次 ” ，是指那时拦着公仪萧 , 没让他杀了蛇男。竹枝郎却摇头 , 道： “ 不止于 此。如果不是沈仙师 , 在下恐怕再过数年也无法靠近日月露华芝。怎么能说是两清了？ ” 沈清秋一听，正合他意 , 说： “ 那好，打个商量，你不能直接把两道这玩意儿都从我血里抽 出来吗？一定要留在里面吗？ ” 这就像是你身体里长了一条寄生虫，对付这条虫子的治疗办法居然是放进另一条寄生虫来 和它抗衡。怎么想情况都更糟糕了！ 竹枝郎道： “ 在下这也是头一次动用天魔血 , 此前还从未听说过有什么方法可以消解的。 ” 好吧 , 血液入体 , 溶于无踪，要再把它分离出来，的确也 …… 不太实际。 竹枝郎道： “ 虽然不能释解，但只要在下的血也在沈仙师体内，那位的天魔血就无法起作 用。去魔界之后，无法起到追踪之效，也绝不能折磨于你。 ” 打住。 沈清秋道： “ 等等。我什么时候说过，我要去魔界了？ ” 竹枝郎道： “ 很快就会去了。 ” 沈清秋观察他神色，道： “ 你说的 ‘ 报答 ’ ，该不会是要带我去魔界吧？ ” 逗他呢？去魔界干啥？物资匮乏文化风俗格格不入，还会水土不服。 而且目下有件更需要担心的事。他之前被洛冰河接近于恋尸癖的行为吓到头脑发热，让柳 清歌把自己原先的身体带走了，洛冰河会不会一怒之下，把苍穹山给一锅端了啊？！ 他得先回去和诸位同门通个气。沈清秋立刻掀开被子，打算跑路，谁知，刚一动作，就感 觉一条又滑又黏的冰凉柔软事物顺着腿爬了上来。 一条碧青色的蛇从被子中缓缓探出头来，正朝沈清秋嘶嘶吐出鲜红的蛇信子。 这蛇三指粗细，乍看形似人界毒蛇竹叶青，眼泡极大，瞳孔极小，对比之下，触目惊心。 沈清秋却不怕这类软体生物，冷眼看着，手中悄悄凝力，正想出其不意、捏爆它七寸，碧 蛇突然身躯弓形后仰，红口大张。 明明是一条蛇而已，嘴里居然发出人嗓一般刺耳至极的尖叫，同时开花似的在蛇头四周炸 出了无数根密密麻麻的绿色倒刺，刺尖泛着鲜红，蛇身更是打了气一样膨胀了几倍。 刚才还能算娇小可爱的观赏蛇，现在就他妈是个怪物，魔界品种果然凶残。沈清秋立刻打 消了用手直接接触的念头。 竹枝郎斟满了一杯茶，放到桌上，诚挚地道： “ 沈仙师为何不听我说完就要走？在下是真 心想报答白露林不杀与相助之恩。 ” 沈清秋扯了扯嘴皮： “ 要我去魔界，不去就放这种东西到我床上来，算是 ‘ 报答 ’ ？ ” 竹枝郎笑了笑，道： “ 不只是床上。 ” 又有一条拇指粗细的小蛇从沈清秋衣服里滑出来。 这一条一直盘在他衣服里，被体温温热了，窝得舒舒服服，刚才也一动不动，沈清秋居然 一直没觉察到它的存在。 “ 嘶嘶 ” 声不断中，床底下流水一般爬出了无数条大小粗细不一的 青蛇，铺满了整间房的地面。 沈清秋沉默半晌，道： “ 蛇族？ ” 竹枝郎自若道： “ 家父正是南疆蛇族。 ” 怪不得他叫这个名字。 魔族对阶级和血统方面非常重视，平民或血统低贱的魔族不允许在名字后称 “ 君 ” 。沈清秋 琢磨着，这个字是个代表地位和阶级的后缀，就像帝王名讳不可侵。 洛冰河之所以上位期间略不顺遂，就是因为诸位魔君对他人类混血的那一部分颇有微词。 至于 “xx 郎 ” 这种名字的角色，在魔界副本前期被洛冰河打死不少。所以沈清秋断定，后面 带这个字的，不说都是贫民窟，至少出身不会多好。 竹枝郎无疑属于天魔血系，却不能称君，问题肯定出在混血的一方身上。 蛇族群居活跃在魔界南疆，严格地来说，还是算魔族，但这一族本体是巨蛇形态，生下来 是就是这样，随着年龄增长和修为提高，极少一部分会慢慢化为人形，退去鳞片。但更多 的是终生保持蛇形。 沈清秋道： “ 令堂是？ ” 竹枝郎道： “ 家母天琅君之妹。 ” 天琅君的妹妹好歹也算是魔界公主一样的人物了，是有多想不开，跟谁不好、非要跟一条 蛇生孩子，太尼玛重口了！！！ 沈清秋忍受着那两条蛇在他大腿和小腹上慢慢磨蹭，道： “ 这么说，你算是洛冰河表哥 了？ …… 我说，你不能让它们别往我 …… 衣服里面爬了吗？ ” 竹枝郎道： “ 若单论辈分，的确是可以这么说。它们似乎十分喜爱沈仙师，在下也没有办 法。 ” 鬼才信你没有办法！ 沈清秋忍了，问道： “ 你为什么会在幻花宫？ ” 竹枝郎很有耐心，道： “ 原本是去处理正事，却不想看到了沈仙师。 ” 沈清秋心中一动： “ 正事？你说的正事，可是与洛冰河相关？ ” 联手称霸？魔族反目？还是 # 痛哭流涕，失散多年一家团聚抱头痛哭 # ？ 这次，竹枝郎却笑而不答。 沈清秋道： “ 恐怕不是认亲这么感人肺腑的正事吧。 ” 竹枝郎从容道： “ 在下只是听从君上指令。 ” 沈清秋问： “ 你这具身体，是日月露华芝塑造的？ ” 是他自己用了倒还好说。如果日月露华芝不是他给自己用的，那就可能是拿去给天琅君塑 身了。天琅君被山压着，吊了一口气支撑了这么多年，原先的躯壳恐怕早已损毁，一旦金 蝉脱壳，还真不知要先出什么风浪来。 想想这蝴蝶效应真够了不起的，他似乎放出了了不得东西啊！ 没得到回应，沈清秋继续问： “ 要我去魔界，也是你家君上的指令？ ” 只要涉及到天琅君的问题，竹枝郎就闭口不答，只是礼貌地微笑，令人十分窝火，他还彬 彬有礼。沈清秋便不追问了。竹枝郎见他败兴，这才开口道： “ 请沈仙师好好休息，如有 需要请提出，在下一定为您办到。最迟明天，就发出前往边境之地。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 你有钱吗？ ” 竹枝郎道： “ 有。 ” 沈清秋； “ 我能用吗？ ” 竹枝郎： “ 请随意。 ” 沈清秋： “ 我要女人。 ” 竹枝郎愣住了。 沈清秋重复道： “ 不是你说如果有需要尽量提、请随意吗？我要女人。 ” 这是沈清秋第一次来花楼这种地方。 以往身为清静峰峰主，自持身份，纵使千般好奇抓心挠肝，也坚持过勾栏不得入。现在反 而有机会了。 竹枝郎坐于桌边，不动如泰山。沈清秋身旁花团锦簇，香粉扑鼻。 沈清秋道： “ 你那是什么眼神？ ” 竹枝郎移开目光，道： “ 只是 …… 略感惊讶。沈仙师居然也会对这烟花之地有兴趣。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 你待会儿就知道，我对什么有兴趣了。 ” 正说着，一旁款款上来个新的歌姬，怀抱琵琶，坐在花登上，开始咿咿呀呀地唱起来。 沈清秋原本在留心别的事，无心听曲，可听了两句，突然觉得听到了两个非常了不得的东 西，叫停道： “ 姑娘，你这唱的是什么？ ” 那女子娇声道： “ 奴家唱的是新近流行的弹词。 ” 沈清秋黑线道： “ 不对，我刚才好像听见你唱了两个名字？能重复一下么？ ” 琵琶女举袖掩口而笑，道： “ 有什么不对的？先生莫非从没听过？的主角，本来就是这沈 清秋和洛冰河呀。 ” …… …… …… 这他妈啥时候都被人编成流行的弹词了？！ 竹枝郎原本拒绝一切服务，安静地坐在一旁，可惜肩膀微微耸动暴露了他。 沈清秋道： “ 呃 …… 我能问一下，这个 …… 什么山恨，它讲的是个什么故事吗？ ” 身旁数女叽叽喳喳讲道： “ 先生这个都不知道么？这春山恨，讲的是沈清秋与其爱徒洛冰 河之间缠绵悱恻、禁断不可言说的 ……” 沈清秋呈石化状态从头坚持听到尾。 整理了一下，总而言之，就是一对没羞没躁的师徒，整天在某座不知名的山上不务正业啪 啪啪、下山打怪也啪啪啪，生出误会可以用啪啪啪来解决，死前还要来一发啪啪啪、死后 继续啪啪啪的 …… 故事。 琵琶女幽幽一叹，指尖在琴弦上一拨，道： “ 生前不解对方心中情意，死后与尸同寝，此 等深情，当世无双。 ” 众女也跟着唏嘘不止，更有甚者，已感动落泪。 沈清秋把头深深埋入掌中。 哦草，这他妈不就是个小黄曲吗？！ 谁写的弹词？！ 春山是什么山？！ 清静峰吗？！ 苍穹山吗？！ 苍穹山派分分钟灭你满门好么？！ 究竟是为什么，好像全天下，不仅八卦流传之广遍及边境之地，连坊间的淫词艳曲都要拿 他们来做文章，好像他们 = 跟洛冰河当着所有人面滚床单被抓奸在床了一样！ 竹枝郎噗嗤笑出了声，转过身来，道： “ 沈仙师 …… 就是对这个 …… 弹词有兴趣吗？ ” 沈清秋冷冷看着他。竹枝郎忙正了脸色，却还是憋得辛苦，改口道： “ 天色已明，沈仙师 ，该上路了。 ” 沈清秋扶额道： “…… 走吧走吧。 ” 竹枝郎似乎松了口气。然而，他正要起身之时，忽然身形一滞，僵在凳子上。 沈清秋窥他颜色，笑了笑，问道： “ 怎么？终于感觉到身体不适了吗？ ” 他站起身来，抖了抖衣服，一直赖在他怀里的青蛇噼里啪啦摔了一地，滚落着露出黄黄的 肚皮。 厅中女子惊叫一片，那琵琶女直接把琵琶摔了出去。 竹枝郎扶着额头，撑着桌子站起身来，摇摇晃晃，盯着沈清秋，举起右手，抓了一把从袖 子里钻出的小蛇，却都缠在他手指间，毫无攻击力。 竹枝郎摇了摇头，虚声道： “…… 雄黄。 ” 整座花楼，不知不觉间，早已浸在雄黄酒的气味之中。 沈清秋点头道： “ 雄黄酒，顺便一提，都是用你的钱买的。 ” 羊毛出在羊身上。找女人是假，找帮手是真。 帮手不一定非要会飞天遁地，楼里的姑娘接了钱，悄悄买下了整个镇上的雄黄酒，围着煮 ，对着煮，煮一晚上，绝不可能熏不晕蛇族。 竹枝郎不是没防，只是防的是沈清秋联系其他修士，却没防这些花楼的姑娘，终归是大意 了。 竹枝郎一抬头，眼白已变成金色，瞳孔以肉眼可见的速度拉长拉尖，脸部也开始变形。 沈清秋迅速打开门，对挤在一旁瑟瑟发抖的花娘们说： “ 走不走？ ” 姑娘们立刻争先恐后跑了出去，琵琶女跑在最后，沈清秋塞了一袋银子在她腰里，算是赔 她的琵琶，反手一关门，再回头，竹枝郎原先站的地方，已经盘起了一条三人合抱的碧青 色巨蛇。 这巨蛇头部巨大，呈三角状，黄色的铜铃大眼，瞳孔是极细的一条线。似乎昏昏沉沉，细 细的脖子撑不住沉重的蛇头一般，不时下坠。 雄黄酒效果出乎意料，居然让竹枝郎显出了原形，这下沈清秋有点儿头疼了。 他拿起一旁被人遗落的折扇，展开摇了摇。巨蛇朝他游来，绕着转了两圈，似乎要把他缠 住，沈清秋轻而易举便跳了出来。 蛇身翻滚纠结，喝醉了一样破楼而出，摔倒街道中央，把过往行人吓得尖叫四下逃窜。沈 清秋也跟着跳下楼，喝道： “ 出来也没用，整个镇上都是雄黄酒的味道！ ” 巨蛇口中发出尖啸，在路上摇头甩尾，沈清秋决意把它引出人流密集处，飞身跃上蛇头， 只要方向不对、或者要撞到行人或者民居，沈清秋就用扇子在它头侧一戳，这蛇鳞片有如 铠甲，在地上爬行发出轰隆隆的巨响，沈清秋常常要在扇上灌注大量灵力，才能让他改变 方向。就这么勉强驾驶着它朝镇外滚去。 楼里的姑娘收了钱，办事尽心尽力，也不知煮了多少雄黄酒，那气味被风一带，远远飘 散。 好容易来到一处山脚下，这味道还从上坡源源不断地传下来，巨蛇被这气味熏得难受，又 被沈清秋戳戳捅捅骑了一路，筋疲力尽，再也爬不动了。 沈清秋见已远离城镇，这才跳了下来。巨蛇有气无力，耷拉着脑袋，蜷成山路十八弯。 沈清秋道： “ 虽然我对填坑很有兴趣，不过对移民魔界不感兴趣，而且眼下有更要紧的 事。既然你也不能解天魔血，报恩甚的也就不必了。喜之郎，再见！ ” 他生怕酒味过了，竹枝郎变回原形又放出一堆蛇来缠他，跑得飞快。在下一座规模稍大的 城中找了间十分可靠的连锁店铺，租了一把飞剑。 是的，没看错，的确是租的，就像出租车一样，仙剑是可以租的！而且价格非常之公道划 算！ 总而言之，还是用了竹枝郎的钱，沈清秋双手合十感谢这位仁兄一番，御剑向苍穹山派飞 驰而去。 不过半天光景，一座十二峰高低错落、延绵起伏的苍翠仙山出现在云海雾浪中。 久违了。苍穹山。 沈清秋默默把刚才脑海里冒出的春山两个字划掉。","CHAPTER 52: ETERNAL REGRET OF THE CHUNSHAN 178 Not long ago, Shen Qingqiu would still have been able to believe that Luo Binghe was naturally still holding a grudge and kept the scars so he could remind himself of his hatred at any time. But now, Shen Qingqiu could not deceive himself any more about the meaning of these actions. After reading that long a novel, even after raising him from childhood, he had never discovered that Luo Binghe was actually a pure-hearted young man. This deeply emotional stallion protagonist, after becoming a cut-sleeve, went so far as to completely drop the ‘stallion’ part of his character. This Luo Binghe, who he had raised bent to who knows where, had a heart more delicate than a young maidenboth a masochist and easy to harm. Or maybe it wasn’t that he had never discovered it, but that he had never thought to find out. When all was said and done, Shen Qingqiu had still regarded Luo Binghe as the protagonist in a novel and himself as an observer from afar, occasionally playing around for his own amusement. Most of the time he had kept himself at a distance. In his eyes, he had superimposed an image of the original Luo Binghe who had the strongest presence onto reality, attaching the most importance to that model of behavior. Even though Shen Qingqiu felt that this kind of Luo Binghe was extremely inconvenient to deal with, he was really at a loss for what to do. He was still wracking his brain for solutions and, from this angle, couldn’t see the wisp of a twisted smile that tilted the corner of Luo Binghe’s mouth. After waking, Shen Qingqiu opened his eyes and saw a snow-white muslin veil above him. Someone pushed open the door and walked in. Lightly closing the door behind them, they said, “You’re awake?” Shen Qingqiu rotated his neck and looked at the other out of the corner of his eye. Under the light of lanterns and the warm moon, that man was indeed born with a good face. The corner of his mouth held in a smile, and he was clearly of incomparable intelligence and talent. His eyes, especially, exhibited a kind of warm and quick-witted air. He knew this pair of eyes. Eyes that had risen from Lushui Lake 179 . Shen Qingqiu rolled to a seated position and an ice bag fell from his forehead. The man stooped to retrieve it and placed it on the table, replacing itwith a new one. Upon seeing this, Shen Qingqiu would be embarrassed to say the flood of “Who are you”s and “What do you want”s piling up under his tongue. Coughing once, he said with a reserved tone, “Many thanks to your distinguished self for your assistance in escaping Huan Hua Palace.” That young man stood up by the table and said, smiling, “Humans have a saying, a drop of kindness is repaid as a gushing spring 180 . Besides, the kindness that Master Shen offered me far surpassed a drop.” First of all, this young master was indeed that snake man from Bai Lu Forest. Second of all, this young master knew that the person under this shell was Shen Qingqiu. Shen Qingqiu sounded out a name. “Tianlang-Jun?” The reason why the ancient line of Heavenly Demons was called “Heavenly” was because, according to legend, their bloodline had chosen to fall from grace and leave the heavenly realm to become demons. Only a Heavenly Demon with a lineage purer than Luo Binghe’s could suppress the Heavenly Demon’s blood within Shen Qingqiu’s body. In that case, a problem arose. Of the Heavenly Demon lineage, Shen Qingqiu knew, the original work had only named two: Luo Binghe, and his father. Who else could it be? But he couldn’t strike gold more than three times 181 . Shen Qingqiu’s genius riddle-solving method, which had succeeded every time to date, finally hit a wall here. The man shook his head and said, “Master Shen, treating me as Junshang is really an excessive honor.” Hearing these two characters “Junshang,” Shen Qingqiu finally knew which character this person was. At the opening of the original work, Tianlang-Jun had already been suppressed under a high mountain. As for this war of many years past, Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky only roughly covered the matter because it had little to do with the protagonist’s slaughtering and stallion habits. He merely said that Tianlang-Jun was “no match for a siege by the combined powers of the cultivator magnates of the Human Realm, he was suppressed under XX mountain, eternally unable to turn around, separated from his trusted general and confidant by death or injury.” Which mountain was XX mountain, exactly? Shen Qingqiu had never properly considered this question. But after his curiosity was piqued, he finallyrecalled what XX mountain was. Bailu Mountain! Bailu Forest on Bailu Mountain! Shen Qingqiu looked the man up and down. So this was Luo Binghe’s father’s “trusted general and confidant!” Looking at him now, he already could see no trace of his snake-like deformities. Shen Qingqiu swallowed and said, “May I venture to ask you, sire… what is your distinguished name?” The man said, courteously, “Tianlang-Jun’s second-in-command, Zhuzhi- Lang 182 .” His words had only just left his mouth when the System gave a notification: Repaired completeness of storyline and unlocked secret character, B points +300. Activated plot hole filling event, B points + 100! A burst of uncontrollable excitement suddenly welled up in Shen Qingqiu. “Plot hole filling” definitely referred to those behind-the-scenes deceitful massacres and assassinations with unclear explanations or setup bugs in the original work. This was the number one reason for Shen Yuan’s disdain for Proud Immortal Demon Way . It was also a big reason for him beating his chest and stomping his feet, gnashing his teeth in anger and resentment after finishing the novel. Now, he had drawn out a character that had never directly appeared on stage, and the System had opened a plot hole filling event. Could it be that, next, he would finally uncover the truth behind those giant plot holes ripping through the sky? Shen Qingqiu said, “I saved you once, you also saved me oncewe’re even now.” The “saved you once” he spoke of was referring to that time he kept Gongyi Xiao from killing the snake man. But Zhu Zhilang shook his head and said, “More than that. If not for Master Shen, I’m afraid my humble self would not have been able to approach the Sun and Moon Dew Flower Seed for many more years. How could you say we’re even already?” Shen Qingqiu understood his reasoning. “Okay, we can discuss this. Can’t you immediately extract these two things from my blood? Do you have to keep them in?” This was like if you had a parasite in your body and the doctor’s treatment method was to put in another parasite to fight it. No matter how you think about it, the situation is even more terrible!Zhuzhi-Lang said, “En… this was the first time my humble self utilized Heavenly Demon’s Blood. Before this I really have never heard of any means of dispelling it.” Though the answer dampened his spirits, Shen Qingqiu still expressed his understanding. After the blood entered the body and dissolved without a trace, it truly would not be reasonable to separate it again. Zhuzhi-Lang said, “Though it cannot be dispelled, so long as my blood is also in Master Shen’s body, that person’s Heavenly Demon’s Blood cannot be activated. After going to the Demon Realm, there will be no trail to follow and there will be no way he can torment you any more.” Wait. Shen Qingqiu said, “Hold on. When did I say that I wanted to go to the Demon Realm?” Zhuzhi-Lang said, “We’re going very soon.” Shen Qingqiu examined his expression and said, “The ‘repayment’ you spoke ofit wouldn’t happen to be taking me to the Demon Realm?” What were they going to do in the Demon Realm? It was short in supplies and natural resources, the culture and custom were incompatible, and he would not be acclimatized to the environment. In addition, there was a whole pile of more urgent worries right under his eyes. Before, while his brain was scared into meltdown by Luo Binghe’s near-necrophiliac behavior, he had let Liu Qingge get away with his original body. Would Luo Binghe clear out Cang Qiong Mountain in anger 183 ? He had to return and clear the air between everyone involved. Shen Qingqiu immediately tossed the quilt aside, planning to run away. Who knew that just as he started to move, he would feel something both smooth and sticky, soft and ice cold crawl up his leg? A jade-green snake slowly stretched its head out from the quilt, flicking a scarlet tongue towards Shen Qingqiu with a hiss. This snake was three fingers thick and, at first glance, was similar to the venomous Chinese green tree viper of the Human Realm 184 . The eye sockets were extremely large and the pupils were extremely small, and the contrast shocked the eye and astonished the heart. But Shen Qingqiu did not fear this type of soft-bodied animal. Looking at it with a cool glance, he stealthily collected spiritual power in the palm of his hand, planning on catching it off guard and snapping off seven inches. Suddenly, the jade-green snake reared back, red mouth gaping open.To the eye it was merely a snake, but from its mouth it issued an ear- piercing shriek that could have come from a human throat. At the same time, thickly packed green darts exploded from behind its head like a blossoming flower. The sharp tips were suffused with scarlet red; it was obvious to see that they were extremely poisonous. The snake’s body inflated several times like it had been pumped up with air. Just a moment ago it could have been said to be a dainty and cute ornamental snake, but now it was some sort of fucking monster. The Demon Realm variety was certainly savage. Shen Qingqiu immediately dispelled any intention of touching it with his bare hands. Zhuzhi-Lang poured out a cup of tea. Placing it on the table, he said cordially, “Master Shen, why do you try to leave as soon as I finish my explanation? I sincerely wish to repay your kind assistance from Bailu Forest.” Shen Qingqiu bit at his lip. “You want me to go to the Demon Realm, and if I don’t go you’ll put this kind of thing in my bed. Is this your ‘repayment’?” Zhuzhi-Lang smiled and said, “Not only in your bed.” Another small snake that was as thick as a thumb slid out from Shen Qingqiu’s clothes. This snake had been coiled in his clothes all along, and having been warmed by his body temperature was nesting comfortably, not moving a bit. Shen Qingqiu didn’t even notice its presence. With an unceasing hiss, a flood of countless green snakes, some thick some thin, crawled out from under the bed, carpeting the whole floor. Shen Qingqiu stayed taciturn for a while, then said, “The Snake Race?” Zhuzhi-Lang said calmly, “My father was from the southern border.” No wonder he was called this name. The Demon Race attached very much importance to social class and lineage. Common demons or demons with lowly lineages could not take the title “Jun.” Shen Qingqiu thought it overthis part of his name was a suffix representing his social status, like how one must not encroach upon the taboo name of the emperor. Luo Binghe’s time occupying the top seat had not gone smoothly, and this was because the demon Juns had much to say about the human portion of his mixed blood. As for the characters with the kind of name “XX-Lang,” Luo Binghe had killed more than a few in the early stages of the Demon Realm plotline. So, Shen Qingqiu concluded, those with this character weren’t all slumming it in caves, but at least were not of extraordinary origin. Zhuzhi-Lang undoubtedly belonged to the Heavenly Demon bloodline, butcouldn’t take the title of Jun. The issue was definitely mixed blood. The Snake Race lived in a community on the southern border of the Demon Realm. Strictly speaking, they still counted as part of the Demon Race, but their bodies took the form of giant snakes. They were born like this, and with increasing age and cultivation very few transformed to take a human appearance, shedding their scales. Most of them stayed in snake form their entire lives. Shen Qingqiu said, “Who is your honored mother?” Zhuzhi-Lang said, “Tianlang-Jun’s younger sister.” In any case, Tianlang-Jun’s younger sister counted as something like a princess of the Demon Realm. How much can you fret over it, that out of everyone, she had to have a child with a snake ━ this kink is too fucking hardcore! Shen Qingqiu endured those two snakes dawdling on his leg and stomach and said, “So, you are technically Luo Binghe’s cousin? … I say, can’t you tell them not to… crawl into my clothes?” Zhuzhi-Lang said, “Only speaking of seniority, that certainly can be said. They seem to be very fond of Master Shen; there’s nothing my humble self can do.” Who would believe there’s nothing you can do! Shen Qingqiu endured it and asked, “Why would you go to Huan Hua Temple?” Zhuzhi-Lang said with much patience, “I originally went to take care of official business. I never thought I’d see Master Shen.” Shen Qingqiu’s heart gave a jump. “Official business? This official business you speak of, does it have to do with Luo Binghe?” Linking hands to declare themselves tyrant? Conflicts within the Demon Realm? Or was it a situation of “moving the sky and the ground, a deeply emotional demon family reunion after many years of separation, crying on each other’s shoulders”? This time, Zhuzhi-Lang smiled and did not answer. Shen Qingqiu said, “I’m afraid it wasn’t a touching situation of visiting new in-laws after a marriage kind of official business.” Zhuzhi-Lang said, unhurriedly, “I was only obeying my lord’s orders.” Shen Qingqiu asked, “This body, was it molded from the Sun and Moon Dew Flower Seed?” If he had used it for himself, that was not a problem. But if he had not used the Sun and Moon Dew Flower Seed on himself, then it was probable that he used it to create a body for Tianlang-Jun. Tianlang-Jun had been suppressedunder the mountain, propping himself up on a single breath for this many years. His original body was likely long ruined. But, if he could make like a cicada shedding its carapace, Shen Qingqiu really didn’t know what wind and waves would arrive. Shen Qingqiu had a not-entirely-wonderful premonition, that this careless flap of a butterfly’s wings had released an impressive monster. Not having received a reply, his mind could not be put to rest. He continued, “Taking me to the Demon Realm, was that another one of your lord’s orders?” Whenever his questions touched upon the topic of Tianlang-Jun, Zhuzhi- Lang clammed up and refused to answer, only giving a polite smile which made others choke with resentment. Only when Shen Qingqiu finally withdrew in defeat, he opened his mouth, still with his typical refined and courteous manner. “Rest well, Master Shen. If you have any needs please say and I will definitely handle them for you. We can depart for the borderlands tomorrow at the latest.” Shen Qingqiu said with a dry mouth and tongue, “Do you have money?” Zhuzhi-Lang responded, “I do.” Shen Qingqiu: “Can I use it?” Zhuzhi-Lang: “As you wish.” Shen Qingqiu: “I want women.” Zhuzhi-Lang stared blankly. Shen Qingqiu repeated, “Wasn’t it you who said if I had a need I should bring it up, feel free to do as I wish? I want women. Get rid of the snakes.” A slight crack finally split open Zhuzhi-Lang’s smiling expression. After quite a while, he did as instructed. Shen Qingqiu hummed a laugh and turned to get off the bed. Putting on his outer jacket, his outfit was complete. Zhuzhi-Lang seemed to hesitate for some time, considering whether to follow. In the next moment, Shen Qingqiu strode out the door and he followed behind like his back leg. Before, as Qing Jing Peak’s Peak Lord, he had to be mindful of his image, and though a thousand curiosities grabbed at his mind and itched his liver, he had persevered in that brothels were not to be entered. But now, he had the opportunity. Shen Qingqiu treated Zhuzhi-Lang, following behind, as if he were nothing. Strolling a lap around the town, he picked the intimate-looking “Warm Red Pavilion” and stepped in, completely at ease 185 . Before long, Shen Qingqiu was beside brightly colored decorations as his nostrils were assailed by the scent of talcum powder. Zhuzhi-Lang took a seat beside the round table, unmoving like Mt. Tai. Shen Qingqiu said, “What’s that look on your face?”Zhuzhi-Lang averted his eyes and said, “It’s just… I’m rather astonished. Master Shen would even have an interest in this place of prostitution.” Shen Qingqiu said, “In a moment you’ll see what I have an interest in.” Just as he was speaking, a new songstress leisurely approached. She was slightly older and the cosmetics she wore were somewhat colorful. Hugging a pipa to her bosom, she sat on the floral bench. Meeting eyes with Shen Qingqiu, she seemed startled. Shen Qingqiu didn’t know the reason, and nodded at her. “Young lady?” The songstress snapped out of it and said with an easy smile, “Don’t be apprehensive, mister, you have a very good appearance and it reminded this servant of an old acquaintance ━ my eyes were deceived.” After speaking, she lowered her head and did not bring it up again. After a few clangs and skritches, she started to sing. Shen Qingqiu was originally whispering in the ears of the girls next to him, not caring to listen to the music. But, after hearing two phrases, he suddenly felt that he had heard two very unbelievable things. Calling for the songstress to stop, he said, “Young lady, what is this you’re singing?” The woman said with a tender voice, “This servant is singing the new popular ballad ‘Resentment of Chunshan’.” Shen Qingqiu said, face full of black lines, “That’s strange ━ just now I seem to have heard you singing of two names? Could you repeat those?” The pipa player smiled behind her sleeve and said, “What’s strange about it? Could it be that Mister never heard? The leading roles of ‘Resentment of Chunshan’, it goes without saying, are those two Shen Qingqiu and Luo Binghe, ah.” … … … When did they fucking get made into a popular ballad? Zhuzhi-Lang was declining all service, quietly sitting to the side and pretending to be empty air. What a pity that he exposed himself when his shoulders faintly shook. Shen Qingqiu said, “Uh… could I ask, this… eternal regret of whatever mountain, what story does it tell?” The women next to him said in a chorus of chirping voices, “Mister, you don’t even know this? The Resentment of Chunshan tells of the lingering sorrow of unspoken desire between Shen Qingqiu and his beloved disciple Luo Binghe, the forbidden and taboo…”Shen Qingqiu persevered and listened to the story in a petrified state from head to tail. To clear up the plot, in short, this was a shameless master-disciple couple, spending all day on some nameless mountain ignoring their duties to papapa, going down the mountain to fight monsters and papapa, using papapa to settle misunderstandings, still needing a round of papapa before dying, continuing to papapa after death, continuing to papapa as before after resurrection… story. The pipa player sighed faintly, plucking a string with her fingertip. “Never having understood the affection in the other’s heart in life and laying with the body after death, this level of deep love is truly matchless in this age.” All the women followed with incessant sighs and sobs, not to mention, had already begun to shed tears of emotion. Shen Qingqiu buried his head deeply in his hands. How damnable, is this some fucking porn?"
"苍穹山派外设有空防结界 , 非本门仙剑不得未通告入境，擅自入境即被打偏轨道，沈清秋 便在山脚停下 , 把飞剑遣回去，顺便换了身衣服，弄了个斗笠来戴戴。 山下小镇常有修士往来 , 今天却没看到多少 , 沈清秋正微觉奇怪 , 有人问道： “ 这位仙师 , 您这 …… 可是要上苍穹山派去？ ” 沈清秋点头。那人又道： “ 现在去 , 不大好吧？ ” 沈清秋心一紧 , 问道： “ 怎么个不好法？ ” 那人与其他几人面面相觑 , 道： “ 您还不知道吧？这山上，已经被围两天了。 ” 过山门，上登天梯，居然连一个守山弟子也没有遇到，沈清秋心中不祥预感越发强烈，一 跃数阶，飞奔而上。 越往上走，越能看清，穹顶峰上好几处天空都浓烟滚滚，夹杂电闪雷鸣。 穹顶峰之巅，狼藉一片，火烧林，冰锥满地，檐角损毁，看来经过了几场恶战。穹顶殿外 ，阵营分明的双方正对峙着。一方是人界修士，有站有躺，木清芳穿梭其中忙碌。另一方 是身披黑铠的魔界士兵，黑压压呈排山倒海之势。虽然似乎暂时停战，可只要有人剑多出 鞘一寸，必将重新引爆空气中的火药味。 看来洛冰河已经不屑于掩饰身份了，沈清秋并不惊讶。原著洛冰河暴露自己血统，也差不 多是这个阶段。魔界上位已成定局，幻花宫也从里到外都被他洗脑，整治得服服帖帖，站 稳脚跟，自然不需再遮遮掩掩。只是撕破脸皮的前景提要不同罢了。 峰上弟子虽都必须穿校服，但也有不少成名修士不必受此拘束，沈清秋一身格格不入的装 束倒也没人太过在意，他挤到殿前，往里张望。 岳清源闭目而坐，柳清歌在他身后，手掌与他背部相接，两人身体四周灵力波动似乎不太 稳定，恐怕都情况不好。 再见这两位掌门师兄和倒霉师弟，他们貌似又是被自己坑成了这样，沈清秋无比内疚，再 一转头，呼吸滞了滞。 洛冰河沉沉地站在大殿另一侧。 他穿玄色，衬得皮肤白得透明，眼睛极黑，却又极亮，表情冷淡，却仿佛有两团鬼火在瞳 孔中熊熊燃烧跳跃。漠北君立在他身后，虽然是副手的位置，却微微昂头，宛如一尊理所 当然趾高气扬的冰雕。 在真实世界中再次亲眼看见洛冰河，沈清秋实在很难形容此刻的复杂心情。 此人固然是他不幸一生的罪魁祸首，可现在思来，似乎常常都是他自己理解错了洛冰河， 乱搞一气，才让事情变得更糟糕。他有责任，他承认。而且洛冰河也被他坑得不轻。因此 ，虽有尴尬，却无憎恶厌惧。 这就像看到一个妹子爱你爱得死去活来，就算她再丑，或者你再对她无感，至少也没办法 讨厌她。虽说洛冰河不是妹子（却比妹子还麻烦），也绝对跟丑是极端反义词。 岳清源睁开双眼，齐清萋急道： “ 掌门师兄，你 …… 无恙吧？ ” 岳清源摇了摇头，望着洛冰河，缓缓道： “ 昔年魔族攻上苍穹山派，阁下作为抵御魔族的 一份子迎战，你师父更是以一身护下整个穹顶峰，不想今日，却也是你率领魔族，将苍穹 山逼至如此境地。 ” 洛冰河淡淡地道： “ 若非贵派逼人太甚，我也不想这样。 ” 齐清萋气极反笑： “ 哈！哈！苍穹山派逼人太甚，真该让天下人来听听。你这白眼狼叛出 师门、忘恩负义倒也罢了，逼自己师父在面前自爆，之后连死人都不放过，拿他尸体不知 道做些什么见不得光的事，现在倒反咬一口，究竟是谁逼人太甚？！ ” 洛冰河对她的嘲讽充耳不闻，木然道： “ 下一个是谁？我要摘这题字了。 ” 沈清秋一惊，抬头望去。洛冰河说的题字，恐怕指的是穹顶殿中，高悬在上的横幅牌匾。 “ 苍穹 ” 二字是苍穹山派祖师之一亲手所题。年岁久远，意义非凡，相当于苍穹山的一块脸 面。谁要摘了这题字，就相当于是扇了苍穹山派的脸一巴掌。 当年纱华铃贸贸然率一众武将围上穹顶峰，打的就是把这题字摘回魔界耀武扬威的主意。 齐清萋道： “ 你要战便战，一会儿烧个洞府，一会儿毁一座山门，现在又要来摘这题字， 算是什么意思？零碎折磨不肯给个痛快？ ” 岳清源道： “ 齐师妹稍安勿躁。 ” 他站起身来，虽处劣势，神色却稳如泰山，不乱军心，道 ：“ 清秋师弟的仙身已安置在殿内，他是我苍穹山派的人，更是清静峰的人，身陨后必然 要下葬清静峰历代峰主墓林中，入土为安。阁下除非把苍穹山派尽数抹杀，否则，只要本 门有人一息尚存，无论耗上多久，清秋师弟的尸身绝不会交予你手。 ” 在场数人齐声喝道： “ 正是如此！ ” 沈清秋就知道他们会是这个态度。正是因为苍穹山派一定会尽全力护住他那具躯壳，沈清 秋才必须要回来和他们通气。 初时的震惊和慌乱过后，沈清秋静心想想，也想通了。尸体不过是尸体而已，洛冰河要便 拿去，随他怎么高兴怎么玩。他本人回来，苍穹山撒手不管便是。可他来的毕竟迟了。 洛冰河一扯嘴角，笑得冰凉。他低了低头，慢条斯理道： “ 我绝不会亲自对苍穹山动手。 也不会杀一名苍穹山派的门人。可我有的是时间，慢慢耗。 ” “ 慢慢耗 ” 三个字，一个一个，清晰地砸在沈清秋耳朵里，他忽然整颗心往下沉去。 洛冰河绝不会是这么客客气气和你玩儿文斗的人。懒得虚与委蛇地伪装之后，他想要某派 的任何东西，他就会采取最直接有效的方法：血洗，杀光，然后拿走。 可洛冰河居然能这样有耐心耗了两天，不像是有了这种闲情逸致，反而更像是在等着什 么。 比如，等着沈清秋自己出来。 沈清秋攥紧了拳头。 洛冰河道： “ 动手。 ” 漠北君 “ 哦 ” 了一声，上前一步，忽然道： “ 我已经动手很多次了。 ” 殿外那一堆爆炸的冰刺和坑坑洼洼的地表墙面，都是他的杰作。 洛冰河道： “ 那就随便找个人，代你动手。 ” 漠北君点了点头，伸手在后一捞，捞出个畏畏缩缩的人。 他把这人拎小鸡一样拎了出来，扑通一声，扔到双方中间那一大片空地上。 尚清华魂飞魄散地爬起来，苍穹山派众人一看他，眼睛里都要喷出火来了。 何止他们，沈清秋也要眼睛嘴巴里狂喷怒火：坑爹的向天打飞机菊苣啊草草草！！！ 齐清萋刷的一下拔出佩剑，喝道： “ 叛徒！ ” 尚清华赔笑道： “ 齐师妹，有话好好说。不要舞刀弄剑的 ……” 齐清萋早就一剑刺过去，怒 道： “ 谁是你师妹！ ” 尚清华连忙避开，往漠北君身后躲。漠北君毫不留情，一脚把他踹回 来。尚清华苦着脸道： “ 我也是逼不得已，你别这样，让别人看咱们同门相残的笑话。 ” 太不要脸了。尚清华真是比他想象的还没节操，现在还能说出这种话，真是太不要脸了！ 齐清萋骂道； “ 谁跟你是同门？仙盟大会你放魔物进去，想过死伤的苍穹山派弟子是你同 门？叛逃去魔界，想过我们是你同门？今天跟这混世魔王打上山来，你也有脸自称同 门？！ ” 两人在殿中你追我赶，简直是一场闹剧。沈清秋在一旁看着，心潮随之起伏： “ 砍砍砍 …… 砍死他！我艹！就差一点儿！师妹砍他胯【下！！！ ” 那头鸡飞狗跳，这头，却是谁也笑不出来。 柳清歌撤去加在岳清源背后的灵力，平息完毕，站起身来。乘鸾在鞘中战栗不止，嗡鸣不 息。 杨一玄握拳道： “ 师尊，你已经和那魔头打了一天了！ ” 柳清歌沉声道： “ 退下。 ” 洛冰河看他一眼，笑了笑，轻声道： “ 手下败将。 ” 他说得声音不大，可吐字清越，尾音上扬，整个大殿的人都能听到。柳清歌握剑的手紧了 紧，眼中电光流闪。没有什么，比 “ 手下败将 ” 这个词更能让百战峰峰主感到更耻辱的。 杨一玄脾气冲，当即反击道： “ 魔界杂种！ ” 洛冰河不以为意： “ 是。我是杂种。整个苍穹山派被一个杂种挑了，光彩吗？不止穹顶峰 ，余下各峰我可以一一挑遍，让世人都知道，修真界泰斗苍穹山派被一个杂种杀得无还手 之力，如何？ ” 宁婴婴凄然道： “ 洛 …… 洛冰河，是不是连清静峰，你也要一把火烧了才高兴？ ” 洛冰河想也没想，立即道： “ 不。 ” 他似乎有一瞬间的微怔，顿了顿，才说： “…… 清静峰 一草一木，一竹一舍，如任何人敢损毁分毫，决不轻饶。 ” 柳清歌鼻子里哼一声，乘鸾暴起： “ 惺惺作态。 ” 剑气掠过洛冰河脸颊，带得他发丝横乱。洛冰河把手放到腰间所悬的佩剑上，讥笑道： “ 不自量力。 ” 然而，两把剑最终还是没有再次交锋。 沈清秋站在两人中央，双方剑气激荡碰撞，立即把他原本就是戴着做做样子的斗笠切为两 半。他左手指尖夹住乘鸾剑锋，不让柳清歌再进攻一寸；右手则把洛冰河已经按在心魔上 的手牢牢压住，不让他出鞘。 其实完全没必要再打下去了。 沈清秋看看左边，再看看右边，还没说出这句话。洛冰河猛地反手拽住他手腕，仿佛一只 冰箍牢牢套了上来。 洛冰河脸上的笑容几近扭曲，一字一句道： “ 抓到了。 ” 饶是沈清秋早有心理准备，这时近距离看着这张脸，也忍不住毛骨悚然。 片刻的鸦雀无声后，殿中轩然大波顿起。 岳清源错愕万分，声音微微发抖： “ 可是 …… 清秋师弟？ 齐清萋连尚清华都忘了去砍，后者连忙趁机滚回漠北君身后。宁婴婴拽拽瞠目结舌的明帆 ，喃喃道： “ 大师兄，我没看错吧？怎么回事，那是 …… 师尊？！ ” 明帆道： “ 好像是 …… 又好像 …… 不是？ ” 杨一玄则格外画风不同，他震惊道： “ 这身法不是绝世黄 …… 黄前辈吗？！黄 …… 前辈为 什么长着沈师伯的脸？ ” 谢谢你没把整个 id 说全啊！ 柳清歌猝然睁大双眼，素来的无波无澜被搅得裂了一脸。 他说： “…… 你没死？ ” 沈清秋原本愧疚而感激的心情碎成了渣渣。他不能接受地说： “ 师弟你这是什么表情？师 兄没死你不高兴吗？ ” 柳清歌脸色青了又黑，黑了又白，五颜六色，好不精彩。不少人也跟他差不多。沈清秋还 没接下一句，一只手把他的脸掰转过去。洛冰河道： “ 总算舍得出来了？ ” 沈清秋被他抓得骨头都快断了，只有腿能动，又不能当众提膝盖踹他关键部位，那太不雅 了。想到一事，隐隐又有怒火翻上来。 他说： “ 你故意的。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 师尊指什么？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 你不直接屠山，而是慢慢地耗了这么久，就是为了引我出来。 ” 洛冰河冷笑道： “ 师尊也有偶尔猜对弟子心思的时候呢。徒弟真是欣喜若狂，恨不能捶胸 顿足，一定终生铭记此刻。 ” 柳清歌撤了剑，身子晃了晃，似乎还有些晕头转向，指指洛冰河，道： “ 你，放开他。 ” 洛冰河把沈清秋往怀里拖了拖，不耐烦道： “ 你说什么？ ” 他动作强硬，沈清秋深吸一口气，压下去的那股郁火又蹿起三尺高： “ 你什么时候知道梦 里那个是我的？ ” 要不是被洛冰河发现了破绽，又怎么会猜到他没死成，在苍穹山成功守株待兔？ 洛冰河道： “ 师尊未免太看不起我。就算第一次我没怀疑，第二次还不发觉异常的话，那 就是真的蠢了。 ” 沈清秋点头道： “ 你不蠢。我蠢。 ” 也就只有他蠢破天际，才会以为洛冰河真的神智不清到分不清外来入侵者和幻境产物。 沈清秋道： “ 既然发现异常，你为什么不拆穿？ ” 陪着演师慈徒孝戏码很好玩么？ 洛冰河看着他： “ 为什么要拆穿？师尊不也被我哄的很开心？ ” 开心？ 呵呵。 沈清秋闭嘴不答，他继续悠悠地说下去： “ 有好几次，我都差点能顺着梦境探查到师尊你 的所在地。若是那样，也不必有今天这一出了。 ” 洛冰河脸色又渐转阴沉，掐着他肩膀，十指用力，恨声道： “ 或者一开始，师尊就不要逃 跑，不要瞒我，那么很多事都会完全是另一种样子。 ” 敢情闹这么大，始作俑者居然是他自己。而且这逻辑听起来，真的很有道理。说的很对！ 某些方面来说，沈清秋觉得这个结论挺正确的。不作不死，他一直在作，所以死成什么德 行也是活该。 只是，沈清秋的确吃软不吃硬。可你不能让他吃完之后再啪啪打脸。说：装的。 洛冰河根本不是娇弱惹人怜惜的小白花。沈清秋在梦里跟他腻歪那么久，想着反正洛冰河 以为是做梦，安慰安慰他也没啥，沈清秋什么黏糊糊的抚慰话都说出来了，又是摸头又是 给抱，事后自己都被矫情得起了一身鸡皮疙瘩。 一想到自己在梦里真的为此烦恼，但其实这些都在对方掌控之中，沈清秋忽然有种恨不得 挖个缝钻坑里去的无地自容。 太难看了。","CHAPTER 53: MASTER AND DISCIPLE MEET AGAIN Who wrote this ballad? What mountain was Chunshan referring to? Qing Jing Peak? Cang Qiong Mountain? The Cang Qiong Mountain sect can wipe out your entire family, okay? Just why did the gossip spread everywhere, including the border territory, to the point that even the flowery love songs on the streets used them as material? It was as if he and Luo Binghe had been caught having sex in front of everyone in the entire world! Zhuzhi-Lang burst out laughing. He turned around and said, “Is Master Shen … very interested … in this ballad?” Shen Qingqiu looked at him coldly. Zhuzhi-Lang hastily adjusted his expression, but it was still hard for him to hold back. “It… it’s best if my humble self withdraws for a moment…” However, he was just about to stand up when his body suddenly stalled, and he stiffened on his stool. Shen Qingqiu snuck a look at his expression before laughing a bit. He asked, “What? Does your body finally feel out of sorts?” He stood up and shook out his clothes. The green snakes that were lounging in his lap fell onto the floor with a patter, tumbling around and revealing their yellow underbellies. The women in the hall started to shriek out of fear, and the woman playing the pipa immediately threw it down. Zhuzhi-Lang placed a hand on his forehead and stood up using the support of the table, swaying. He stared at Shen Qingqiu and lifted his right hand, grabbing a handful of small snakes which slipped out of his sleeve, but they all just wound themselves around his fingers, no strength to attack whatsoever. Zhuzhi-Lang shook his head and said weakly, “Realgar 186 .” Somehow, the entire extravagant building had long since been soaked in the scent of realgar wine. Shen Qingqiu praised, “Top-quality realgar wine. Also, might I mention that it was all bought with your money.” Nothing came for free. Looking for women was fake, looking for assistants was real. The assistants didn’t necessarily need to know how to fly or burrow into the ground; with a whisper in their ears, the girls in the building tookthe money and secretly bought all the realgar wine in the town. They surrounded the Warm Red Pavilion and fanned the wine as they boiled it for an entire night. If Zhuzhi-Lang didn’t faint from the fragrance, then he wouldn’t be part of the Snake Race. It wasn’t that Zhuzhi-Lang wasn’t on guard; it was only that he was on guard against Shen Qingqiu contacting other cultivators, not the girls in the building. In the end, he had been careless. Zhuzhi-Lang lifted his head. The whites of his eyes had already turned gold, and his pupils were lengthening and sharpening at a speed visible to the naked eye. His face was also starting to change shape. Shen Qingqiu quickly opened the door, and he asked the maidens squeezed next to the door, “Are you going or not?” The girls immediately scrambled to get outside, the woman playing the pipa at the very end. Shen Qingqiu adeptly stuffed a bag of coins into her pocket; it could be considered compensation for her pipa. He closed the door with a flip of his hand, and when he looked back again, an enormous, jade green snake whose width was so large that three people wouldn’t be able to encircle it with their arms, was now coiled where Zhuzhi-Lang had been standing. This enormous snake’s head was huge and triangular, its eyes bronze-yellow, its pupils an extremely thin line. It seemed to be dizzy, as if its slender neck couldn’t support its heavy head, which drooped from time to time. The effect of the realgar wine was beyond expectations. It actually made Zhuzhi-Lang reveal his original shape, which made Shen Qingqiu’s head hurt a little. He picked up a folding fan from nearby that somebody had left behind before opening it and fanning it. The enormous snake slunk towards him and wound two circles around him, as if it wanted to bind him in place. Shen Qingqiu leaped out easily. The snake rolled over and twisted together before breaking out of the building, as if it were drunk. It crashed into the middle of the street, causing the passersby to shriek and flee in all directions. Shen Qingqiu also followed after him and jumped down from the building, shouting, “It’s no use if you come outside either. This entire town is full of the scent of realgar wine!” A sharp hiss came from the enormous snake’s mouth, and it shook its head and thrashed its tail in the street. Shen Qingqiu decided to draw him away from places where there were a lot of people, and he quickly leaped lightly onto its head. As long as the snake went in the wrong direction or was about to crash into pedestrians or houses, Shen Qingqiu would jab the fan into the side of its head. The snake’s scales were like armor, creating an enormous rumbling noise as itcrawled along the floor. Shen Qingqiu often had to pour large amounts of spiritual energy into the fan to make it change direction, and so he forcefully drove the snake outside of the town. After the girls in the building received the money, they went all out. He didn’t know how much realgar wine they boiled, but the scent was scattered far away by the wind. With great difficulty, they arrived at the foot of a mountain, and the scent was still floating steadily down from uphill. The enormous snake was overwhelmed with discomfort from the smell, and it had also been prodded and stabbed by Shen Qingqiu the entire way here. It was extremely exhausted, and it couldn’t crawl any further. Shen Qingqiu saw that they were already far away from the town, and he finally jumped down. The enormous snake was weak and powerless, its head drooping down as it curled up across the mountain path several times. Shen Qingqiu said, “Even though I’m very interested in filling plot holes, I’m not interested in immigrating to the Demon Realm. Also, I’m under a lot of pressure right now. Since you can’t remove the ancient demon blood either, there’s no need to repay the debt of gratitude. Xizhi-Lang 187 , goodbye!” He was afraid that after the aroma of the wine wore off, Zhuzhi-Lang would return to his original shape and release another pile of snakes to annoy him, so he ran away extremely quickly. At the next slightly larger city, he found a very reliable chain store and rented a flying sword. No, you didn’t read that wrong. He indeed rented it. Just like renting a car, flying swords could be rented as well. Moreover, the price was extremely fair and cost-effective! In the end, he still used Zhuzhi-Lang’s money. Shen Qingqiu placed his palms together and thanked his dear friend before he sped off on the flying sword towards Cang Qiong Mountain. About half a day later, twelve verdant green mountain peaks of varying heights appeared from the sea of clouds and mist, rising and falling along the mountain range. It had been a long time. Cang Qiong Mountain. Shen Qingqiu silently crossed out the word ‘Chunshan’ that had just appeared in his mind. There was an air defense formation set up outside of the Cang Qiong Mountain sect, and flying swords that weren’t from the sect couldn’t enter without advance notice. If one entered without permission, they would be knocked off course, so Shen Qingqiu stopped at the bottom of the mountain andsent the flying sword back. Along the way, he changed into a different outfit and found a bamboo hat to wear. There were often cultivators passing through the small town at the bottom of the mountain, but today he didn’t see very many. Shen Qingqiu was just thinking that it was a little strange when somebody asked, “This Immortal Master, do you… want to go up to the Cang Qiong Mountain sect?” Shen Qingqiu nodded. The person spoke again. “It’s probably not very good to go now, right?” Shen Qingqiu’s heart tightened, and he asked, “Why is it not very good?” The person shared a glance with the others around him. “Do you not know? This mountain has already been surrounded for two days.” After passing through the sect gate and climbing the stairs up the mountain, Shen Qingqiu unexpectedly didn’t see a single disciple guarding the Peak. The ominous feeling in Shen Qingqiu’s mind grew stronger and stronger, and he leaped up several stairs at once, rushing up the mountain. The further up he went, the more clearly he could see that much of the sky around Qiong Ding Peak was covered with thick, roiling smoke, mixed with flashes of lightning and the sound of rolling thunder. At the summit of Qiong Ding Peak, everything was a mess. Fire burned through the forest, and ice was scattered all over the floor, the edges of the roof collapsed and destroyed; it seemed like several fierce battles had occurred here. Outside of Qiong Ding Hall, the two factions were clearly facing off against each other. One side consisted of cultivators from the Human Realm, some standing and some lying down, as Mu Qingfang bustled among them. The other side consisted of soldiers from the demon race, draped in black armor, dark and intimidating. Even though it seemed like they had ceased fire temporarily, as long as somebody’s sword left its sheath by an inch, it would undoubtedly reignite the spark in the air. It seemed like Luo Binghe already felt that it wasn’t worth hiding his identity anymore. Shen Qingqiu wasn’t surprised. The original Luo Binghe had exposed his own lineage at around the same time. His influence as the one at the top of the demon race was already solidified, and he had also brainwashed Huan Hua Palace from the inside out, so it was docile and obedient under his control. With a solid foothold, he naturally wouldn’t need to continue concealing his identity. The only thing was that the general summary of the scene where he revealed himself was different, that’s all. Even though the disciples of the Peak all had to wear uniforms, there werealso quite a few famous cultivators who weren’t subject to this restriction. Shen Qingqiu’s unsuitable attire didn’t really attract that much attention, and he squeezed to the front of the hall, peering in. Yue Qingyuan sat with his eyes closed, Liu Qingge behind him with his hand on Yue Qingyuan’s back. The spiritual energy fluctuating around their bodies seemed to be somewhat unsteady; most likely, both of their situations weren’t too good. When he looked at his Sect Master senior apprentice brother and unlucky junior apprentice brother and saw how it seemed like they had reached this point only because he had screwed them over, Shen Qingqiu felt a twinge of guilt. He turned his head away once more, and his breathing stilled. Luo Binghe stood darkly at the other side of the hall. He wore all black, which contrasted against his skin, making it seem so pale that it glowed. His eyes were extremely black, but also extremely bright. His expression was cold, and the aura around him made people feel anxious and uneasy. Mobei-Jun stood behind him, and although it was the position of a deputy, he still held his head slightly higher, just like an arrogant ice sculpture who naturally belonged there. Yue Qingyuan suddenly opened his eyes. Qi Qingqi said hastily, “Sect Master senior apprentice brother, are you… well?” Yue Qingyuan shook his head and looked at Luo Binghe. “In the past, when the demon race attacked the Cang Qiong Mountain sect, Your Excellency served as part of the resistance force that met the demon race head on. Your Shizun even more so protected the entire Qiong Ding Peak with his entire being. Unexpectedly, today, you’re also the one leading the demon race, forcing Qiong Ding Peak to this state.” Luo Binghe said indifferently, “If it wasn’t for your sect going too far, I wouldn’t want to do this either.” Qi Qingqi burst out laughing from rage. “Ha, ha! ‘The Cang Qiong Mountain sect going too far’ is really something that everyone should hear. You’re an ungrateful traitor who betrayed your master. It’s one thing if you bite the hand that fed you, but you forced your own Shizun to self-destruct in front of you, and afterwards, you wouldn’t let him go even though he died. Who knows what secret, shameful things you did with his corpse? Now you’re making a false accusation? Just who is going too far?” Luo Binghe acted as if he couldn’t hear her sneering. He said apathetically, “Who’s next? I’m going to remove this engraved sign.” Shen Qingqiu was startled, and he lifted his head up to look. The engravedsign Luo Binghe was referring to was the one currently in the middle of Qiong Ding Palace, suspended high in the air on a horizontal board. The two words on it, ‘Cang Qiong,’ were personally handwritten by one of the Cang Qiong Mountain sect founders. It was extremely old and unusually significant, and it was equivalent to being part of Cang Qiong Mountain’s face. If somebody removed this sign, it would be the same thing as slapping Cang Qiong Mountain right in the face. Back then, when Sha Hualing rashly led a bunch of warriors to surround Qiong Ding Peak, her idea was precisely to remove the engraved sign and take it back to the Demon Realm to show off. Qi Qingqi said, “If you’re going to fight, then fight. First you burn a cave here, then you destroy a gate there, and now you want to remove this engraved sign ━ what’s the meaning of that? Torturing us in bits and pieces, unwilling to be straightforward about it?” Yue Qingyuan said, “Junior apprentice sister Qi, stay calm.” He stood up. Even though they were at a disadvantage, his expression was extremely steady, so it wouldn’t ruin their morale. “Junior apprentice brother Qingqiu’s immortal body has already been settled inside the palace. He’s someone from my Cang Qiong Mountain sect’s Qing Jing Peak. After he passed, he inevitably must be buried in the Qing Jing Peak tomb with the other past Peak Lords, so he may be at peace. Unless Your Excellency completely obliterates Cang Qiong Mountain, no matter how much time you waste, junior apprentice brother Qingqiu’s body will never be handed over to you, as long as someone from my sect still has breath remaining in them.” Numerous people at the scene chorused together, “That’s exactly how it is!” Shen Qingqiu just knew that they would have this attitude. It was precisely because Cang Qiong Mountain would definitely do all that it could to protect his body that Shen Qingqiu had to come back. The corner of Luo Binghe’s mouth tugged, his smile ice-cold. He lowered his head and said unhurriedly, “I will not personally act against Cang Qiong Mountain. Nor will I kill a single member from the Cang Qiong Mountain sect. But what I do have is time that I can slowly waste.” Those two words, ‘slowly waste,’ smashed crisply into Shen Qingqiu’s ears. Suddenly, his entire heart sunk. Luo Binghe absolutely wasn’t somebody who would fight a battle of words with you this politely. With the pressure of unconditional strength, he had no inclination of feigning civility. If he wanted something from a particular sect,he would use the most direct and effective method to do so: bloodbath, massacre, and then take it away. But for Luo Binghe to actually waste two entire days so patiently like thisit didn’t seem like he was in a leisurely and carefree mood, but rather as if he was waiting for something. Such as, waiting for Shen Qingqiu himself to come out. Shen Qingqiu’s fists tightened. Luo Binghe: “Go.” Mobei-Jun made an ‘oh’ noise and took a step forward before he suddenly said, “I already went many times.” The piles of exploded ice shards, and the floor and walls filled with holes outside of the hall, were all part of his masterpiece. Luo Binghe said, “Then pick someone to fight on your behalf.” Mobei-Jun nodded. He stuck his hand out behind him and fished out a quaking person. He lifted this person out like he was carrying a baby chick before he threw him with a thud onto the stretch of empty ground between the two sides. Shang Qinghua climbed up, terror-stricken. When the Cang Qiong Mountain sect’s people saw him, their eyes looked like they were about to shoot out fire. It wasn’t just them, Shen Qingqiu was also about to spew raging fire from his own eyes and mouth: the deceptive Great God Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky ah fuck, fuck, fuck! Qi Qingqi drew her sword at once and shouted, “Traitor!” Shang Qinghua smiled apologetically. “Junior apprentice sister Qi, if you have something to say, then say it nicely. Don’t dance around with your sword. You’re so beautiful, if you just act a little gentler then…” Qi Qingqi had already long since struck out with her sword, and she said furiously, “Who’s your junior apprentice sister!” Shang Qinghua hastily evaded her and went to hide behind Mobei-Jun. Mobei-Jun ruthlessly kicked him back. Shang Qinghua said bitterly, “I didn’t have any other choices either, don’t be like this. It’ll make other people laugh at us if they see fellow disciples fighting each other.” Shen Qingqiu was stupefied. Shang Qinghua was really even more lacking in morals than he had imagined. He could still say something like that at this kind of moment ━ this… was indeed a little shameless… Qi Qingqi cursed, “Who’s your fellow disciple? At the Immortal Alliance Conference, when you let demons in, did you think of the Cang Qiong Mountain sect disciples who died or were injured as your fellow disciples? As a traitor who was reduced to the demon race’s lackey, did you think of us as your fellowdisciples? Today you fight your way up the mountain with this world-wrecking demon king, and you still have the face to call yourself our fellow disciple?” The two of them chased each other around the palace, and it was truly a chaotic scene. Shen Qingqiu watched from the side, emotions surging through his mind: “Cut him, cut him, cut him… fuck, just off by a bit! Qi Qingqi, cut off his BEEP! Use effort!” Liu Qingge removed the hand that was on Yue Qingyuan’s back sending him spiritual energy. He had finished calming down, and he stood up. Cheng Luan shuddered incessantly in its sheath, continuously buzzing and ringing. Yang Yixuan clenched his fists and said, “Shizun, you fought that demon for a whole day already!” Liu Qingge lowered his voice. “Step back.” Luo Binghe glanced at him and chuckled before he said quietly, “My defeated opponent.” He didn’t speak very loudly, but his enunciation was clear and melodious. The end of his sentence lilted upwards, and everyone in the entire palace could hear it. The hand that Liu Qingge used to hold his sword tightened, lightning flashing through his eyes. There was nothing that could make Bai Zhan Peak’s Peak Lord feel more humiliated than the words ‘my defeated opponent.’ Yang Yixuan’s temper spiked, and he immediately counterattacked, “Demon Realm bastard!” Luo Binghe was unconcerned. “Yes. I’m a bastard. The entire Cang Qiong Mountain was stirred up by a bastard, isn’t that glorious? Not just Qiong Ding Peak, I can stir up each and every one of the other Peaks as well and let the whole world know that the eminent Cang Qiong Mountain sect of the Righteous path was attacked by a bastard to the point that they didn’t have the ability to fight back. How’s that?” Ning Yingying said, distressed, “Luo… Luo Binghe, will you only be happy if you burn down Qing Jing Peak as well?” Luo Binghe didn’t even think before he replied instantly, “Of course not.” He frowned. “If anybody dares to destroy a plant or tree, bamboo or house, on Qing Jing Peak, I will not let them off lightly.” Liu Qingge snorted through his nose. “What a pretense.” Cheng Luan surged out, and the sword energy swept past Luo Binghe’s cheek, sending his hair flying. Luo Binghe placed his hand on the sword hanging from his waist, and he said in retaliation, “You’re overestimating yourself.” However, in the end, the two swords did not cross blades again.Shen Qingqiu stood in between the two of them. Both of their sword energies swept up and collided, instantly slicing the bamboo hat that he was originally wearing just for show into two halves. He caught Cheng Luan’s sword edge between two fingertips of his left hand, not allowing Liu Qingge to advance a single inch; his right hand firmly restrained the hand that Luo Binghe had already placed on the Heart Devil sword’s hilt, not allowing him to draw the sword. “It’s only a corpse, everyone, it’s only a corpse. There’s no need to be like this, is there!” Shen Qingqiu looked to the left before he looked to the right. He didn’t have a chance to say that line yet when Luo Binghe suddenly flipped over his hand and grabbed Shen Qingqiu’s wrist, and it felt as if an icy band was wrapped sturdily around his wrist. The smile on his face was near distorted, and he said, one word at a time, “Caught you. Shizun.” Even though Shen Qingqiu had long since mentally prepared himself, he still couldn’t resist feeling his blood run cold when he saw this face up close. After a beat of dead silence, a huge racket surged up in the hall immediately. Yue Qingyuan was extremely astonished, and his voice shook slightly. “But… junior apprentice brother Qingqiu?” Qi Qingqi even forgot to hack at Shang Qinghua, and he hastily seized the chance to roll back behind Mobei-Jun. Ning Yingying grabbed Ming Fan, who had a bloody nose and a swollen face, and muttered, “Senior apprentice brother, did you hear that? A-Luo and Sect Master senior apprentice brother said that person is… Shizun?” Ming Fan: “How come he seems like he is… but he also seems like he isn’t?” Yang Yixuan had an extremely different point of view. He said in shock, “Isn’t this Peerless Huang… Elder Huang? Huang… Elder Huang is Shen Shibo 188 ?” Thank you for not saying the entire ID out loud! Liu Qingge’s eyes suddenly widened, and his usual unruffled calm was so disturbed that it spilled over onto his face. He said, “You didn’t die?” Shen Qingqiu’s originally guilty but grateful emotions were smashed into pieces. He couldn’t accept it, and said, “Junior apprentice brother Liu, what kind of expression is this? You’re not happy that your senior apprentice brother didn’t die?” The color of Liu Qingge’s face first went green and then black, black andthen white, all sorts of colors, very unimpressive. Quite a few people were more or less the same as him. Shen Qingqiu didn’t get to continue speaking before a hand turned his face away. Luo Binghe said, “You’re finally willing to come out now?”"
"齐清萋失声道： “ 慢着 , 究竟是怎么回事？！ ” 她指向穹顶殿内： “ 里面的那个 …… 那个难道 不是沈清秋么？为什么又多出来一个？ ” 洛冰河看上去心情不错，道： “ 不如问问前安定峰峰主？ ” 沈清秋： …… 麻痹他就知道肯定少不了尚清华这个没骨气没节操的功劳！ 尚清华呵呵哈哈 , 漠北君横了他一眼 , 他立刻站了出来 , 气沉丹田，昂首挺胸 , 朗声道： “ 沈师 兄他数年前曾偶至一地 , 得一宝器日月露华芝。此芝性灵 , 能重塑肉身，沈师兄就是凭着它 才在花月城魂魄离窍金蝉脱壳！所以 , 里面那个是他 , 不过只剩下个空壳子，外面这个也是 他！两个都是他！ ” 概括精炼 , 简洁明了。 数双眼睛齐刷刷望向沈清秋。 柳清歌立刻把乘鸾剑尖比向了他，杀气比刚才对着洛冰河还重。 初时的震惊过后，岳清源神色转为怔然，低声道： “ 既然如此，为何师弟五年来都杳无音 信，和十二峰断绝联系？难道在你心中，诸位同门都不值得你信任托付？ ” 沈清秋心中有愧： “ 师兄你听我说 ……” 齐清萋气道： “ 沈清秋你 …… 你知不知道师兄他们被你害得多惨！你徒弟们当时都哭成什 么样子了？！成天哭哭啼啼的好好一个清静峰都乌烟瘴气披麻戴孝了一整年让人都不想上 去！峰主之位也空着，你倒在外面是逍遥快活！ ” 沈清秋最怕的就是泼辣的齐清萋指着他鼻子骂，忙道： “ 我真不是故意的，我在土里埋了 整整五年，也才刚醒来没几天，是他干的！ ” 尚清华见矛头又指向了他，更冤枉： “ 怎么又怪我。不是你说要尽快弄熟的吗？ ” 柳清歌按着太阳穴： “ 闭嘴！ ” 尚清华便闭嘴了。 他们这一群人吵吵闹闹，要是换个场景来看，着实滑稽，可因为时机不对，沈清秋一点儿 也笑不出来。 穹顶峰上，火光四起，焦石土木，两天的拉锯和围攻过后，不复平日威严端庄。殿内殿外 ，都有连带血污、受人搀扶的弟子，年轻一辈更是惶惶四望。疲态尽露，已是强弩之末。 而另一方阵中，呈半包围状的黑铠魔族武将和骑兵仍如刚刚磨就的刀锋，锃亮尖锐，虎视 眈眈。 沈清秋收回目光，道： “ 洛冰河，你说，你来苍穹山派，是为了抓我。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 不错。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 你抓住了。 ” 目的达到，该撤兵了。 洛冰河看着他： “ 不跑了？ ” “……” 沈清秋缓缓点头： “ 不跑了。 ” 洛冰河嘴角动了动，露出一个无力的微笑。这个笑容里，总算是没了方才一直明挂在脸上 的讽刺味道。 他轻声说： “ 很多次我都这么以为。 ” 柳清歌忽然道： “ 你什么意思？ ” 他看着沈清秋，像恨不得对着他脑门捅一剑： “ 你这是想用自己交换？ ” 岳清源伸手抚上玄肃，肃然道： “ 苍穹山的人，还轮不到魔族来染指。 ” 木清芳按住他，摇头道： “ 师兄，你闭关期间强行破关而出，对上强敌，本来就吃了大亏 ，现在还勉强拔剑，恐怕真的对你修为 ……” 岳清源面容涌起一阵翻上来的黑气，又强行压下去，勉声道： “ 不行也要行。师弟已经死 过一次，那时候我们没能护住他，难道如今又要我再眼看着他去送死？ ” 这一番言辞，听得沈清秋胸中起伏激荡。他转向岳清源： “ 师兄，你看这满门弟子，受伤 的有多少？两天了，该不该让他们下去？一片狼藉的穹顶峰，该不该休整？ ” 要说沈清秋最佩服敬重之人，排在第一位的，就是岳清源。不但因他对整个门派尽心尽力 ，也因为这份拳拳回护之情。他是真不忍心再让苍穹山派和这位掌门给他操心给他擦屁股 了。 自己作死自己扛。沈清秋道： “ 我教出的徒弟，我惹下的乱子，一人承担足矣。掌门师兄 你身为一派之首，这十二峰所有的弟子安危性命都系于你肩头，定知应该如何做出取 舍。 ” 殿中死寂一片，气氛凝重。 岳清源脸上尽是无奈之色，可身为一山之首，在不利的形势之下，该如何抉择，不言而 喻。各峰峰主也有一样的考量。倒是宁婴婴奔了出来。 她扯住沈清秋手臂，大声道： “ 我不同意！ ” 沈清秋道： “ 明帆，照顾你师妹。 ” 宁婴婴抽泣道： “ 我不要人照顾！魔族妖女那时候也好，金兰城和幻花宫对立那时候也罢 ，总是师尊你自己站出来，这次为什么又要是你？为什么每次都必须是师尊吃亏受难？ ” 沈清秋愣住了。 对啊，为什么每次都是他倒霉？！ 这问题一时半会儿还真想不明白。他摆出个镇定自若的皮面： “ 这么大人了还哭哭啼啼， 像什么样子。为师又死不了。 ” 心里补充一句，大概。 明帆满脸悲愤： “ 师尊，为了苍穹山派，把自己拱手送给这个魔头，岂非生不如死？从来 只听过舍命陪君子，哪有舍身饲魔头的？ ” 怎么说话的？！ 明帆你这熊孩子能说人话么？！ 拖拖拉拉了这许久，洛冰河恐怕早已失去了耐心，他攥住沈清秋一手，另一手放在心魔剑 鞘上道： “ 将师尊仙躯一并带走。 ” 另一位峰主愤愤道： “ 你别欺人太甚，把人带走了不够，还要那尸体干什么？ ” 洛冰河不答，只冲漠北君抬了抬手，下达指令。沈清秋见好不容易妥协了下来，一句不对 ，似乎要再起争端，有心阻止，本想拉他胳膊，却又觉得别扭，改为扯了扯他衣袖，酝酿 一番，才硬着头皮说道： “ 我跟你走便是了，又何必要做到这种程度。 ” 沈清秋说这话的时候，觉得非常耻辱。 他是个男人，却要当着这么多人的面，低声下气地向另一个男人说这种 “ 跟 ” 不 “ 跟 ” 的话。 尤其这男人还曾经是他徒弟，更加憋屈，可耻。 然而，示弱对任何男人都是有一定效果的。洛冰河脸色明显晴朗了不少，不仅抓他的力道 松了些，连语气也柔和起来。 只是语气柔和，内容还是一样的强硬： “ 毕竟是师尊原先的身躯，而且牵涉良多。师尊要 是再来一次金蝉脱壳，弟子就真不知该怎么办了。 ” 他一转脸，声音就冷下来： “ 带走。 ” 漠北君还没动，那头齐清萋侧头听悄然上殿的柳溟烟一阵低语，先是惊诧，随后喝道： “ 不用争了！ ” 她昂首道： “ 洛冰河，现在谁都不用争了。就算我们肯让你带走，你也别想如愿。 ” 沈清秋知道她性子烈，说不准做了什么极端的事情要来激怒洛冰河，正感头疼，谁知，她 示意柳溟烟站出来： “ 溟烟，你说吧。 ” 柳溟烟道： “ 沈师叔的仙身不见了。 ” 她说完便让开了身子，后殿被抬出几名弟子，这些都是在后留守坐化台、看护尸身的人手 ，此刻却都昏迷不醒，从脸到指尖都是诡异的乌青色。 殿中哗然一片。岳清源颜色立变，洛冰河也抬了抬眉。 齐清萋坦然道： “ 洛冰河，你也不用看我。我的确是想过要藏起来，可惜刚刚我让溟烟去 后殿转移，坐化台上已经空了。放在上面由我们妥善保存的尸身已经不翼而飞。 ” 她心里痛快，竟是宁可尸身不翼而飞也不想让洛冰河带走。木清芳附身察看，道： “ 意识 全无，但性命无忧。中毒。 ” 岳清源道： “ 什么毒？ ” 木清芳道： “ 现在判断不出来。身上也没有伤口。待我取血一试。 ” 齐清萋道： “ 若是人界的毒，木师弟一眼就能做出判断，既然他看不出来，我还想问问， 是不是你动的手脚？ ” 洛冰河淡淡地道： “ 我不喜欢用毒。 ” 这的确属实，况且，现在这种情况，洛冰河没必要撒谎，既然说了不是，那就不是他所 为。即是说，居然有不知名者趁双方在殿前争执，神不知鬼不觉混上山来，隔着几道墙， 在双方眼皮底下，把沈清秋的尸体给盗走了。不可谓不惊心。 沈清秋就纳闷了：偷他尸体干什么？？？怎么他活着没人要死了倒成了个香饽饽吗？？？ 还是这个世界的变态真的这么多！ 洛冰河见继续留在这里多说无益，皱起了眉，道： “ 也罢。不管是谁拿走了，总会找到 的。 ” 心魔出鞘，黑气蒸腾，剑锋划过之处，劈开了一道破口般的轨迹。沈清秋提醒道： “ 撤 围。 ” 洛冰河看了看他，生硬地说： “ 如师尊所愿。 ” 柳清歌不由自主走出了一步，动了动嘴唇。沈清秋回头看看苍穹山派众人，再看看他，不 知该说什么。 乘鸾剑尖垂地，往上走，柳清歌的手在袖下握紧，爆裂的虎口鲜血横流，顺着剑身往下滑 落，滴落。 他定了半晌，才吐出两个字。 “ 等着！ ” 这两个字犹如两道冰锥掷出，却挟着沉沉怒火，滔天战意。 洛冰河冷笑： “ 尽管来。 ” 心魔回鞘。 两界裂口连接的，是一条宽敞的石廊。一对一对火把向前无尽延伸，最深处是看不清的黑 暗。 看这石廊两侧的壁画风格，还有阴暗的气氛，就知道这里是洛冰河的魔界大本营， 裂口封闭之后，洛冰河就没再继续钳制沈清秋，慢慢松开手。 沈清秋站直了身，一拍袖子，一语不发。 两人都无话可说，目不斜视，一前一后，脚步都悄然无息，气氛又僵又冷。 沈清秋十分奇怪。 他本以为，再见洛冰河，肢体动作这么多，爽度应该一直往上飙才对  好吧，虽然这么 想是有点不要脸。不，应该说是非常之不要脸。 可系统居然一直沉寂无声，屁都没放一个。 地宫中的岔路分毫不能影响洛冰河的速度。兜兜转转一番，眼前突然豁然开朗。 魔界建筑多盘踞地下，挖空地底，终年不见日月星光，而这一片居然在顶上打穿了地面， 让阳光直射下来，平添不少人气。 推门而入，屋中陈设布局，十分眼熟，居然和清静峰竹舍很是相近。 沈清秋莫名其妙的有些窝火。 他真想对洛冰河说一句：有什么意思呢？舞台剧一样把场景设置好，圈养起来，装作什么 都没发生过，继续玩梦里面师徒相亲相爱的小剧场吗？ 可惜，人在屋檐下，什么都得往肚子咽。 洛冰河朝沈清秋走近了一步。 要再早几天，沈清秋肯定避之不及，近一步退三步，可现在，他反倒不想做躲闪或者缩成 一团之类的动作了，那样看上去像个被暴徒挟持的少女，太装太难看太矫情。即使游龙潜 水虎落平阳（脸真大），但求能保持最后一份优雅风度。 可他还是难免紧张，心紧绷成一弦，指节蜷了蜷，眼皮一跳。","CHAPTER 54: UNHAPPY REUNION Shen Qingqiu was grabbed so hard that his bones were almost broken. Now only his legs could move but he didn’t want to publicly knee Luo Binghe in the groin. Thinking back on everything that had happened, he felt a faint flame of anger rising. Shen Qingqiu said: “You did this on purpose.” Luo Binghe asked, “What does Shizun mean?” Shen Qingqiu said: “You didn’t immediately slaughter everyone in the sect. Instead, you delayed matters for a long time just to draw me out. Luo Binghe smiled bitterly: “It seems that Shizun can occasionally guess his disciple’s thoughts correctly. This disciple is truly wild with joy. I wish I could beat my chest and stamp my feet to engrave this moment in my memory forever.” Liu Qingge withdrew his sword. He swayed and seemed to be somewhat dizzy. Pointing at Luo Binghe, he said, “You, let him go.” Luo Binghe dragged Shen Qingqiu into his arms and said impatiently, “What did you say?” His attitude as he did this was unyielding, causing Shen Qingqiu’s depression, which he had been suppressing, to shoot three feet high. Shen Qingqiu silently took a deep breath and said: “When did you realize that it was me in your dreams?” If Luo Binghe hadn’t discovered that Shen Qingqiu hadn’t died, would Luo Binghe have waited at Cang Qiong Mountain sect like a hunter trying to flush out his prey 189 ? Luo Binghe said, “Shizun looks down on me too much. Even if I didn’t notice the first time, I would be really stupid if I didn’t notice it the second time.” Shen Qingqiu suddenly felt a pain in his knee. Silently, he thought: You’re not stupid; I’m the one who’s stupid. It was only Shen Qingqiu who knew how Luo Binghe cultivated and manipulated his dream abilities to superb effect but Shen Qingqiu thought he was really out of his mind and wouldn’t be able to differentiate between hallucinations and people who invaded his dreamland. Shen Qingqiu asked, “Why didn’t you end the dream when you discovered an anomaly?” Is it fun to act out a “teacher’s devoted and obedient disciple” play?Luo Binghe looked at him. Unexpectedly, he said: “Why would I want to do that? Was Shizun not happy to be coaxed by me?” … Happy? At that time Shen Qingqiu wasn’t happy at all because he was worried about Luo Binghe’s psychological state. However, the facts have proved that everything, including his worries, was under Luo Binghe’s control. After all, this was Luo Binghe, the protagonist. How could he have made such a big mistake 190 , thinking that Luo Binghe had turned over a new leaf and mended his ways, becoming just a lovely, pitiful little white flower? Shen Qingqiu was the type of person who was amenable to coaxing but not to coercion 191 . However, now he felt as though his face had been slapped twice when he realized that Luo Binghe had only been pretending 192 . Qi Qingqi involuntarily cried out: “Slow down, what’s going on?” She pointed inside the Qiong Ding’s palace hall: “The one lying inside… Isn’t that Shen Qingqiu? Why is there another one?” Luo Binghe seemed to be in a good mood as he said: “Why don’t you ask the former An Ding Peak Lord?” Shen Qingqiu: Fuck! He knew that the only thing Shang Qinghua could be given credit for was having no backbone or moral integrity. Shang Qinghua chuckled but immediately stepped forward when Mobei Jun gave him a sidelong look. Head high, chest puffed out, he gathered his wits 193 , and said clearly: “A few years ago senior apprentice brother Shen accidentally found a place that held a treasure, the Sun and Moon Dew Flower Seed. This spirit plant can be molded into the shape of a body. It was with the help of this treasure that senior apprentice brother Shen was able to shed his mortal body at Huayue City. The corpse inside is his but it’s only an empty shell. The one here outside is him, too. Both are him!” This was a succinct summary, very concise and understandable. Several pairs of eyes suddenly turned towards Shen Qingqiu. Liu Qingge immediately pointed Cheng Luan at Shen Qingqiu. The murderous look on Liu Qingge’s face was worse than when he was looking at Luo Binghe earlier. Yue Qingyuan whispered, “In that case, why has there been absolutely no news of you for the past five years? Why did you sever all connections with the Twelve Peaks? Is it because, in your heart, your fellow sect members are unworthy of your trust?” Shen Qingqiu felt guilty at his lack of confidence: “That, senior apprenticebrother, listen to me…” Qi Qingqi sighed: “Shen Qingqiu, you… you’re actually that kind of person! Do you know how badly they were hurt by you, senior apprentice brother? Do you know how much your disciples cried? All day long Qing Jing Peak was filled with the sound of weeping! For one entire year, no one wanted to visit the Peak because it was shrouded in gloom, with everyone wearing mourning clothes! The position of Peak Lord was left vacant while you were happily playing outside, free and unfettered!” The thing Shen Qingqiu was most afraid of was the shrewish Qi Qingqi pointing a finger at him and giving him a scolding. Shen Qingqiu hurriedly said: “I really didn’t mean to do that. I wasn’t happily playing freely outside at all. I’ve been buried in the soil for five years. I just woke up a few days ago. That person who was running around outside free and unfettered, it was all his doing!” When Shang Qinghua saw that the spearhead was pointing at him again, he felt even more wronged: “Why blame me again? Didn’t you say you wanted it to mature as soon as possible?” Liu Qingge pressed his fingers against his temple: “Shut up!” Shang Qinghua shut up. They were a noisy group. In fact, if you looked at this scene a certain way, it probably looked quite funny but Shen Qingqiu thought that the entertainment factor was lost because of the timing. Fires had sprung up all over Qiong Ding Peak and its buildings were scorched black. After two days of fighting and siege, it no longer had its usual majestic and dignified look. Inside and outside the palace hall, there were people with bloodstained faces holding on to another disciple’s hand to stand. The disciples of the younger generation around him seemed panic-stricken. They were exhausted, like an arrow at the end of its flight. On the other hand, the black-armored demon generals and fighters that had half-surrounded the Cang Qiong Mountain sect disciples looked like newly sharpened swords. The demons’ bright eyes were staring at the disciples like tigers watching their prey. Shen Qingqiu turned around to look at the person behind him and said, “Luo Binghe, you said you came to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect to catch me.” Luo Binghe said: “Correct.” Shen Qingqiu said, “You’ve caught me.” Your goal has been achieved. It’s time to withdraw. Luo Binghe looked at him and said, “You won’t run away?” “…” Shen Qingqiu nodded slowly: “I won’t run away.”The corners of Luo Binghe’s mouth turned up in a humorless 194 smile. For the first time, his face showed an expression that was devoid of mockery. He whispered: “So many times, I’ve believed in Shizun so much.” Liu Qingge suddenly said, “Shen Qingqiu, what do you mean?” He looked at Shen Qingqiu as though Shen Qingqiu’s words had just subjected him to extraordinary shame and humiliation: “Bai Zhan Peak’s Lord is here. You’re right in front of me but you intend to sacrifice yourself by surrendering your body to him?” Junior apprentice brother, I can understand that as Bai Zhan Peak’s Lord, you feel that your dignity has been violated, but could you change the words you use? What the devil do you mean by “surrendering your body”? Please change this way of referring to it, thank you! Liu Qingge said: “You’re afraid of being a burden on Cang Qiong Mountain sect but Cang Qiong Mountain sect isn’t necessarily afraid of this burden.” Luo Binghe sneered: “How many unbroken ribs do you have left?” When Yue Qingyuan’s hand grasped Xuan Su’s hilt, Mu Qingfang, who was beside him, said nervously: “Senior apprentice brother sect leader, you forcefully pulled out of closed-door cultivation and sustained grievous injuries at the hands of the enemy. Now you’re barely able to draw your sword. I’m afraid that it will really harm your body…” A burst of black qi suddenly rose to Yue Qingyuan’s face but was forced down again. His voice was strained when he said: “No, impossible. Junior apprentice brother already died once. We weren’t able to protect him then. Do I really have to watch him die again?” Shen Qingqiu’s mind was in turmoil when he heard those words. If one were to list all of the people Shen Qingqiu admired and respected most in the world, Yue Qingyuan would rank first. Not only did he have a powerful, sincere, and earnest desire to protect, but he always did his utmost for the sect as a whole. Shen Qingqiu found it too embarrassing to ask the Cang Qiong Mountain’s sect master to clear up Shen Qingqiu’s mess 195 and pay the bill for him. The one who had courted death was him alone, therefore he should take on this burden alone. Shen Qingqiu said: “I alone can take responsibility for the disciple that I taught. Senior apprentice brother, as the sect master, the well- being of all the disciples of the sect rests on your shoulders. You should know what choice to make.” The hall was silent. Yue Qingyuan’s face was stiff and his knuckles werewhite. Shen Qingqiu was reminding him that, as the leader of a sect that was in a very perilous situation, the proper choice was easy to see. As every Peak Lord was considering this, Ning Yingying rushed forward, grabbed Shen Qingqiu’s arm, and shouted: “I disagree!” Shen Qingqiu said: “Ming Fan, take care of your junior apprentice sister 196 .” Ning Yingying said: “I’m not a child anymore! I don’t need someone to take care of me. During the altercation at Jinlan City and Huan Hua Palace, Shizun, you came forward to solve the problem. Why does it have to be you again this time? Why does it have to be Shizun who suffers each time?” Because I’m the one courting disaster. But at least he managed to raise a normal and filial girl. Shen Qingqiu had been very worried but now he felt somewhat relieved: “It’s not seemly for an adult to weep endlessly like this. Your teacher isn’t going to die.” In his heart, he added the word: Probably… The next moment, Ming Fan, with a face full of grief and indignation, said: “Shizun, wouldn’t death be better than giving yourself to this devil 197 for Cang Qiong Mountain sect’s sake? Who has ever heard of a gentleman who gives his own life to feed a devil?” What are you saying? Ming Fan, you little brat, can you speak human? This long delay made Luo Binghe impatient. He grabbed Shen Qingqiu’s hand, put his other hand on the Heart Devil’s hilt, and said: “I’ll be taking Shizun’s immortal body, too.” Another Peak Lord said indignantly: “That’s going too far! Isn’t it enough for you to take one person away? What are you going to do with a corpse?” Luo Binghe didn’t answer. Instead, he gestured to Mobei Jun then gave him instructions. Seeing this, with great reluctance, Shen Qingqiu decided to compromise. One wrong word and another dispute could arise. To prevent this, Shen Qingqiu wanted to pull on Luo Binghe’s arm but felt too embarrassed to do that. Instead, he pulled on Luo Binghe’s sleeve. He hesitated for a while then summoned up all his courage and said: “I’m going to accompany you so why do you have to do this?” When he said that, Shen Qingqiu felt extremely humiliated. He was a man but in front of so many other people, he had to whisper “accompany you” in a conciliatory tone 198 . The fact that this person was once his disciple made him feel even more resentful. This situation was disgraceful. However, showing one’s weak side had a certain effect on men. The expression on Luo Binghe’s face visibly became sunny and cloudless. Not onlydid his grip on Shen Qingqiu loosen, but even his tone of voice also softened. Nonetheless, even though his tone was soft, his words were still as harsh as before: “Shizun’s original body is still very important. After all, if Shizun’s soul leaves his current body again like a cicada casting off its skin, this disciple wouldn’t know what to do.” As soon as Luo Binghe turned his head away from Shen Qingqiu, his voice became cold: “Take it away.” Before Mobei Jun could move, Qi Qingqi, who had been listening to Liu Mingyan quietly whispering to her in the upper hall, first looked surprised then became calm and said: “Stop arguing!” She raised her head and said: “Luo Binghe, there’s no need to argue over this now. Even if we were to allow you to take it away, your wish can’t be fulfilled.” Shen Qingqiu knew she was hot-tempered and didn’t know if she might say something extremely infuriating to provoke Luo Binghe. Shen Qingqiu had a bad feeling about this but, unexpectedly, she motioned Liu Mingyan to forward: “Mingyan, tell them.” Liu Mingyan: “Shen Shishu’s 199 immortal body is missing.” She stepped aside after she finished speaking and from behind her a few disciples were carried out. These were the disciples who had been at the ceremonial 200 platform guarding the corpse. The disciples were all unconscious and their bodies from their faces to their fingertips were a strange bluish black color. There was an uproar in the hall. Yue Qingyuan’s facial expression changed and Luo Binghe raised his eyebrows. Qi Qingqi said calmly, “Luo Binghe, you needn’t give me that look. I really wanted to hide it but, unfortunately, I had just told Mingyan to go to the hall, only to find that the platform was empty. The corpse that we placed on it and preserved, as was appropriate, has disappeared.” She seemed delighted and spoke cheerfully. Unexpectedly, she would rather the corpse sprout wings and fly away than be carried off by Luo Binghe. Mu Qingfang examined the disciples and said: “They are unconscious but their lives are not in danger. It’s poison.” Yue Qingyuan said: “Which poison is it?” Mu Qingfang said: “I can’t tell right now. They have no wounds. Let me take a sample of their blood to test.” Qi Qingqi said: “If this was poison from the human world, juniorapprentice brother Mu would be able to identify it with a glance. Since he is unable to, is this something you did?” Luo Binghe said indifferently: “I don’t like to use poison.” It’s true, Luo Binghe rarely uses poison to kill people. Moreover, he had no need to lie since he was currently in an overwhelmingly superior position. This meant that while the two sides were gathered in the hall, bickering with each other, some unknown person or persons had secretly sneaked inside past all of their defenses, and stolen Shen Qingqi’s corpse right from under the noses of the leaders of the human cultivators and demons. What a scary thought! Shen Qingqiu wondered: What’s up with people trying to steal his corpse? How come when he was alive no one wanted him but when he was dead he was in high demand 201 ? Luo Binghe saw that it would do no good to stay here and talk about it. Frowning, he said: “Never mind, no matter who took it, I will always be able to find it.” Black qi rose up in the air when Luo Binghe drew the Heart Devil sword. A slash of his sword cleaved space and a portal opened. Shen Qingqiu reminded him: “Remove the encirclement.” Luo Binghe looked at him then said brusquely: “As Shizun wishes.” The tip of Liu Qingge’s sword Cheng Luan was pointed down. Liu Qingge looked up and his hand clenched so tightly on the sword’s hilt that his palm 202 was cut and blood dripped down the blade. He stood there frozen for a long time but could only spit out a single phrase: “Just wait!” This word was thrown out like an icy dart yet full of fury and an overpowering desire to fight. Luo Binghe sheathed the Heart Devil sword and smiled grimly: “Go ahead!”"
"洛冰河何其敏锐。 他又往前走了一步。 “ 师尊以为 , 我会对你做什么？ ” 沈清秋真心实意地说： “ 我猜不出来。 ” 他再也不敢随便乱猜男主的心思了。事实证明 , 每次都错的十万八千里！ 洛冰河伸出右手，沈清秋不动声色 , 视线却忍不住粘在他指尖 , 随之一路探来。 那只手修长素净，不像是属于已经取过无数性命的魔头 , 更像是一只生来就该拨动琴弦的 手。虚虚滑过他脸颊，若有若无擦过皮肤。 然后落在他喉咙上。 不知是不是错觉 , 这只手正好按在沈清秋颈项间一条重要的血脉上。 沈清秋直视前方，喉结微不可查地动了动。 洛冰河却撤回了手。 “ 我的血。 ” 他说话时 , 看不出喜怒哀乐： “ 不受召唤了。 ” 原来他刚才皮肤相触，是在探查沈清秋体内已被压制的天魔之血。 洛冰河道： “ 看来这短短几天里，师尊另有奇遇。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 你要怎么办？再给我喝一次？ ” 洛冰河道： “ 喝了也跑 , 不喝也跑，左右都是一样，还是不要再让师尊心里对我多一层厌恶 了。 ” 在旁人面前，他一点面子都不留给沈清秋，私下独处时，却忽然客气斯文起来，沈清秋也 真是醉了。越是这样，越发不能掉以轻心。 “ 师尊就请暂时留在这里。如果愿意，地宫内可以随意走动。 ” 洛冰河说： “ 外面我留了人 手，他们不会进屋，如果有任何需要，传唤即可。 ” 沈清秋说： “ 很周到。 ” 洛冰河凝视他片刻，道： “ 有什么想要的。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 什么都行？ ” 洛冰河点头。 沈清秋就直说了： “ 我想尽量少见到你。不见是最好。 ” 洛冰河像是完全没料到沈清秋会说出这句话，脸白了白。 沈清秋见状，痛快是痛快了，可也好像被一根针扎了一下。毕竟，他过往从来不对人说话 这么尖刻不留情。 血色涌回洛冰河脸上的过程极其缓慢，他说： “ 师尊曾问过我，想不想变强。 ” 沈清秋说： “ 我问这句话的时候，好像也告诉过你，变强是为了守护，而不是掠夺杀戮。 ” 洛冰河漠然道： “ 不。成为最强者，才能把想要的人牢牢攥在手心。我终于知道，等着师 尊你过来，是不行的。 ” 他握了握拳，勉强扯出一个凶狠的笑容。 “ 所以，这次抓到，就别想再跑了！ ” 混世魔王退场之后，沈清秋敲了敲系统： “2.0 ，在不？ ” 系统：【 24 小时为您提供全方位、人性化的在线服务。】 沈清秋： “

系统：【情景小推手豪华套装版。】 沈清秋果断地叉掉了升级下载框。 艹，已经下载完了，爽度还他妈扣了 3000 ！！！他要给差评！！！ 蛋疼地给系统发了一堆投诉和垃圾信息，沈清秋开始了他的软禁生活。 洛冰河忙着联合漠北君领土上的北疆魔族，纱华铃似乎也正式开始了坑爹大业  字面意 义上的。总之，近期洛冰河要抹杀和要拉拢的对象很多，恐怕事务繁杂，无法抽身，所以 一直没有出现。 或者是那天被沈清秋说了一句重话，玻璃心碎了一地，不敢出现。 无论是哪种，沈清秋都谢天谢地。 如果洛冰河一直这样不来找他，这种生活，不就是他一直追求的混吃等死颐养天年的日子 吗？ , 而且洛冰河也没有用锁链之类的东西锁住他。 狗屁！ 沈清秋会这么自我安慰的话，就是脑子进翔了。他又不是斯德哥尔摩综合征患者，稍微养 得肥一点就感恩戴德。幸福生活要靠自己创造不能靠别人施舍懂不懂？！ 沈清秋手上一使劲儿，书页嗤啦裂了，而窗外传来更响亮的裂竹声。他打起帘子，见是一 堆魔族小厮在忙活，探头问： “ 你们在干什么？ ” “ 沈仙师，你怎么出来啦？ ” 那小厮态度十分热情又恭敬，倒不像是在对一个被软禁的人说话。他笑道： “ 这边在种竹 子。 ” 沈清秋一怔： “ 竹子？ ” “ 嗯。您该知道这种人界的植物。它在魔界这儿不好种，长不成，可君上一定要种在这里 ，大家就只好想办法啦。 ” 沈清秋观察他力量和运劲方式，绝对不是个普通杂役。洛冰河找来的这些魔族恐怕都是从 黑铠武将里挑的。让这些高手给他来打杂，真是暴殄天物。 这还不止。 头两天沈清秋没心思没胃口，而第三天他就失去食欲不振的兴趣了，同肤白貌美胸部大的 魔族 mm 侍女矜持地沟（ da ）通（ shan ）几句，叫了顿饭。 没动两筷子，他就吃不下去了。 那名侍女歪头，笑嘻嘻地问道： “ 怎么啦沈仙师，味道不好么？ ” 味道很好，非常好。就是因为太好了，好的极其熟悉，沈清秋很多年没尝到过了，这才吃 不下去了。 他放下筷子： “ 是姑娘做的？ ” 那侍女咯咯笑道： “ 怎么可能呀，我只会杀，只会生吃，或者等肉腐了再吃，不会这种人 界的做法，又是火又是一堆柴米油盐的，麻烦死了。 ” …… 靠，原来是腐食爱好者，沈清秋更吃不下了。 沈清秋早看出来，这姑娘每天擦桌扫地，太委屈她了。沈清秋认为，她的画风和实力更适 合抡着一对板斧上阵杀敌如砍瓜切菜。很有可能她原本就是这个岗位上的。 沈清秋闷声不动色： “ 那是谁做的？ ” 那侍女道： “ 啊唷，这个我可不敢说。说了君上要杀了我的。 ” 不说？不说他就尝不出来了？ 沈清秋翻个白眼，说不清是气闷还是烦躁。 洛冰河真是 …… 烦死了！ 你以为他黑得彻底了，一会儿他又来可怜巴巴讨好示弱；你以为他是一朵楚楚可怜的小白 花，他过会儿马上啪啪来打你脸；当面凶神恶煞拽狠狂霸，背地又暗搓搓搞些小动作。 sjb 啊！他真的活脱脱是个 sjb ！ 那侍女撤去饭菜，一扭一扭离开。她出去后没多久，帘子一挑，摇摇晃晃走进来个人。 沈清秋一看清那张脸，恶向胆边生，抄了一记暴击迎上去： “ 向天打飞机我操【你 ” 尚清华连忙举手一格，一把未出鞘的剑往中间一横，化去攻势。他说： “ 哎哎哎，别，千 万别。沈大大，你现在可不能随便操人。你要是操了我，我固然没啥好下场，你也别想那 位能让你好过。 ” 沈清秋咆哮： “ 你居然卖我！友谊呢？！同乡之情呢？！ ” 尚清华说： “ 不卖能怎么办。那可是洛，我就算不卖你，他差不多也猜出来了。我为 什么要平白多挨打挨揍，又不是傻逼，我选择坦白从宽。 ” 他说得太理直气壮不要脸，沈清秋为之震惊，一不留神，尚清华已经跨步提摆，在桌子旁 坐下了，他把手中长剑 “ 啪 ” 的往桌子上一放： “ 别说这个啦。我是奉命来送东西的。 ” 沈清秋定睛再看，手已经先抚了上去。 是他那把自爆时随着溃散的灵力被震断为数截的佩剑。修雅剑。 沈清秋对它还是很有感情的，故剑入手，当即再顾不上殴打尚清华。抽出剑身，依旧清白 雪亮，修长纤雅，锻接得天衣无缝，灵气盎然，不见一丝裂痕。 那头，尚清华呼呼嘿嘿地搓手，啧啧叹道： “ 哎呀，我真是 …… 怎么也想不到 …… 剧情会 歪成这个样子。 ” 沈清秋： “ 你写的种马文男主变成了一个基佬，你难道不应该愤怒吗？ ” 尚清华真诚地说： “ 无所谓啊。反正看上的不是我。 ” 沈清秋对他比了个亲切的中指，低头擦剑。尚清华竖起大拇指： “ 其实也不必这么悲观 嘛。你挺有前途的，挺有前途。这金大腿，粗壮，牢靠！ ” 沈清秋说： “ 去尼玛的金大腿。好歹那也得是大腿，老子这抱到什么地方去了？！大腿中 间！ ” 尚清华： “ 大腿中间更好啊。大腿中间可是男人的关键部位。 ” 要不是修雅剑刚回到手里，舍不得拿来做龌龊的事，沈清秋真有心把他大腿中间的部位削 下来一坨。他想起要紧的事，脸色一正，问道： “ 既然坦白从宽，那我问你，天琅君这个 人物，你有没有做过什么设定？ ” 尚清华： “ 你问冰哥他爹干什么？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 不干什么，就是觉得奇怪，男主他爹你居然不大做文章。要知道多个老婆你 都能写 50 万字，多个爹你肯定还能再连载两年。 ” 尚清华精神一振： “ 你真有眼光，果然是我的忠实读者。我跟你说啊，我原来呢，是打算 展开大框架写的，设定是冰哥他爹是 boss ，结果写着写着，电脑崩了一回，大纲丢了，很 多细节都不清楚了。 ” …… 沈清秋总算知道他那么多坑是怎么来的了： “ 所以干脆就这么坑坑洼洼了？ ” 尚清华说： “ 其实坑坑洼洼也没什么对吧，主要是大家看的爽了就行。妹子该推的都推了 ，贱人该杀的都杀了，也没必要非要再安排个 boss 。 ” 向天打飞机砍大纲是砍得爽了，可系统则把严谨负责地这个世界的坑都补全了！ 尚清华继续道： “ 其实还有更重要的原因。主要是我也不知道该怎么编了。天琅君血比他 儿子纯，武力比他儿子高，成名比他儿子早，人设比他儿子叼，我想了半天，居然想不出 来该让男主怎么打败他！ ” 沈清秋扶额。 哦草。 这要是天琅君真的被放出来了，洛冰河究竟能不能打败他？！ 说不定，利用这个可以牵制住洛冰河？ 沈清秋立马掐灭了这个危险的想法。 对于根本不知道有几斤几两的对象，妄想利用，说不定最后怎么死的都不知道。 结论还是万年不变的：向天打飞机菊苣真是太能让人省心了！ 沈清秋拍桌： “ 你老实交代，你还有什么设定过但没写出来的东西没有。捡要紧的说！ ” 尚清华： “ 要不要紧我不知道，不过有一个是跟你、准确来说是跟沈九有关的。 ” 沈清秋一听，寒毛都竖起来了。 依向天打飞机的尿性，会给他加什么画风正常的设定才怪！ 沈清秋抱头道： “ 你 …… 你说吧。我能扛得住。 ” 尚清华开始慷慨激昂地谈他的写作理念： “ 沈清秋这个人物我有很多想法。我希望能把他 塑造成一个圆形的立体人物，他人渣，他猥琐，但他也有渣的原因和不渣的一面。不过读 者不太买账，我一开始写那个苗头，他们就在书评区掐了，所以我一看风向不对，立刻把 他改成了一个脸谱化的猥琐贱人。但其实他 ……” 沈清秋正聚精会神，忽然，屋外几名侍女齐齐恭声道： “ 君上！ ” 来得太不是时候了！ 这一声传进来，尚清华脸色大变，火舌燎了屁股一般一蹦三尺高，冲向后门： “ 你那位来 了，今后再说！ ” 别走啊！沈清秋伸出尔康手。 去你的 “ 今后再说 ” ！卡在这种地方比【目击证人说 “ 凶手其实是 ……” 然后吐出一口血就地 身亡】还不能忍！！！ 沈清秋回转身体的时候，青帘一挑，洛冰河正低头走进屋来。 他立即换上一副波澜不惊的面孔。 因为被打断了非常重要（大概）的严肃座谈，脸色也不好。洛冰河目光先是在他手中修雅 剑上一点，这才移了上去。 沉默片刻，还是洛冰河率先开的口。 “ 这些天过得如何。 ” “ 挺好。 ” 没见到他，的确挺好。 洛冰河道： “ 师尊似乎一直不曾休息。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 若是能不做梦，休息也是好的。 ” 他这话意思非常清楚。洛冰河居然也没生气。 他眼睫轻垂，站了一会儿，像是下了很大决心，才低声道： “ 虽然梦境中那时对师尊有所 隐瞒，可我当时所说的话，却不是假的。 ” 你丫真敢说！ 一提到这个，沈清秋就火大，恨不得抡起胳膊抽他百十个大耳刮子。 梦里的洛冰河当真是可爱多了，虽然男主还是那个男主，但凄凄楚楚柔肠百转的，纵使直 男如沈清秋，也忍不住心生怜惜。只是当时越怜惜，事后脸就被抽的越疼。栽了个跟斗丢 了个大脸，怨不得他恼羞成怒。 沈清秋道： “ 我现在是真不知道你哪句话真，哪句话假了。 ” 他还说过金兰城之事不是他做的，沈清秋原先都有九成信了，现在却一成都不敢信了。 洛冰河血气上涌，脸色微红，抬起眼睑，冷冷地说： “ 师尊只顾生气我骗了你，可如果我 不这么做，恐怕现在我还不能和你说上一句话。 ” 那是，沈清秋一向都是见到他转身就跑的。即便是说上话了，不知道为什么，也像现在这 样，三句两句就僵持住了，火药味十足。 洛冰河手指无意识把心魔剑的剑柄越扣越紧，指节用力到发白。不止瞳孔发红，眼眶也在 隐隐发红： “ 师尊又何尝没骗我？你说不赞同魔族人界之分，可转眼就不承认。花月城身 死，五年里我招魂上万次，屡试屡败，屡败屡试，从未心灰意冷，即便如此，我也从没怀 疑过师尊厌弃我到了这种程度，宁可弃身也不想看到我。 ” 他说到最后，尾音有些不稳，声调也渐渐扬起，又似激愤又似赌气： “ 师尊现在当然大有 理由指责我是混世魔王，我为祸苍生。可为什么我什么都没做的时候，也要被避如蛇蝎？ 你骗我两次，我也骗你两次，不是公平得很？ ” …… 他这算的也太清楚了！ 一桩还一桩，果然是有仇必报的类型！ 纵使觉得他算得没错，沈清秋仍忍不住由衷地说： “ 你真记仇。 ” 洛冰河嗤笑， “ 师尊恐怕是没看过我真正记仇的样子。 ” 他笑着笑着，神情渐转阴郁，淡淡地道： “ 如果我说，对师尊，我只记，不仇。也多半不 会被相信吧。 ” 沈清秋暗暗心惊： “ 你冷静。 ” 要说话就好好说，不要变脸！ 洛冰河沉声说： “ 师尊你向来都能冷静，可我冷静不下去了。 ” 沈清秋还没反应过来怎么回事，只听咕咚一声，后背一痛。再缓过神来，两人已经双双滚 到了床板上。 …… 好久没睡这竹床板了真他妈硌得慌！ 沈清秋骂人了： “ 反了你了？！ ” 洛冰河抿嘴不说话，沈清秋正想一脚踹开他，突然炸开了毛。 一只手倏地从下摆探进了他内衫。 我屮！ 沈清秋膝盖猛地往上一顶，被洛冰河单手握住膝盖，就势一压。 沈清秋心里狂艹一百遍，他可不想被掰成两腿大张躺在别人身下的姿势！当即上身冲起， 用了段巧劲，腰部一转，一个斗转星移大翻身，把洛冰河反压在身下。 修雅出鞘三寸，寒澄澄抵上洛冰河喉间，沈清秋也被激上了火气，狞笑道： “ 玩儿霸王硬 上弓？嗯？ ” 受制于人是实话，可也别想他摆出乖乖就范的姿态！ 洛冰河上下三路加颈上命门都被制住，却目光炫亮，分毫不畏惧颈间利刃，一把握住沈清 秋手腕，另一手在地上一撑，形势即将再次倒转，沈清秋哪能让他如意，修雅剑剑柄刺他 穴位，你来我往几个回合，打作一团骨碌碌滚下床去，沈清秋突然反应过来。 不对，这可是修真文，肉搏个屁！有炮不用，傻逼吗！？ 他立刻扬手，掼了一把灵力，石破天惊的一拳捣上洛冰河小腹。 这一拳打得痛快极了，沈清秋接连数日的憋屈恼火都仿佛跟着砸了出来，正爽破天际，突 然系统滴滴叭叭地撒花提示： 【* ★ ,°*:. ☆ (￣ ￣ )/$:*.° ★ * 。恭喜 ~ 爽度 +500 ！】 沈清秋： “……” 我靠，这人真的变态！他真的是！当之无愧的受虐狂！不虐不爽！打他一拳居然能有 500 爽！连系统提示都变得花里胡哨春心荡漾还破天荒带了个飘号，活了多少年也没见到这样 的奇葩！ 沈清秋还待再砸一记暴击，洛冰河却不陪他玩儿了，右手一拨，沈清秋失了准头，暴击打 偏，屋顶轰的砸出一个形状规则的坑。可沈清秋这一下是连环的，一记打偏，第二第三波 灵力接踵而至。洛冰河只拨开，不还击，偶尔被打中，生生受住，哼都不哼一声，一路翻 滚，所到之处白光火花四处爆炸，灵气魔气混混沌沌，暴击乱飞。 装b 装太久，沈清秋不知多久没这样粗鲁地暴打一场了。怎一个解气了得！冷不防一只手 撕开内衫，肉贴肉摸上了他腰身。 沈清秋当场软了一刹那，立即哐的一剑柄甩上洛冰河脑门，骂道： “ 畜生！ ” 这种时候还能干这种事，不是畜生是什么？！ 暴打了他一顿，系统提示五十多条，爽度起码加了 4000 多！ 洛冰河自暴自弃道： “ 反正师尊眼里我就是畜生不如，还不如坐实了。 ” 沈清秋气得想笑，找虐是吧？包你爽！一个 “ 滚！ ” 字并双手联合大暴击还没迸发出去，突 然眼前一花，身体歪了歪。 修雅剑摔落在地。一种魂魄整个都快被抽出体外的拖力袭来。 他只僵住了身子，洛冰河就停了动作，惊疑不定，警惕非常。瞬息之间，沈清秋已经头疼 得快炸开了。 眼前飞快地闪过无数画面碎片，有时候空白一片，有时候漆黑一团，有时好像看到影影绰 绰的人形。尖锐的耳鸣刺得耳膜生疼。 洛冰河这才感觉大不对劲，翻身坐起，伸手去按他。沈清秋居然没被他按住，仿佛有一双 巨手在往外粗鲁地拽他的灵魂和脑子，沈清秋抱着头在地上翻滚挣扎起来。 有东西在叫，从四面八方伸出手一边嘶叫一边撕扯他的魂魄。 即便是天魔之血被催动得最凶猛的时候，沈清秋也没有这样想惨叫的冲动。 洛冰河慌道： “ 师尊，我 …… 我刚才只是吓吓你。你别当真。你怎么了？ ” 沈清秋身躯在他臂弯中腾挪翻转，洛冰河半抱着他，飞快地用灵流在沈清秋体内过了一道 ，明明没有异常，可沈清秋叫声说不出的凄厉可怖，像是被烧红的铁烙直接探入脑子里。 随着沈清秋的心跳脉搏越来越弱，洛冰河开始发抖，先是轻微的战栗，而后越来越厉害， 撑不住身体，由半跪跌成了双膝跪地。 他用尽了一切办法，还是不见起色，只能吼道： “ 来人！都滚进来！ ”","CHAPTER 55: LIFE UNDER HOUSE ARREST Linking the rift between the two realms was a wide stone corridor. Pairs of torches marched endlessly into the distance, and the depths were as dark as a dense forest at night. Looking at the style of murals to the sides of the corridor, there was a strong yin ambiance, and it was clear to see this was Luo Binghe’s headquarters in the Demon Realm. After the breach sealed, Luo Binghe didn’t continue to restrain Shen Qingqiu, slowly releasing his hands. Shen Qingqiu stood up straight and dusted off his sleeves, not saying a word. The two both had nothing to say, not giving each other a sideways glance. One in front and one behind, their footsteps made no breath of sound. The atmosphere was stiff and cold. The forks in the corridor of the underground palace did not make Luo Binghe slow by a hairsbreadth. After strolling a twisted path through the complex for some time, the scene suddenly opened up before their eyes. Architecture in the Demon Realm was mostly entrenched underground in excavated subterranean caves, not seeing sun or moon throughout the year, but this part pierced through the ground at the top, allowing sunlight to shoot in and add more than a little bit of human character. Pushing open the door and entering, the furnishings and arrangement of the room were quite familiar-looking. In fact, it was quite similar to the bamboo house on Qing Jing Peak. Shen Qingqiu felt a mysterious sense of resentment. He really wanted to ask Luo Binghe, “What is the meaning of this?” Arranging up the scene and props like we’re on a theater set, rounding up the players, pretending like nothing ever happened ━ do you want to continue that daily little play of a loving master and disciple relationship from your dreamscape? Now acting like a miserable child and throwing tantrums, making his heart overflow with sympathy. Now again hitting his face and telling him it was all an act. Real or fake, his eyes weren’t sharp enough to clearly see autumn feathers 203 and see through Luo Binghe’s heart to understand what he was really thinking, some parts truth and some parts hypocrisy. While he was still brooding over these thoughts, Luo Binghe walked a step closer to him. If it were a few days earlier, Shen Qingqiu definitely wouldn’t havehesitated to flee, retreating three steps for every one step closer. But now, he obviously didn’t want to make this kind of move. That would look too much like he was a woman from a good family kidnapped by bandits, way too unnatural. Even as a dragon swimming shallow waters or a tiger dropped into the plains 204 , he could still scrounge up his last drop of courage to maintain graceful and prudent affectation. By no means would he sink to a thoroughly unsightly appearance. But he was still inevitably tense, his heart stretched taut as a bowstring, his eyelids jumping and fingertips curled. How was Luo Binghe so perceptive? He advanced another step. “Shizun, what do you think I’m going to do to you?” Shen Qingqiu said sincerely, “I cannot guess.” He would never again dare to wantonly guess Luo Binghe’s intentions. The facts were clear, each time he was light-years off the mark! Luo Binghe reached out his right hand. Shen Qingqiu didn’t make a sound or movement, but his gaze couldn’t help but stick to his fingertips, following them as they reached out. That hand was neat and slender. It didn’t look like the hand of a Demon Race young master who had already taken countless lives, but rather one which was born to pluck strings, a hand to burn incense and bathe in snow. It slid shyly over his cheek, faintly brushing his skin. And then it landed on his throat. He didn’t know whether or not it was on accident, but this hand had landed exactly on one of the major arteries of his neck. Shen Qingqiu’s throat bobbed imperceptibly. Luo Binghe retracted his hand. The next time he opened his mouth, it was impossible to tell if he was happy, angry, sorrowful, or joyful. “My blood, it’s not responding to my beckoning.” So when he had touched his skin just now, it was to probe the suppressed Heavenly Demon’s blood in Shen Qingqiu’s body. Luo Binghe said, “It looks like in these short few days, Shizun has had another fortuitous meeting.” Shen Qingqiu said, “Well, what can you do about it? Make me drink it again?” Luo Binghe said, “You’ll run if you drink it, you’ll run if you don’t, both options are the same. I had better not make Shizun add another layer of loathing for me in his heart.”In front of others, he had left not a bit of face for Shen Qingqiu, but in private, he suddenly became polite and courteous. Shen Qingqiu felt a bit conflicted. “Shizun, please stay here for the time being. If you would like, the inside of the underground palace is free for you to wander.” Luo Binghe continued, “I have left servants outside, they will not enter the room. If you need anything, simply send a summons.” Shen Qingqiu said, “How thoughtful.” Luo Binghe fixed his gaze on him for a time, then said, “Is there anything you desire?” Shen Qingqiu said, “Anything is acceptable?” Luo Binghe nodded. A sudden malicious sentiment arising from his gut, Shen Qingqiu bluntly said, “I want to see you as little as possible. Best if I never see you at all.” Luo Binghe looked like he never expected Shen Qingqiu to make this sort of request, his face paling. Seeing this, Shen Qingqiu felt a flash of schadenfreude but also felt like he had been pricked by a needle, maybe because he had never said anything so vitriolic and merciless to anyone in the past. The blood slowly returned to Luo Binghe’s face. He said, “Shizun once asked me if I wanted to become strong.” Shen Qingqiu said, “That time I asked you that question, I seem to remember I also told you that the purpose of becoming strong is protecting people, not plundering and slaughtering them.” Luo Binghe said coldly, “No. You had it wrong. What Shizun taught, not necessarily every point was correct. Only after becoming the strongest can one keep the people they want to have securely in their palms. I finally understand ━ it wouldn’t do to wait for Shizun to come over himself.” He clenched his fist, forcefully ripping a vicious smile onto his face. “So, now that I’ve captured you this time, Shizun had better not think of escaping ever again!” After the devil incarnate had exited the scene, Shen Qingqiu knocked on the System. “2.0, are you there?” The System responded:The System provides comprehensive 24-hour support and lifelike online support. Shen Qingqiu said, “Uh, comprehensive is enough, forget about the lifelike. What are my current point values?”The System: B points 1330, Proud Immortal Demon Way successfully removed “Landmines Raining Down Like Lightning” tag, reached “Rather Many Tsukkomi Points” stage, encouraging you to continue connecting and striving, looking forward to your next mystery achievement unlock. Coolness points 3840, Anger points 1500, Heartbreak points 4500. Great effort still needed to improve. Very good. Through his great effort (looking for death), this rotten stallion novel finally saw some improvement in B points. Though “Rather Many Tsukkomi Points” wasn’t any favorable evaluation, it was certainly a few points stronger than “Landmines Raining Down Like Lightning.” The anger points weren’t as heaven-defying as he had thought, but instead, the heartbreak points were high enough that he felt he had been pricked by another needle. Diverting his gaze, Shen Qingqiu said, “With this many coolness points, can I exchange them for something?” The System: You can exchange for a System feature upgrade. Shen Qingqiu said cheerfully, “Okay. Do the upgrade.” With a ringing notification sound, the System quietly began to download the upgrade package. Shen Qingqiu had a sudden thought and asked, “Right, what is the name of this feature upgrade?” The System: Small Scenario Pusher Luxury Edition. Shen Qingqiu decisively jabbed at the cancel button on the download window. Fuck, it’s already done downloading, and it took fucking 3000 coolness points. Zero-star rating! Aggrievedly spamming the System with a pile of complaints, Shen Qingqiu started his life under house arrest. Luo Binghe was busy uniting the Northern Border tribes on Mobei-Jun’s territory and Sha Hualing seemed to be officially starting her great cheating undertaking ━ in the literal sense. In short, in the near future, Luo Binghe had many targets to obliterate or rope in. With many official duties to attend to, perhaps unable to extricate himself, all along he had not shown his face. Or maybe that day, his glass heart had been shattered by Shen Qingqiu’s harsh words, and he didn’t dare to appear. Shen Qingqiu tore his thoughts away from that latter path with great difficulty. In short, if Luo Binghe continues to leave him alone, this sort of lifestyle,isn’t it his long-awaited goal of days spent “muddling around, eating food, awaiting death, and enjoying one’s later years?” Furthermore, Luo Binghe didn’t act like the characters in the books his younger sister liked to read in his previous life and shackle him with chains, blindfolded and gagged, stripped and beaten. He might as well be content with whatever he has and make himself at home wherever he is. Bullshit! For Shen Qingqiu to attempt to comfort himself with these words, there must be shit in his brains! He wasn’t some sort of Stockholm syndrome patient, feeling deep gratitude for being fattened in captivity. Don’t you understand, you need to bring about a fortunate lifestyle yourself, not by relying on others’ charity? Having defeated his own brainwashing, Shen Qingqiu exerted his strength, a page from a book splitting open in his hands. At the same time, a loud sound of bamboo cracking resounded from outside the window. He lifted the curtain, seeing a group of young Demon Realm servants hurrying about. Poking his head outside, he asked, “What are you doing?” “Master Shen, why did you come out?” The servant had an extremely enthusiastic and deferential attitude, completely unlike someone speaking to a person under house arrest. He smiled and said, “We’re planting bamboo over here.” Shen Qingqiu stared. “Bamboo?” “En. You should recognize this Human Realm plant. It’s hard to plant here in the Demon Realm and won’t mature properly, but Junshang is determined to get it planted here, so everyone just has to figure out a way.” Seeing his strength and the way he moved, Shen Qingqiu knew this definitely was not an ordinary manual laborer. He was afraid that all the demons Luo Binghe had found were all the cream of the crop. To make these experts do odd jobs for him ━ what a waste of resources! And that wasn’t the end of it. For the first two days, Shen Qingqiu had been apathetic and had no appetite, but on the third day he abandoned his interest in fasting and said a few aloof words to (flirted with) the pale-skinned and busty pretty maid, calling for a meal to be delivered. Before he even picked up his chopsticks twice, he didn’t have the stomach to continue. The maid tilted her head, asking in a laughing voice, “What is it, Master Shen, is the flavor not good?” The taste is good, very good. It’s just that it’s too good, a very familiargood taste, it’s been many years since Shen Qingqiu had tasted this, and that’s why he could not continue. He put down his chopsticks and probed, “Was it you who made this?” The maid chuckled, “How could that be? I only know how to kill and eat fresh or wait for the meat to rot before eating. I don’t know these human recipes, with all the fire and a ton of rice and condiments ━ it would trouble me to death.” Fuck, turns out this clear-voiced beautiful demon with breath like orchids was a rotten flesh lover. Shen Qingqiu had long been able to see, making this girl clean tables and sweep the floor every day was debasing her too much. Considering her strength, she was more suited to wielding a pair of broad axes into battle to cut up enemies rather than chopping melons and slicing vegetables, and it was very likely she used to have this exact job. Shen Qingqiu said with a suppressed tone and no change of expression, “Then who made it?” The maid said, “Aiyo, this I dare not say. Junshang would definitely kill me if I did.” Dare not say? Would he not be able to taste it if she just didn’t say? Shen Qingqiu wavered between putting down and picking up that pair of chopsticks. What was that saying? The hand that has received is hesitant, the mouth that been fed is soft 205 . Shen Qingqiu very much worried if, after finishing this meal, he could still forcefully take a righteous stance against Luo Binghe. But, in the end, the cook was too familiar with his taste and eating habits, and while he was worrying he had unconsciously cleaned his plate… The maid cleared the dishes and left with a swing of her hips, covering a smirk with her hand. Not long after she left, the curtain lifted and a person wobbled their way in. Seeing this face, a vicious feeling sprang from Shen Qingqiu’s gut. Meeting him with a violent strike, he yelled, “Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky, I” Shang Qinghua frantically raised his hands to block, a sword shooting out of its scabbard to slash across the space between them, taking an offensive stance. He said, “Ai ai ai, don’t, please don’t. Shen-dada, you really can’t fuck with people as you please. If you mess with me, admittedly I don’t have any impressive skills, but don’t think that this one will let you get off easy.” Shen Qingqiu roared, “You sold me out. What about fellowship? Camaraderie from having a common origin?” Shang Qinghua retorted, “What fellowship is there between us unless it was truly love disguised as hate all along? Ah, don’t treat me like this, that reallyhurts… what could I have done other than selling you out? It was Great God Luo, even if I didn’t sell you out he had pretty much figured you out already. Why would I look for a beating for no reason? This doesn’t mean anything, I just chose to confess and take the easy path.” This reply was so textbook shameless, Shen Qingqiu was a little astonished. After letting his guard down for a moment, Shang Qinghua had already stepped over and sat down beside the table. He set the sword in his hand on the table with a bang and said, “Let’s not talk about this anymore. I was ordered to deliver something to you.” Taking a better look at that sword, Shen Qingqiu’s hand already reached out to caress the blade. It was the very sword which had been shattered into many broken pieces by his destroyed spiritual energy when he had self-destructed. The unfortunate Xiu Ya Sword. Shen Qingqiu still had an emotional attachment to Xiu Ya, and as soon as he had the sword in hand, he had no more attention to devote to beating up Shang Qinghua. Drawing the blade from its sheath, it was as pure white and snow-bright as it had ever been, slender and elegant. Its broken pieces were reconnected as seamlessly as heavenly clothes, overflowing with spiritual energy, not a hairline split to be seen. On the other side, Shang Qinghua laughed nervously and rubbed his hands, clicking his tongue and saying, “Aiyah, I really, really never thought… the storyline would bend so far out of shape. Remarkable, really remarkable.” Shen Qingqiu: “The stallion novel protagonist you wrote turned into a cut- sleeve, shouldn’t you be angry?” Shang Qinghua said sincerely, “It doesn’t matter. Either way, the one he fell for wasn’t me.” Shen Qingqiu gave him a cordial middle finger, lowering his head to polish his sword. Shang Qinghua gave him a thumbs-up. “Really, you don’t need to be so pessimistic. You have good prospects for the future, quite good prospects. These golden thighs 206 , they’re strong, reliable!” Shen Qingqiu said, “Take your fucking golden thighs. If I have to hug those thighs, where do you think they’ll take me? Between the legs!” Shang Qinghua: “Between the legs is even better, ah. Between the legs is a man’s most important place.” If not for the fact that Xiu Ya had only just returned to his hands and he couldn’t bear to use it for filthy things, Shen Qingqiu really had a mind to sliceoff a chunk of that place between his legs. Not in the mood for this buffoonery, he straightened his expression and asked, “Since we’re being frank with each other, I’ll ask you: did you ever make any plans for Tianlang-Jun?” Shang Qinghua: “What are you going to do with information about Bing- ge’s dad?” Shen Qingqiu said, “It’s not that I want to do something with the information, I just thought it was strange how you didn’t make a fuss about the protagonist’s dad. I know for a fact that you can write a million words just to add a wife; you could definitely go on for three years to add a father.” Shang Qinghua started. “You really have some good eyes, truly a faithful reader of mine. I’ll tell you, originally, I planned on unfolding the framework of the plot to set Bing-ge’s dad as the BOSS, but as I was writing, my computer died and I lost my outline, and a ton of the details were lost. And at the time the reviews section all wanted a different plot line, the battle of Bing-ge invading a hundred flowers, you understand. A whole hundred sacred flower spirits who had never seen a man since birth, and he dealt with all of them. Cucumber bro, you know how much I suffered to write the hundred flower buds blooming in concert section, but you still roast me…” “…” At long last Shen Qingqiu knew the true origin of all those plot holes. “So you just went to write the harem plot line, and might as well leave the more serious Bing-ge’s dad plot line full of holes?” Shang Qinghua said, “Actually leaving it full of holes is no big deal. The main issue is making it cool for the readers. All the sisters who should have been pushed down were pushed down, all the cannon fodder that should have been killed were killed. Writing a plot line everyone might not be interested in is just spending extra effort for no reward. I just wanted to scrape up a living. If all the subscribers jump ship, I won’t have any food to eat, Cucumber bro.” Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky, you’re really having too much fun chopping down those outlines, but the System’s strict requirements are making me fill all the holes you dug with your malpractice! Shang Qinghua continued, “In fact, I wasn’t completely unwilling to part with it. In my original plans, TianLang-Jun had purer blood than Bing-ge, his martial power was stronger, he earned his fame earlier ━ his character was just more decked out than Bing-ge. Rising far above the filth of the ordinary world to laugh arrogantly over the Three Realms, and he even had a deeply moving tragic backstory to make one sing or cry, very Jack Sue 207 , right? What would I do if by any chance the readers think he’s stealing Bing-ge’s spotlight and start toprotest? You know Bing-ge has to be fierce in appearance, fierce in combat, and fierce in giving rewards.” Shen Qingqiu let his head drop to his hands. Hearing this confession from Boss Airplane, he was starting to worry. If TianLang-Jun really had been released, would Luo Binghe even be able to defeat him? But, looking at it from another angle, maybe it’s possible to curb the son by using the father? Shen Qingqiu immediately snuffed out that dangerous line of thought. Regarding a completely unknown opponent who could be righteous or nefarious, a vain attempt to use them might lead to you not even knowing how you’re going to die in the end. So, the conclusion still will never change in ten thousand years: Boss Airplane Flying Toward the Sky really is a genius, setting the standards of literature for the generation! Shen Qingqiu slapped the table. “You better be straight with me, list out everything you had planned but didn’t write when you changed the outline. The important things first!” Shang Qinghua stammered, “Important or not I don’t know, but there is a segment to do with you… or more precisely it has to do with Shen Jiu. Before I was always too ashamed to say…” Hearing this, the hair on the back of his neck stood up in anticipation. Knowing Airplane Flying Toward the Sky’s tendencies, it’d be a wonder if he had given him some normal backstory! Shen Qingqiu said, holding his head in his hands, “Just tell me. I can bear it.” Shang Qinghua started an impassioned explanation of his writing process. “I had a lot of ideas for this character Shen Qingqiu. I had hoped to mold him into a well rounded, three-dimensional character; he’s scum, he’s wretched, but he had reason to be scum and a not scummy side. But, the readers didn’t really buy into it, as soon as I started showing signs of this development they started griping in the reviews. So, I saw the winds weren’t blowing the right way and immediately turned him into a one-dimensional wretched villain. But really he…” Shen Qingqiu had turned his full attention to the explanation when suddenly, the maids outside the room chorused in a respectful tone, “Junshang.” This is really the worst time you could have come! Hearing this, Shang Qinghua’s expression transformed and he jumped a meter off the ground like his butt had been lit on fire. Rushing towards the back door, he shouted over his shoulder, “That man of yours is here. I’ll tell you later,no, in the future!” Don’t go! Shen Qingqiu stretched out an Erkang hand 208 . Take your “I’ll tell you in the future”! Cutting it off at this point is harder to bear than that mushy cliche scene of “witnessing with your own eyes someone on death’s door saying ‘my killer was… was…’ and then spitting out a mouthful of blood and dying”! The green curtain lifted, and Luo Binghe stooped to enter the room. Shen Qingqiu immediately put on an unruffled expression. Because his very important discussion had been cut off, he didn’t have a good look on his face. Luo Binghe’s gaze first alighted on Xiu Ya in his hand before shifting upwards. After a brief silence, it was Luo Binghe who took the initiative and opened his mouth. “These past few days, it seems that Shizun hasn’t taken a moment to rest.” Speaking of rest, Shen Qingqiu immediately thought of dreams; and speaking of dreams, he couldn’t help but remember all the embarrassing moves he made in the dream realm to console Luo Binghe. Shen Qingqiu rubbed his forehead and said, “If I could do it without dreaming, I’d be happy to rest.” Luo Binghe’s eyelashes drooped. After standing for a bit, it seemed he had come to a major decision. He said stiffly, “Even though those earlier events happened in a dream realm, I took advantage of Shizun. But the feelings I revealed to you then, those were not false.” Shen Qingqiu sighed and said truthfully, “Luo Binghe, right now I really don’t know which of your words are true and which are false. Therefore, don’t bother saying things like this.” The Luo Binghe in that dream was truly much cuter. Even though the male protagonist was still the male protagonist, he was wretched and miserable, making one’s guts twist a hundred times, and his face was not bad. Even a straight guy like Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but take pity on him. It’s just that the more pity he felt at the time, the more pain his face was in after the fact. Luo Binghe had said that the events in Jinlan City were not his doing, and at the time Shen Qingqiu believed him about nine-tenths of the way, but now he didn’t dare put in even a tenth of rash hope. The blood rushed back into Luo Binghe’s face, pinkening his cheeks. Lifting his eyelids, he said coldly, “Shizun is concerned only with my trickery, but if I hadn’t done so I’m afraid I still wouldn’t be able to speak a word to you.” His fingers unconsciously clenched tighter and tighter on Xin Mo’s hilt until his knuckles went white with the strain. Not only his pupils, but his eyesockets themselves began to glow faintly red. “Since when did Shizun never deceive me? You said you did not approve of attaching too much importance to the difference between races, but in the blink of an eye, you refuse to admit it. After your bodily death at Huayue City, I called for your soul hundreds of thousands of times, trying then failing then trying then failing again, never letting my heart fall to ash and my thoughts grow cold 209 . Despite this, I never suspected that Shizun would scorn me to this extent, looking at me with a detached gaze and madly playing dumb after returning to stand before my eyes.” At the end of his tirade, his final syllables were somewhat unsteady, the tones rising in both fury and exasperation. “Now Shizun certainly has abundant reason to denounce me as a devil incarnate, I bring disaster wherever I go. But this time I haven’t done anything at all, but you still scorn me like snakes and scorpions? You’ve tricked me twice, I’ve tricked you twice, aren’t we equal?” Even though he felt this “one is one, two is two” logic was not a fraction off the mark, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help revealing his true feelings. “You really hold your grudges.” Luo Binghe sneered, “I’m afraid Shizun has never seen what I’m like when I really hold a grudge against someone.” His face gradually settled into a gloomy expression from his sneer. Drawing closer the distance between the two, he said, “But what if I said, that towards Shizun, I only remember, not hate 210 , most likely I wouldn’t be believed.” Seeing the shadow his figure cast increasing in size, Shen Qingqiu hurriedly said, “Compose yourself.” If you want to talk then talk properly, don’t suddenly change your face, don’t get this close! Luo Binghe said in a low voice, “Shizun you could always compose yourself, but I can’t compose myself any longer.” Shen Qingqiu hadn’t fully processed this when with a clunk, his back began to hurt. The next thing he knew, the two of them had already rolled onto the bed. It’s been so long since I’ve slept on this bamboo bed, why is it so bumpy! Shen Qingqiu yelled, “What’s wrong with you!” Luo Binghe pursed his lips and refused to answer. Just as Shen Qingqiu thought to kick him away, goosebumps erupted over him from head to foot. A hand suddenly reached into his inner robe from the hem. You’ve got to be kidding me! He violently heaved up a knee, but Luo Binghe caught it with a singlehand, pressing it down to the side of his body. Shen Qingqiu internally yelled “fuck” a hundred times, he didn’t want to be forced into this position with his legs spread wide open, lying under another person! He immediately rushed up with his upper body, and with a well-timed burst of energy and a twist of his waist reversed their positions like a shift of the stars in the sky, pinning Luo Binghe under him. He unsheathed three inches of Xiu Ya, coldly pressing it against Luo Binghe’s throat. This was the first time in his life Shen Qingqiu had been pushed over by someone, and he had been pushed into a rage. With a violent grin, he sneered, “So you’re playing at forcing yourself upon your Shizun? En? How filial!” The accusations that had been turned upon him were true, but don’t think he would just quietly submit! Luo Binghe’s escape routes and the vital point of his neck had all been blocked off, but he had a dazzling light in his eyes. Not fearing the sharp blade at his neck in the slightest, he grabbed Shen Qingqiu’s wrist with one hand, the other propping himself up on the ground. With a vigorous attack, he reversed their positions again. Of course, Shen Qingqiu wouldn’t let him do as he wishes, jabbing towards a vulnerable point with Xiu Ya’s hilt. After a few such exchanges, the two were tangled in a lump. They rolled off the bed, turning the whole way, white flashes and sparks exploding every which way, spiritual energy and demonic energy mixing into a confused fog, violent attacks flying at random. After so long spent hiding behind a mask, Shen Qingqiu didn’t know how long it had been since he had fought in such a crude manner. After the battle had reached this level of intensity, Shen Qingqiu suddenly realized. That’s not right, this is a cultivation novel, why the fuck should I be fighting with my bare hands? What sort of dumbass has a cannon and doesn’t use it? He immediately raised his hand, pumping it full of spiritual energy, sending an earth-shattering punch towards Luo Binghe’s lower abdomen."
"沈清秋猝然睁开双眼。 漆黑一片。 他心脏狂跳不止 , 耳膜似乎也在跟着跳动。 为了看看到底是黑得伸手不见五指 , 还是自己瞎了，沈清秋真的伸出了五指。还没伸多远 , 指尖就碰到了坚硬的壁垒。沈清秋慢慢四下摸索起来。 摸了一阵，心里大概有了个底。他现在身处一个狭窄的空间内部 , 像是被放进了一个长方 的石匣子。 轻轻拍了拍石壁 , 冰冷 , 质地光滑细腻，目测是大理石一类。用灵力勘测一番，不算厚，应 该不超过四寸。 他摸了一阵，提气屏息 , 陡然发力，灵力震荡，轰的一掌拍在顶上的石盖正中央。 接连拍了三下，黑暗随着一声裂石巨响四分五裂。大量新鲜空气涌入，沈清秋猛地坐了起 来，用力吸了几口，才发现并不新鲜，像多年空气不流通的地气，而且十分稀薄。再低头 一看，他居然躺在一口棺材里。 这个长方状的石匣子，居然是一口雕饰精美、通体莹白如玉的石棺。 他在棺材边缘轻轻一按，跃了出来。 四下望望，他正站在一间光线黯淡的石室里，那口被轰飞石盖的棺材放在中央的供台上。 石室四角不规则堆放着蒙尘的物什，兵器、宝石、书简、瓶瓶罐罐，皆有，刀枪剑戟的寒 光与珠光宝气在一层厚尘之下，隐隐光色流转。 环顾一圈，墙壁上都是彩绘的群魔乱舞，重重包围在四面八方。 沈清秋一巴掌拍在脑门上。 错不了。这里绝逼是圣陵。 他还没消化这个信息，无意间低头，又被另一个信息击中了。 这个身体 …… 不是日月露华芝塑成的肉身。这是沈清秋的原装身体！ 圣陵有起死回生生之法，真的不是糊弄人的。看情形，多半是有人把沈清秋的尸身偷运入 圣陵内部，发动了招魂阵法。生生把他从新的躯体上拉了回来。 圣陵是魔族禁地，历代最高统治者们身后安居之所，没有达到这个高度的地位，入内者 死。而沈清秋进来时是个死人，而后魂魄附体，算是钻了个空子才有了一个观光游历的机 会。 洛冰河说他花了五年时间修复了这具身体的灵脉，居然是真的。沈清秋试了试，灵力运转 流畅完好。至于 “ 无可解 ” ，暂时没有滞涩感，不知道有没有被化去。 露华芝塑成的肉身一旦注入了魂魄，又被抽离，就会迅速枯萎坏死。洛冰河前一刻还在被 他暴打，现在恐怕要被他萎成渣渣的肉身吓个半死了吧。 勤勤恳恳的老农沈清秋种了那么多年的露华芝，就这么萎了。萎了！ 沈清秋正恨不得捶胸顿足，系统 “ 嘤咛 ” 发来消息： 【温馨提示：您现在已进入场景 “ 圣陵 ” 。 “ 填坑 ” 任务已发布。请踊跃出击，把握主动。】 沈清秋 “ 哦 ” 了一声，继续蹲着。 系统：【请踊跃出击，把握主动。】 沈清秋不动。系统：【警告：请踊跃 … 】 沈清秋： “ 知道了知道了！去去去！ ” 沈清秋蛋疼不已，朝墓室外走去。边走边回忆原著的圣陵副本。 魔界民居窝藏地底，陵墓却建在在地上，总之一切风俗都和人界反着来。陵墓中不但机关 重重，凶险非常，更有无数守陵的魔物，潜藏在暗处。 要不是系统魔音贯脑，沈清秋磕了药才跑出来在墓道里乱晃！ 墓道极黑，可沈清秋没有动用火诀。屏住呼吸，悄然无声朝前方走去。 不久，耳边浮起一丝绵长粗重的呼吸声。 说是呼吸，其实更像是垂死之人的叹息。 沈清秋定定站住。 这么快。来了。 黑暗之中，缓缓现出一个细瘦伶仃的影子。紧接着，第二个、第三个，跟在后面，游魂一 般慢吞吞飘了过来。 这些影子走一步，晃三晃，越走越近。沈清秋不动声色，侧开身子，把呼吸频率放到最 缓。 等级最低、遇见几率最大的守陵魔物之一，盲尸。 盲尸名字里有个 “ 盲 ” 字，实际上，该长的眼睛一只没少，反而要比别的怪物多长几双，挤 在脸上，恶心又猎奇。 不过眼睛虽多，却基本上没啥用。大多数时候，盲尸只是睁眼瞎，整天在圣陵里游荡巡逻 ，效率奇低。它们的眼睛又多又大，可退化的非常厉害。但对光线感知能力极强，哪怕是 一点微弱的反光，也能被迅速捕捉。 一旦被捕捉，它们会画风陡转，本能地对光源发出凶恶的攻击。到时候，可就是不在墓道 里慢悠悠排队走的这个速度了。 这样的怪物，单独拿出来，并不可怕，可怕的是，常常和它一起出现的一样东西。 沈清秋这么想着，一只盲尸歪歪扭扭靠了过来，他往旁边错开一部。 蓦地，黑暗之中，燃起一丝微弱的火光。这缕火苗是幽绿色的，越来越亮，把一条墓道照 成了绿油油的颜色。 那几只正要擦肩而过的盲尸突然转头，每一张脸上都起码镶嵌着三双血丝爆满的巨大眼球 ，直勾勾瞪着咫尺之遥的沈清秋。 妈的，真是哪壶不开提哪壶！ 沈清秋速度奇快，下一秒就闪到了墓道末端，可他闪到哪儿，哪儿就幽幽亮起一片绿光， 把他人影身形照得无所遁形。他快，受到光源刺激的盲尸更快！ 咽气烛！ 沈清秋击飞几只猛扑过来的盲尸， 此烛用生人之气和呼吸作为燃料，一旦有活人活物靠近，就会自发燃起。听起来像个可以 拿去坑蒙拐骗的小玩意儿，可当它和盲尸搭配使用的时候，效果简直毁天灭地的凶残！ 想想吧，如果圣陵里窜进了入侵者，走到哪儿，都要呼吸，他一呼吸，烛火就会亮起，扑 不灭，掐不完，整座圣陵里任何角落都有可能放置着咽气烛。成群结队的盲尸全扑了上 来。直到死，烛火才会渐渐暗下去。咽气咽气，咽气烛这名字取得真是好！ 比如现在，越来越多感光而至的盲尸已经把墓道塞满了！ 沈清秋奔出墓道，抢进一件墓室。这一间宽敞气派得多，中央高高供着一口棺材。他飞身 跃上，一掀，没掀动，再拍，响声沉沉，可照样纹丝不动，竟然比他刚才躺的那具石棺材 质坚硬得多。沈清秋心想，莫不是里面有人了？！他敲敲棺盖： “ 可借贵地暂且一避 否？！ ” 他本来只是脑抽，谁知道敲了两下，里面真的传一个声音。 那声音明明从棺材里发出，却清晰如在耳旁，一点儿也不闷，仿佛带着笑意： “ 请自便。 ” 卧槽！！！诈尸啊！！！ 沈清秋悚然。抬腿一扫，扫下了几只扑上石棺的盲尸。两步又翻下石棺，朝天顶打了一记 暴击。 碎石滚滚落下。沈清秋见打得松动，继续狂打。最好把天顶打塌了，他趁乱跑出去，把盲 尸和诈尸的全都埋在石块里！ 混战之中，忽然从墓殿外传来阴沉的嘶嘶之声。 沈清秋抬头一看，殿外仿佛点起了两个明黄的灯笼，好一对金刺刺的铜铃大眼，正对着这 边，中间一条竖直的瞳线，狰狞非凡。 那群盲尸听到这声音，仿佛受到无形的震慑，停止了撕咬扑缠，低头缩起肩膀，涌作一团 ，瑟瑟发抖。 那双大眼眨了两下，与沈清秋直直对视了一会儿，忽然消失不见。片刻之后，从殿外转进 一个人来。 沈清秋看清来人，并不意外，叫了声： “ 喜之郎。 ” 竹枝郎脚下一滑。 他摸了摸鼻子，虽然郁闷，仍不失礼，笑道： “ 沈仙师若愿意这么叫，也请随意吧。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 穹顶殿偷尸的，果真是你。 ” 浑身乌青的毒，多半是碧蛇的毒液。木清芳粗略看时找不到伤口，是因为蛇牙口细小，下 口难以被发觉。 竹枝郎道： “ 事发仓促，只得出此下策，还望沈仙师海涵。不敢触犯贵派门人，只让他们 小睡一段日子。 ” 沈清秋干咳一声， “ 事发仓促 ” ，指的肯定是他拿整个镇的雄黄酒熏竹枝郎，还把人家打回 原形骑了一路的事。 好在竹枝郎没杀苍穹山派的弟子，否则这事就没完了。沈清秋道： “ 你在圣陵把我召回， 也算是解决了我眼下一个 …… 困境。之前你要我到魔界来，现在我来了，究竟是什么目的 ，可以说了吗？ ” 竹枝郎道： “ 缘由之一，早已对沈仙师说明。滴水之恩，当涌泉相报。至于二，沈仙师并 非在下召回的 …… 还是直接询问君上的好。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 好。天琅君人呢？ ” 竹枝郎愣了愣，道： “ 我以为，沈仙师和君上已经打过照面了。 ” 打过照面？ 沈清秋低头看了看那口石棺。 难道 …… 里面那个诈尸的 …… 就是天琅君？！ 严格地来说，根本就没打 “ 照面 ” 好吧？！ 刚才他撬了半天也没撬开的棺盖震颤不止，缓缓自动滑开。从里面慢慢坐起一个人来。 这人一只手肘搭上棺沿，侧首微微一笑，道： “ 清静峰主，久仰啊。 ” 沈清秋震惊了。 …… 这一家人兴趣爱好虽然广泛，但也有异曲同工之妙，都是一般的画风清奇。儿子喜欢 抱尸体，爹喜欢躺棺材。天魔血系，就是不一样，服！ 洛冰河相貌肖似其母苏夕颜，可多少还是能在上面找到其父的影子。比如眼睛。 天琅君眼廓深邃，眉峰英挺，瞳孔黑如深潭，这点洛冰河就和他十分相似。若是洛冰河连 眼睛都像他娘，那相貌就阴柔过头，反而不好了。 再比如，笑容。这对父子的笑容，都让沈清秋有种难以形容的 …… 不妙感觉。 沈清秋谨慎地说： “ 我不做峰主很多年。 ”","CHAPTER 56: THE PERSON IN THE COFFIN Luo Binghe withstood it completely without making a single sound. “…” Honestly speaking, Shen Qingqiu didn’t think that he would actually hit him. But that didn’t stop him from punching him extremely hard as if he was slamming all the suppressed anger from these past few days with it. Suddenly, the System beeped and announced: ★ °:. ☆ \(  )/$:.° ★ Congratulations~ Cool points +500! Shen Qingqiu: “…” Luo Binghe truly… fully deserved to be called a masochist! If he wasn’t being abused, he wasn’t happy. Hitting him one time actually gave 500 cool points, and the System’s announcement even changed into flashy, youthful emoticons. It also used a tilde (~) for the first time ever. In all his years of living, he had never seen something so bizarre, especially since this bizarre thing was raised by him! Shen Qingqiu was just lamenting over the failed results of his teaching method when Luo Binghe stopped playing along with him. With a push of his right hand, Shen Qingqiu accidentally released a burst of spiritual energy that he was suppressing in his palm, and the ceiling shook as he smashed a uniformly shaped dent into it. The dust pattered down, and Luo Binghe covered him with his body, both of his hands grabbing onto Shen Qingqiu’s outer robe. He easily ripped it and laughed loudly. “Go ahead and hit me, in any case, I won’t die! This disciple will gladly endure Shizun’s teachings!” His smile seemed to conceal a trace of faint misery. Shen Qingqiu even forgot about his clothes being ripped as his heart twinged, and he couldn’t help but stop moving. But Luo Binghe didn’t give him any more time to consider tender affection; instead, he suddenly ripped apart Shen Qingqiu’s inner robe with one hand before he groped his waist, skin against skin. Shen Qingqiu melted for a moment on the spot, before he immediately knocked Luo Binghe on the head with the hilt of his sword. He scolded, “You animal!” Luo Binghe said with resignation, “In any case, I’m not even as good as an animal in Shizun’s eyes, so I might as well act like one.” Shen Qingqiu was so angry that he wanted to laugh, but his vision blurred abruptly, and his body tilted as the Xiu Ya sword clattered onto the ground. A kind of pulling force so strong that it felt as if his entire soul was about to be dragged out of his body attacked him. He could only stiffen his body, andLuo Binghe also stopped moving, somewhat bewildered. In the blink of an eye, Shen Qingqiu’s head was already hurting so much that it felt like it was about to explode. Countless fragments of scenes flashed swiftly before his eyes. Sometimes it was a white expanse of blank space, sometimes it was pitch black darkness, and sometimes he seemed to see indistinct human figures. There was a sharp ringing that painfully pierced his eardrums. Luo Binghe couldn’t afford to be wary any longer and hastily sat up before reaching out a hand to hold him down. Unexpectedly, he couldn’t restrain Shen Qingqiu. Shen Qingqiu hugged his head as he rolled around on the floor, struggling, feeling as if there was a pair of huge hands roughly dragging his soul and mind out of his body. There was something screaming, and as it shrieked, it felt like hands were reaching out at him from all directions, tearing at his soul. Luo Binghe said in a panic, “Shizun, I… I was only trying to scare you just then. Don’t take it seriously! What’s wrong?” Shen Qingqiu’s body thrashed and flipped around in his arms. Luo Binghe half-held him as he quickly used his spiritual energy to sweep through the inside of Shen Qingqiu’s body. There were clearly no abnormalities, but the sound of Shen Qingqiu’s screaming was indescribably mournful and terrifying, as if burning red brand had been shoved deep inside his brain. Luo Binghe used every method he knew, but still, nothing worked. As Shen Qingqiu’s pulse grew weaker and weaker, Luo Binghe started to shake slightly before his trembling grew stronger and stronger. Finally, he couldn’t prop himself up any longer, and he half-kneeled and half-fell onto his knees. He roared, “Everyone! Everyone get in here!” Shen Qingqiu suddenly opened his eyes. Everything was pitch-black. His heart was thumping wildly, and his eardrums seemed to be throbbing in time with it. In order to see whether or not it was just too dark, or whether he had gone blind, Shen Qingqiu really did reach out his hand. He hadn’t extended it fully yet before his fingers bumped into a solid barrier. Shen Qingqiu slowly started to fumble around. After feeling about for a while, he had a guess in mind. He was currently inside something narrow, as if he was placed inside a long stone box. He patted the stone wall lightly, and it was ice cold, the texture fine and smooth; heestimated that it was made of something like marble. The walls didn’t feel thick, and they should be about four inches wide, he found after using his spiritual energy to probe around. He fumbled around for a bit before he held his breath and suddenly used force. His spiritual energy spiked, and he slammed a palm with a bang against the middle of the stone lid. He hit it three times in a row before the darkness fell apart, along with the enormous sound of stone crumbling. Large amounts of fresh oxygen poured in, and Shen Qingqiu sat up abruptly, forcefully sucking in a few breaths. Only then did he discover that it wasn’t actually that fresh and felt more like the air hadn’t circulated underground for many years. Furthermore, it was extremely thin. When he lowered his head to take another look, he saw that he was actually lying inside of a coffin. This long, stone box was unexpectedly a delicately carved stone coffin, its entire body glistening white like jade. He pushed down lightly against the edge of the coffin and leaped out. When he looked around, he saw that he was currently standing in a weakly lit stone room. The coffin, which had its lid blown off, was lying on the altar in the middle of the room. Dusty objects were piled irregularly in the corners; there was everything from weapons and gems to scrolls, bottles, and jars. The cold light of swords and spears, along with the luster of gems and jewels, glimmered faintly beneath a layer of thick dust. After looking around in a circle, he saw that the walls were covered with paintings of demons dancing wildly, encircling him heavily in all directions. The demon race’s Holy Mausoleum. Shen Qingqiu arrived at this conclusion. He hadn’t digested this information yet when he unconsciously lowered his head and was hit by another piece of news. His body was no longer the corporeal body molded from the Sun and Moon Dew Flower Seed. This was Shen Qingqiu’s original body! The Holy Mausoleum had a way to call back those from the dead; this truly wasn’t something said to deceive others. Judging from the circumstances, it seemed like someone had smuggled Shen Qingqiu’s corpse into the Holy Mausoleum before activating the soul recall array. It had dragged him completely out of his new body and back into this one. The Holy Mausoleum was the demon race’s forbidden area, and it was also the place where the past supreme rulers rested peacefully after death. If onedidn’t reach this high of a position, they would die upon entering. But when Shen Qingqiu was sent in, he was a dead person, and his soul had repossessed his body afterward. He slipped in through a loophole, which gave him this chance to sightsee. Shen Qingqiu tested out his spiritual energy, and it flowed smoothly and easily. Luo Binghe said that he spent five years restoring this body’s meridian system, which had actually been the truth. As for the toxicity of “Without A Cure,” he didn’t feel like his spiritual energy was sluggish for the time being, but he didn’t know if the poison had been dissolved or not. Once a soul occupied and was removed from the corporeal body molded from the Dew Flower Seed, it would swiftly wither and necrotize. He didn’t know what kind of expression Luo Binghe had right now while facing that withered, wilted body of his… His train of thought didn’t wander very far before the System issued information with a ‘trill’: Please noteYou have now entered the high level instance “Holy Mausoleum.” The “Plot Hole Filling” mission has already been assigned. Please attack it eagerly and take initiative of your own accord. Shen Qingqiu made an ‘oh’ noise and continued to squat on the ground. The System: Please attack it eagerly and take initiative of your own accord. Shen Qingqiu didn’t move. The System: Warning: Please att… Shen Qingqiu: “I get it, I get it! I’m going!” Shen Qingqiu felt his balls hurt incessantly 211 as he walked outside of the tomb room. As he walked, he recalled the original version of the Holy Mausoleum. The houses in the Demon Realm were sheltered underground, but the Mausoleum was built above ground. In short, its customs were the complete opposite of the Human Realm’s. Not only were there many traps inside the Mausoleum, but it was also treacherous and full of countless demonic creatures that guarded the tombs, hidden in the darkness. If it weren’t for the System’s evil voice passing through his mind, he would have to be dragged before he would run out into the tomb passageway and wander around blindly! The tomb passageway was overwhelmingly dark, but Shen Qingqiu didn’t make a snap of fire. He held his breath and walked forward in absolute silence. Not long after, the sound of rough, prolonged breathing emerged next to his ear.It could be called breathing, but in reality, it was more like someone’s dying gasps. Shen Qingqiu stood firmly. Didn’t they come much too fast? A thin and weak figure slowly appeared from the darkness. It was closely followed by a second and third figure, floating closer very sluggishly like wandering souls. These figures swayed with each step they took, and they walked nearer and nearer. Shen Qingqiu’s expression didn’t change as he slanted his body and adjusted the frequency of his breathing to the absolute slowest it could go. This was the lowest-level demonic creature, and one of the guards most likely met in the Mausoleum: the Blind Corpse. The Blind Corpse’s name had the word “blind” in it, but it wasn’t actually lacking any eyes. In fact, it had several more pairs than other monsters, grotesquely squeezed onto its face. Those with trypophobia would definitely detest it. However, even though it had many eyes, they were essentially useless. Most of the time, the Blind Corpse’s eyes were pointless, and it roamed about the Holy Mausoleum patrolling all day, its efficiency unusually low. Its eyes were both numerous and large, but they degenerated to a terrible state. However, its ability to perceive light was very strong, and even if the light was merely a weak reflection, it could quickly seize it. Once it caught something, it would unexpectedly change and instinctively attack the origin of the light ferociously. When that time came, it no longer moved at this speed where it wandered slowly through the tomb passageways in a line. This kind of monster wasn’t scary on its own; what was scary was what often appeared with it. As Shen Qingqiu thought, a Blind Corpse stumbled closer, and he slipped to the side. Unexpectedly, a faint flame ignited in the darkness. This flame was dark green and grew brighter and brighter, illuminating the tomb passageway into a bright green. Those Blind Corpses, which were about to brush past him, all abruptly turned their heads. Each and every face was embedded with four or five pairs of enormous, bloodshot eyeballs as they stared straight at Shen Qingqiu, who was in close proximity. Last Breath Candle! Shen Qingqiu was extremely fast, and in the next second, he had flashed to the end of the passageway. But no matter where he dodged, a stretch of faint green light would ignite with him so that there was no way to hide his figure. Hewas fast, but the Blind Corpses that had been provoked by the light were even faster! Shen Qingqiu sent several Blind Corpses that had thrown themselves over flying. The Last Breath Candles used a living person’s breaths as fuel, and as long as something or someone alive went near it, it would light up by itself. It sounded like a toy that could be used to avoid the swindlers and cheaters that roamed about the streets, but when it was paired with the Blind Corpses, the results were simply unimaginably savage. Just imagine: if an intruder slipped inside the Holy Mausoleum, no matter where he went, he would still have to breathe. When he breathed, the Last Breath Candle would ignite, unable to be extinguished or pinched out. The Last Breath Candle array could be set up in any corner of the Holy Mausoleum. A large horde of Blind Corpses would all throw themselves over, and only when the intruder died would the candle flame gradually dim. Last breath, last breath, the Last Breath Candle was really a great name for it! For example, right now, more and more light-sensitive Blind Corpses had arrived, and they had already stuffed the entire tomb passageway full! Shen Qingqiu rushed out of the tomb passageway and scrambled inside of a room. It was very spacious and imposing, and there was a coffin sitting in the middle of it. He vaulted up to it and tried to lift the lid, but it didn’t move. He then hit it, which created a heavy noise, but it still didn’t budge a single inch. The material this coffin was made of was actually much more solid than the one that he was just lying in. Shen Qingqiu thought, Could there be someone inside? He knocked against the lid of the coffin. “May I borrow this to hide in temporarily?” He was originally just blurting something out, but unexpectedly, after he knocked twice, a voice actually responded from inside. The voice was clearly coming from inside the coffin, but it was as crisp as if it was right next to his ears, not muffled in the slightest. It seemed to carry the hint of a laugh. “Please help yourself.” Holy shit. A real reanimated corpse! Shen Qingqiu was terrified. With a sweep of his leg, he swept off several Blind Corpses that threw themselves onto the stone coffin. He leaped off of the stone coffin with two steps before sending several explosive attacks towards the ceiling. Crushed rock crumbled down. Shen Qingqiu saw that it was softening as he hit it, so he continued to attack it furiously. It would be best if he could make the ceiling collapse so he could take advantage of the chaos to run away, buryingall the Blind Corpses and the reanimated corpse underneath the rubble. But amidst the melee, the sound of dark hissing suddenly came from outside of the mausoleum hall."
"天琅君笑眯眯地道： “ 我对峰主可是神往已久。 ” 沈清秋深深体会到 , 气度这种东西 , 果然不是单纯的挂逼附带物，还是要靠家世和从小的教 养来刷。 不说别的 , 让这对父子坐同一副棺材 , 摆同样的 pose ，天琅君可以坐出王族的雍容效果，洛 冰河虽然长得帅 …… 呃 , 大概坐出的还是棺材的效果。 和两位天魔血系的传承者，处在同一个空间 , 并且这个空间里还有不少魔界贵族的干湿粽 子在围观 , 沈清秋表示压力非常大。 他皮笑肉不笑，道： “ 不敢当。既然神往已久 , 为何阁下不出 …… 出来一聚呢？ ” 再怎么装 b, 坐棺材里面装，也太不像话了。除非  他站不起来。 天琅君手指缓慢而规律地敲打着棺沿，瞳孔里倒映出墓室跳动的幽绿火光。 他愉悦地说： “ 好啊。可否请峰主助我一把？ ” 有诈有诈。绝对有诈！ 有诈也要硬着头皮上。沈清秋微微一欠上身，朝他伸出一只手： “ 请？ ” 天琅君欣然扶住，站了起来。 原来不是为了隐藏某些弱点啊。沈清秋略感失望。 然后，拽了个空。 可他手里明明还感觉握着天琅君的小臂。沈清秋目光下转，低头一看。 的确还握着，但是也只剩下一条小臂了。 沈清秋面无表情。 天琅君掉了一截手臂，空了半边袖子，仍很有礼貌： “ 啊。又断了。劳烦峰主把它递给 我。 ” 沈清秋： “……” 靠靠靠靠靠！ 好惊悚！！！ 你特么是人偶吗关节可以随意拆卸？！ 沈清秋的手不顾心灵的颤抖，蛋定地把那截小臂递给了天琅君。后者和竹枝郎都一脸习以 为常，咔擦一声，真的是咔擦一声！就把手臂接回去了！接回去了！ 天琅君活动了一下接回的部分，莞尔道： “ 见笑了。 ” 沈清秋留意到，不止断口之处，那条手臂上不少地方，筋脉血肉都变成了紫黑色，在偏白 的皮肤上格外骇人。甚至他领口下方，也延伸出来半片淡淡的乌色。 沈清秋沉吟片刻，道： “ 露华芝。 ” 他这只蝴蝶扇了一下翅膀，引起的可不只是一场海啸。 头先猜测，竹枝郎极可能把露华芝采去替天琅君塑身了，果然没错。 只是，这具日月露华芝塑成的身体，天琅君恐怕用的不太顺心。 沈清秋之所以魂魄与露芝契合度不错，第一，露芝是用他血气养出来的；第二，露芝是灵 气作物，沈清秋也是以灵气为修炼基础，二者从属性上来说，浑然相合。 然而，天琅君情况却不一样。 他是魔族，修为以魔气为基础，露华芝会有自发的排斥反应，肉身保鲜效果得不到保障。 出现这种躯体被侵蚀的状况，也不是不可能。 天琅君一点也不忌讳这个话题。 “ 正是如此。说起来，能离开白露山，其中也有沈峰主的一份功劳。 ” 沈清秋瞅瞅默然站立一旁的竹枝郎，忆起当初他白露林中的形象，实在是 …… 非常之不 好。简直是惨不忍睹。可即便是这样，天琅君被高山镇压的那些年，他居然一直不曾退出 白露山，得了露芝，也没给自己用，而是毫不犹豫帮主子塑了身。 好一曲忠诚的赞歌！ 沈清秋口里答话，眼角余光却在墓殿中的壁画上扫动。 他心不在焉道： “ 功在喜 …… 竹枝郎。白露山蛰伏数年，终于等到了机会。有此得力下属 ，天琅君真令人羡艳非常。 ” 天琅君道： “ 我这个外甥的座右铭你没听过吗？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 听过。滴水之恩，涌泉相报嘛。 ” 竹枝郎红了脸，在幽绿的烛光下看十分诡异，道： “ 沈仙师莫要取笑于我。 ” 沈清秋可没取笑他，他正一门心思琢磨壁画。 这壁画色泽鲜艳，笔触狂潦，但能看出，正对大殿门口的，是一张巨大的女人脸孔，双眼 弯弯，嘴角上扬，正是一幅喜不自胜的模样。 沈清秋暗暗判断，这间墓殿，是圣陵 “ 喜怒哀 ” 三座圣殿之中的 “ 喜殿 ” 无疑。 这个信息，将会非常有用。 天琅君并未觉察异样，说道： “ 他就是这样，脑子转不过弯。所以才一直向我恳求要带你 来魔界。 ” 沈清秋一直搞不明白这种逻辑，略略回神，看了竹枝郎一眼： “ 要我来魔界，和报恩究竟 有什么联系？ ” 天琅君从容道： “ 当然有联系。因为四大派一个都不能留下，若沈峰主现在还在苍穹山派 ，便也在这范围之内。他自然不希望你留在那里。 ” 沈清秋不知道该接什么话了。 刚才还觉得这位看上去是个讲道理的主儿，现在看看 …… 跟所有雄心勃勃的大中小 boss 也 没什么区别。目标都是 “ 毁灭世界、杀光正派 ” 。 不过话说回来，一个魔界大好青年，怀揣着对人族的热爱，却无缘无故被镇压了这么多年 ，心生怨恨也是应该的。沈清秋无语片刻，配合地问道： “ 下一步是把整个人族灭绝么？ ” 天琅君奇怪道： “ 为什么这么想？当然不会。我喜欢人。只是不喜欢四大派。 ” 他笑了笑，道： “ 我有一份礼物要送给人界。 ” “ 礼物 ” 。呵呵。 绝对不是什么能绑上丝带让人心情愉悦的东西！沈清秋正想吐槽，突然，墓殿陷入一阵突 如其来的震颤之中。 天顶沙石簌簌而落，沈清秋脚底站得稳，却晃得厉害，隐隐还能听到某种生物在远方撼天 动地的嘶吼之声。他警惕道： “ 什么东西？ ” 天琅君凝神听了片刻，道： “ 来的比我想象的要快。 ” 他转向竹枝郎： “ 多少？ ” 竹枝郎道： “ 最少两百只。 ” 天琅君笑道： “ 捕获十只都算了不得了，也真难为他。 ” 沈清秋听不懂，看来他们也不打算跟他交流一下让他听懂。天琅君拨了拨肩头落下的一缕 沙灰，道： “ 沈峰主，我这外甥可是拼了命的腰帮你和苍穹山派一刀两断，不知你意下如 何？愿意跟他走吗？ ” 这都直接把人掳祖坟里来了还问个屁啊问！ 不对 …… 一刀两断？ 沈清秋心中一动，脱口而出： “ 金兰城，撒种人。就是让我和苍穹山派一刀两断的契机？ ” 一刀两断。想来想去，现在他有山不得归，一切的源头都是从金兰城开始的。 沈清秋一字一句质问： “ 当时那个突然指向我的撒种人，是你们安排的？ ” 竹枝郎低了低头。天琅君拍拍他肩膀，似在鼓励： “ 那原本只是为了解决南疆魔族食物紧 缺的一个小试验。不想沈峰主刚好在场，他也只是想让沈峰主彻底断绝回归人界的心思罢 了。 ” 沈清秋立刻对这竹枝郎怒目而视。 说好的报恩就是这个，找撒种人来抹黑他，坑爹呢？！蛇的报恩果然不靠谱！ 竹枝郎低声道： “ 沈仙师，君上说要抹消四大派，就绝不会留一人存活 …… 在下是真心想 ……” 沈清秋压着怒气，说： “ 秋海棠也是你找来的？ ” 天琅君道： “ 不认识。 ” 他看了看竹枝郎，后者立刻看向沈清秋： “ 那女子并非在下寻来 的。 ” 那突然出现的秋海棠和撒种人左右夹击沈清秋，逼得他不得不主动被幻花宫押进水牢，难 道只是巧合？ 是不是都也无所谓了。沈清秋道： “ 除此之外的原因？ ” 天琅君慢悠悠地道： “ 召沈峰主前来，的确也有我自己的私心。 ” 他叹息了一声，道： “ 我那个儿子，这么多年来真是劳烦沈峰主照顾有加了。 ” 果然是为了洛冰河。 虽然早有预感，和他脱不了关系。沈清秋还是心中一紧。 沈清秋勉强打起精神，道： “ 洛冰河？又关他什么事。 ” 天琅君噗嗤笑了一声，低头道： “ 怎么说呢？我发现他对沈峰主，非常之 ……” 他话说的暧昧不清，甚至答非所问，沈清秋却很容易能做出一大串联想推测。 随着天琅君使用这具身体的时间越长，魔气越盛，修为恢复得越多，肉身就会愈加残破， 到处打满补丁。他迟早需要一个新的身体。 有血缘关系。同为天魔血系传承人，并且因为混血关系，自带两套系统。 有谁的身体比洛冰河的更合适？ 沈清秋眯了眯眼： “ 召我回魂，目的是引他前来圣陵？ ” 天琅君道： “ 沈峰主真是明白人。 ” 沈清秋提醒他： “ 洛冰河现在还没坐上你原先的位置，不能进入圣陵，就算他想来，也来 不了。 ” 天琅君却像对他很有信心，道： “ 只要他想，就一定能够来。 ” 沈清秋缓缓地说： “ 不管你想做什么，那可是你儿子。 ” 天琅君道： “ 的确。 ” “ 你和苏夕颜的亲生儿子。 ” 天琅君道： “ 所以？ ” 听到这里，沈清秋终于确信了。 天琅君谈及洛冰河的寥寥几句中，虽然微笑不减，可言辞神情之中，透出一种冷酷无情。 正版的天琅君以往在沈清秋脑子里那种热爱和平深情似海的形象出入太大了。他提到苏夕 颜的时候，语气都不带个颤。喜欢称洛冰河为 “ 我这儿子 ” ，可分毫不觉得他有任何父子的 概念。 他不光不是一个和平爱好者、连爱情至上主义者也不是。完全颠覆了沈清秋长久以来（一 厢情愿）的认知。 其实这也正常，对于情感，魔族本来就疏离冷淡，他们更注重口腹之欲，崇尚权势和力 量。只是，怎么也不至于是这种满不在乎的态度，沈清秋多少有些不舒服。 洛冰河真是 …… 真正的爹不疼娘不爱 [ 蜡烛 ] 。 尤其是想到金兰城这个黑锅沈清秋一直都扣在洛冰河头上，这孩子委委屈屈被糊了一脸那 么久，申辩了几次也直接被无视。而且不久之前他们刚分开时，自己还暴打了他一顿。 沈清秋真心觉得 …… 有点对不起他。 墓殿刚陷入一阵死寂，第二阵百兽咆哮和地动山摇降临，打破了一池死水。 这次来势愈加凶猛，几乎逼近天崩地裂之势。沈清秋下盘再稳也站不住了，他单手扶着棺 材： “ 有谁能告诉我，这到底是什么东西吗？ ” “ 什么 ” 还没说完，墓殿上方嵌满宝石的天顶突然大片大片倾塌下来，殿中三人都反应极快 ，远远让开。一声巨响，有个沉重的东西砸了下来，落在墓殿正中央，烟尘滚滚和晶光乱 闪里，现出一团庞然黑影。 洛冰河踩在一头通体漆黑的巨兽上，黑衣共白尘乱飞，心魔剑在背后凛然出鞘，一双眼睛 赤光流转，正杀气腾腾俯视下方。 那头巨兽乍看略像犀牛，头顶一只弯如月勾的独角，可张嘴一声长号，居然从血红的口腔 里吐出一只盘旋的赤色巨蟒，犀叫混杂着蟒蛇嘶鸣，尤为震撼。 真！黑！月！蟒！犀！ 黑+ 月 + 蟒 + 犀。原来黑月蟒犀就是这四个元素简单搭配组合而成的！向天打飞机菊苣的取 名风格一如既往的实在！ 竹枝郎立刻尽职尽责地挡在天琅君面前，顺便也挡在了沈清秋面前。沈清秋一见洛冰河， 下意识往竹枝郎身后靠了靠。 问心有愧啊问心有愧，他现在是真不知道该怎么面对这个倒霉孩子。 更不敢去想，洛冰河在亲眼看着他的肉身枯萎时，会是什么样的心情。只能掩耳盗铃一下 ，作眼不见心不乱状。 天琅君挑了挑眉，这个动作也和洛冰河有八分神似： “ 不惜捕获两百头黑月蟒犀来破除圣 陵的结界。沈峰主，我这个儿子，对你还真是很不一样。 ” 沈清秋无可反驳。这可是原著中连无间深渊都能吼开的稀有魔兽，为了突破圣陵，洛冰河 居然能一次性抓来两百头。 洛冰河沉着脸从蟒犀头上跃下，那巨兽像是耗尽了气力，再也坚持不住，轰然倒地。他死 死盯着沈清秋，眼里火花崩炸，又激愤又像要哭的样子。 沈清秋突然反应过来，他刚才往竹枝郎身后闪的举动，太像是在嫌弃洛冰河了！ 烟尘散去之后，沈清秋才看清，洛冰河竟是单形只影闯的圣陵。圣陵是魔族圣地同时也是 禁地，无论哪一个，本土魔族都会心怀敬畏，不敢触犯。这是信仰问题，谁也不敢跟着一 起来，他当然只能单形只影。 沈清秋终于喝道： “ 回去！ ” 站在这里的可是原作者都盖章 “ 不知道该怎么让男主打败 ” 的男主他爹啊！ 洛冰河不答话，一抬手，修雅剑抛出，看沈清秋接住后，这才转脸，对着墓殿中另外两人 ，两团烈烈翻滚的魔气分挟在掌中，身形虚闪，直接送了过去。 这就交上手了？！ 洛冰河左手砸中竹枝郎小腹，毫无悬念地把他击飞。右手则撞向天琅君。 沈清秋定睛凝神观望。 天琅君接住了！一步未退，反手轻轻划下，在洛冰河肩部一擦。 沈清秋发誓，他听到了洛冰河身上传来骨折的声音。 仿佛是为了验证这一点，洛冰河眨了眨眼，毫无预兆的，一口鲜血涌了出来。 他整个下巴和脖子胸膛都被一片污红，还在滴滴落地。洛冰河擦了擦嘴角，看上去还有些 茫然。 说真的，他已经很久没体会过 * 受伤吐血的感觉了。 说！好！的！男！主！挂！逼！金！身！不！破！定！律！呢！ 不坑爹改坑儿子了么！","CHAPTER 57: HOLY MAUSOLEUM Shen Qingqiu raised his head. It was as if two bright yellow lanterns had appeared outside the palace hall, the pair of piercing golden eyes staring wide- eyed at the scene. In the middle of each eye was a vertical pupil, which appeared to be unusually sinister. The crowd of blind corpses, upon hearing this sound, seemed to be intimidated by some invisible force. They no longer resumed with their tearing and pouncing; instead, they withdrew into themselves, lowering their heads and shrinking back their shoulders. Eventually, they retreated into a tight huddle, trembling. That pair of large lantern-like eyes stared straight at Shen Qingqiu for a moment, until they suddenly looked away. After a while, a figure emerged outside of the palace hall. Shen Qingqiu, identifying the new visitor, wasn’t surprised. He called out pleasantly, “Xizhi-Lang 212 .” Zhuzhi-Lang slipped mid-step. He rubbed his nose. Although he was depressed, he wasn’t one to be rude. Smiling, he said, “Since Master Shen is willing to address me like this, then please feel free to continue to do so.” Shen Qingqiu said, “The person who stole the corpse from the Palace Hall vault really was you.” The bluish-black poison that covered the entire body was most likely the venom of the jade serpent. The reason why Mu Qingfan’s cursory inspection had been unable to find a wound was probably because the snake’s fangs were too small to leave a visible mark. If one were to examine the bodies more closely, they would find small tooth marks on the fingertips or the bottom of the heels. Zhuzhi-Lang said, “The situation happened too quickly. I had no choice but to continue on to the next stage of the plan. I hope Master Shen will be magnanimous enough to forgive me.” Shen Qingqiu coughed dryly. “The situation happened too quickly”; no matter how you considered it, this “situation” was caused entirely by him when he had fumigated realgar wine to subdue Zhuzhi-Lang, turning the other party back into their original form. Not only that but adding insult to injury, he had furthermore ridden Zhuzhi-Lang’s snake form for an entire stretch of the road. He said, “You summoned me from the Holy Mausoleum, which can be said to have solved one of my… difficulties. Before, you wanted me to go to theDemon Realm. Now that I’m here, can you finally tell me your purpose?” Zhuzhi-Lang said, “Reason number one, I’ve already explained to Master Shen. Since you’ve helped me, I will repay the favor many times over 213 . As for the second reason, Master Shen wasn’t exactly summoned by the humble me… it’s better to ask Junshang directly.” Shen Qingqiu said, “Alright. Where is Tianlang-Jun, then?” Zhuzhi-Lang stared blankly, before saying, “I thought that Master Shen and Junshang had already met.” Already met? Shen Qingqiu lowered his head and stared at the stone sarcophagus. Could it be that the corpse inside… was Tianlang-Jun? Strictly speaking, this couldn’t even be called “meeting,” okay? The coffin lid that he had just spent some time on trying to open without budging suddenly began to shake, opening by itself. Inside, a person slowly sat up. This person set an elbow against the edge of the coffin, a faint smile appearing on his face. He said, “Qing Jing Peak Lord, I have long awaited the honor of meeting you.” Shen Qingqiu was stunned. This whole family’s interests were wide and extensive, but it seemed eventually all of their hobbies were the same kind of eccentric. The son enjoyed hugging corpses, the father enjoyed lying inside a coffin. If one were to look at Luo Binghe’s overall appearance, he resembled his mother, Su Xiyan. However, it was still possible to see some of his father’s genes. For example, his eyes. Tianlang-Jun’s eyes were large and profound, his tapered eyebrows emphasizing his brave and outstanding appearance. His black pupils were like two impossibly deep voids, a feature that Luo Binghe shared identically. The original Luo Binghe was a pretty boy. If he had received his mother’s eyes, his appearance would be considered excessively feminine and soft, which wasn’t good. Another similarity could be seen in their smiles. The smiling expressions of this father and son pair made Shen Qingqiu feel a hard-to-describe emotion… it was a feeling that was anything but reassuring. Shen Qingqiu cautiously said, “I haven’t been a Peak Lord for many years.” Tianlang-Jun crinkled his eyes as he smiled. “But I’ve been fascinatedwith the Peak Lord for quite a while.” Shen Qingqiu knew profoundly from experience that presence was something taught from childhood and family background. Not accounting for anything else, if someone were to sit this pair of father and son inside a coffin and have them strike the exact same pose, Tianlang-Jun’s regal presence could transform sitting in a coffin into sitting on the Dragon Throne. On the other hand, though Luo Binghe was undoubtedly handsome… eh, it would probably still look like he was sitting in a coffin. No wonder Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky had felt that Tianlang-Jun was a threat, and decisively cut him out of the plot. To be sitting in the presence of two Heavenly Demons, and in a space where he was surrounded by the decomposing bodies of the demon race’s elders, Shen Qingqiu felt that the pressure on him was extremely huge. He put on a fake smile, saying, “I don’t dare to accept this praise. And since your honor has been observing me for so long, why haven’t you come out… come out to meet me?” No matter how much Tianlang-Jun put up a front, spending all of his time inside a coffin was really too outrageous. Unless He couldn’t stand up. Tianlang-Jun’s finger slowly tapped against the edge of the coffin, his pupils reflecting the throbbing green flames within the mausoleum. He cheerfully said, “Alright. Is it possible to ask Peak Lord to assist me, then?” Being scammed really made one reluctant. Shen Qingqiu slowly sighed, and then reached out to him. “Please.” Tianlang-Jun gladly took hold of his hand and stood up. So sitting in a coffin wasn’t because he was concealing some kind of weakness. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but feel some disappointment. And then, he was pulling at nothing. But he was still clearly grabbing Tianlang-Jun’s wrist. Shen Qingqiu glanced downwards, lowering his head. He indeed was still holding onto it, except all that remained was an arm. Shen Qingqiu’s face lost all expression. Tianlang-Jun, having lost an arm, his sleeve half-empty, was still very polite. “Ah. It broke again. Can I inconvenience Peak Lord to pick it up for me again?” Shen Qingqiu: “…” Despite how violent a shock his soul had suffered, Shen Qingqiu stillmanaged to calmly pass that arm back to Tianlang-Jun. Behind them, Zhuzhi- Lang, wearing an expression of having seen this scene many times, with a ka- cha sound (really, a ka-cha sound!) reattached the hand. Reattached it! Are you a damned doll? Can your joints be attached and detached at will? After careful scrutiny, Shen Qingqiu realized that there were many scars on Tianlang-Jun’s arm. All over, the muscles, tendons, and arteries had turned black, a sight made especially shocking when contrasted against Tianlang-Jun’s stark white skin. Even below the collars of his robes, small black scars could be seen snaking out. Shen Qingqiu decided resolutely not to say anything. This was like the flap of a butterfly’s wings causing a tsunami. He had guessed earlier that Zhuzhi-Lang had taken the Sun and Moon Flower Seed to create a new body for Tianlang-Jun, a conjecture that now appeared to be correct. It was just that Tianlang-Jun did not seem to be very compatible with this new body. The reason why Shen Qingqiu’s soul and the flower seed body had good synchronization was because, one, the flower seed was something that was born out of his own blood and vital breath; and two, the flower seed was a plant made of spiritual energy, something Shen Qingqiu also used to advance his own cultivation. Therefore, with these two reasons, it was no wonder they had fit so well with each other. However, Tianlang-Jun’s situation was different. He was a demon, and thus his foundation was built on demonic energy. Naturally, the seed would attempt to reject him. As a result, the quality of the body wasn’t guaranteed, and it was even possible to have circumstances when the body began to corrode. Tianlang-Jun moved his reattached parts, smiling as he said, “I’ve incurred ridicule. Speaking of it, it’s possible for us to leave Bailu Mountain. That’s how we were able to witness Peak Lord Shen’s merit.” Shen Qingqiu cast a glance at Zhuzhi-Lang, who was standing to the side. Originally, when they had first met in the Bailu Forest, that human-snake form was really… too horrible to look at. But even so, through all the years when Tianlang-Jun had been suppressed in the mountains, he had never left Bailu Forest. Afterward, when he received the Lotus seed, he did not use it on himself but rather without hesitation used it to mold a body for his master. What a loyal subordinate!Shen Qingqiu’s eyes swept across the murals on the Palace Hall, perfunctorily saying, “Much merit to Xi… to Zhuzhi-Lang. To live in seclusion in Bailu Mountain and wait for so many years for an opportunity; having such a capable subordinate, Tianlang-Jun really causes others to feel envy.” Tianlang-Jun said, “Have you not heard of my nephew’s motto?” Shen Qingqiu said: “I’ve heard it. A favor given is paid back many times over.” Zhuzhi-Lang’s red face looked extremely weird underneath the mossy green candlelight. He said, “Lord and Master Shen are teasing me.” Shen Qinqiu did not intend to tease him; he was exerting all of his attention on studying a mural instead. This mural’s colors were bright and gaudy, and the brush strokes mad and frenzied. Still, it was possible to discern that the image directly facing the Mausoleum’s entrance way was the large face of a woman. Her eyes were crinkled into crescents and the corners of her lips pointed upwards as if she was unable to suppress her joy. This section of the mausoleum was definitely the “Hall of Delight” of the Holy Mausoleum’s three “Delight, Fury, and Sorrow” temples. Tianlang-Jun had not sensed anything strange yet. He said, “He’s just like this. His mind can only think straight-forwardly. That’s why he’s always begged me to take you to the Demon World.” Shen Qingqiu had never understood this kind of reasoning. Turning around slightly, he looked at Zhuzhi-Lang. “What does bringing me to the Demon World and returning a favor have to do with each other?” Tianlang-Jun calmly said, “Of course it’s connected. The four great sects cannot be allowed to remain. As Peak Lord Shen is still with the Cang Qiong Sect and thus falls into this scope, Zhuzhi-Lang naturally doesn’t want you to stay in that place.” Shen Qingqiu didn’t know how to respond. He had initially thought that Tianlang-Jun was relatively reasonable. However, after conversing with him, he now discovered that this man was virtually indistinguishable from any of those ambitious “destroy the world, kill the good” kind of BOSSes! But if one were to consider it, an idealistic, expectant youth of a noble bloodline had been suppressed by members of a different race under a mountain for so many years. A deep-rooted resentment was entirely to be expected. Shen Qingqiu paused, then asked, “Is the next step extinguishing all ofhumanity?” Tianlang-Jun seemed confused. “Why would you think like that? Of course not. I like humans, just not the four great sects.” He smiled, then continued: “In contrary, I have a gift to give to the human race.” Although he didn’t know what this so-called gift was, it definitely wasn’t some ribbon-wrapped object that would bring humanity great joy! Shen Qingqiu had just begun to spit out a rather out-of-practice “fuck” when suddenly, the mausoleum began to shake. The gravel on the ground quaked. Shen Qingqiu’s two feet were steady against the ground, but his body couldn’t help but sway wildly. In the distance, he could even faintly hear an earth-shaking yelling noise. Cautiously, he asked, “What is it?” Tianlang-Jun listened carefully for a moment. “They’ve arrived a lot faster than I thought.” He turned towards Zhuzhi-Lang. “How many?” Zhuzhi-Lang said, “At least two hundred.” Tianlang-Jun smiled: “Just catching ten is extremely difficult, this must hard for him.” Shen Qingqiu couldn’t understand what they were talking about, but it seemed that they had no intention of enlightening him. Tianlang-Jun brushed off a wisp of sand from his shoulder then said: “Peak Lord Shen, since five years ago my nephew has been trying force you to make a clean break with Cang Qiong Mountain sect. What do you think of this? Would you like to go with him?” You’ve practically already brought the person into ancestral tombs and you’re still asking this useless questionwait a second… five years ago? Making a clean break? Shen Qingqiu’s heart lurched. He blurted out: “The Jinlan City sowers. Was that part of your plan to make me leave Cang Qiong Mountain sect?” Now that he thought about it, the reason that he couldn’t return to the sect was because of everything that had started in Jinlan City. Shen Qingqiu asked: “The sower who pointed his finger at me, that was your doing?” Zhuzhi-Lang lowered his head. Tianlang-Jun patted his shoulder as if encouraging him. “Originally, that was just an experiment to solve the southern devil tribes’ food deficiency problems. It just happened that Peak Lord Shen was present. Zhuzhi-Lang only wanted Peak Lord Shen to sever any desire to returnto humanity, that’s all.” Shen Qingqiu immediately glared at Zhuzhi-Lang. So this so-called repayment was getting a sower to defame him, wasn’t this too fraudulent? A snake’s favor really wasn’t reliable! Zhuzhi-Lang said softly, “Master Shen, Junshang said that he wanted to eliminate all of the four great sects, without leaving a single person alive… this humble person sincerely didn’t want, at that time…” Shen Qingqiu suppressed his anger, saying: “Qiu Haitang was also your doing?” Tianlang-Jun said, “I don’t recognize the name.” He looked at Zhuzhi- Lang, who turned to look at Shen Qingqiu. Zhuzhi-Lang said, “That woman really isn’t someone that I found.” The suddenly-appearing Qiu Haitang and sower people attacking Shen Qingqiu left-right in a pincer attack, forcing him to surrender to the Huan Hua Palace and become imprisoned in the water prison, really was just a coincidence? Forget it. Now that things had come to this, it no longer mattered. Shen Qingqiu said, “What’s the other reason?” Tianlang-Jun calmly replied, “Summoning Peak Lord Shen here was also because of my own selfishness.” He sighed. “That son of mine, to raise him for so many years really has been an inconvenience for Peak Lord Shen.” Although he had long suspected that this matter had to do with Luo Binghe, hearing his name still made Shen Qingqiu’s heart tremble. He begrudgingly tried to pump himself up, before asking: “Luo Binghe? What does this have to do with him?” Tianlang-Jun snorted, lowering his head. “How do I say this? I’ve noticed that towards Peak Lord Shen, he’s extremely…” Although his words were vague and unclear, dodging the question entirely, Shen Qingqiu still did not have any difficulty stringing together a theory. As the time Tianlang-Jun possessed this body for increased, as his demonic energy became more vigorous and his cultivation began to recover, the body he used would begin to fall apart more and more, requiring touch-ups all over. Sooner or later, he would require a new body. This body would work best if it was someone related to him, a similar heavenly demon. If this body happened to be a hybrid and was capable of using two separate cultivation systems, it would only be even better.Whose body was more suitable than Luo Binghe’s? Shen Qingqiu narrowed his eyes. “So the reason why you called back my soul was to draw him to the Holy Mausoleum?” Tianlang-Jun said, “Peak Lord Shen is a perceptive person.” Shen Qingqiu warned him, “Luo Binghe hasn’t taken over your original position yet. He can’t enter the Holy Mausoleum, even if he wanted to.” Tianlang-Jun looked at him confidently. “As long as he wants to, he’ll definitely be able to come.” Shen Qingqiu slowly said, “No matter what you want to do, this is your son.” Tianlang-Jun said, “Indeed.” “Yours and Su Xiyan’s son.” Tianlang-Jun said, “So?” Hearing these words, Shen Qingqiu was finally convinced. In the few sentences that Tianlang-Jun mentioned Luo Binghe, although his smiling expression remained the same, his words and expressions were all cold. That image of a loving and fair Tianlang-Jun in Shen Qingqiu’s mind immediately disappeared. Now, he realized that whenever Tianlang-Jun spoke about Su Xiyan, his tone never wavered. He fondly referred to Luo Binghe as “this son of mine,” but one would hardly think that they shared any father-son relationship. Not only was Tianlang-Jun not a pacifist, but he was no romantic either. This completely subverted Shen Qingqiu’s long-held (and perhaps wishful) thinking. Actually, this was normal. The demon clan looked at emotions with cold contempt, much preferring good food, influence, and power. It was just that seeing this “couldn’t care less” attitude in person, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t but feel uncomfortable. Luo Binghe really was… an unloved child. Shen Qingqiu had always used that blackened pot of Jinlan City to smash against Luo Binghe’s head. This child, wearing such a face of aggrievement for so long, had tried to defend himself for so many times, but to no avail. Not long ago when they separated, Shen Qingqiu had even used harsh words to rebuke him. He was extremely resentful against Tianlang-Jun. However, if one were toconsider it, he himself was not much better. He had hurt Luo Binghe deeply. The tomb had just fallen into a deathly silence when the second wave of animals roaring and battle descended. This time it was even more vicious, the sounds of upheaval drawing closer by the moment. At this point, Shen Qingqiu was unable to stand for any longer. Gripping onto the coffin, he asked, “Can someone explain to me what exactly is going on?” Before he could finish the “what,” all of the precious stones embedded on the mausoleum began to drop off. All three of the people inside the palace hall had quick reactions, quickly stepping far out of the way. With a sudden crash, an extremely heavy object smashed through the roof of the palace hall, landing in the middle of the room. The smoke and dust intermingled with the rays of light from above, revealing a black figure. Luo Binghe stood on the head of a pitch-black giant beast, his black robes billowing wildly in the dust. The Xin Mo sword lay unsheathed on his back. A pair of eyes glinted red in the light, overlooking the scene with ferocious killing intent."
"天琅君只轻轻拍了洛冰河肩膀一掌 , 那只手臂便又断了。他皱了皱眉 , 竹枝郎立即代为拾起 ，双手呈上。 洛冰河也不去擦拭鲜血 , 眼中闪过凶光，反手握住背上心魔。天琅君道： “ 剑是把好剑。可 惜用法乱七八糟。 ” 洛冰河冲沈清秋低声喝道： “ 走！ ” 走什么走？走得了吗！ 竹枝郎道： “ 迟了 , 两百头黑月蟒犀也只不过能让圣陵结界打开一瞬 , 放你进来而已。 ” 洛冰河厉声道： “ 那就用你们两个做血祭 , 再开一次！ ” 谁知，心魔剑还未完全出鞘，就猛地又插回了鞘中。天琅君不知什么时候已站到他身后 , 一只手指就把剑压回鞘里 , 竟是不让他把剑 □□ 。洛冰河反应也快极，转身迎击。谁知无论 他多快，每次心魔都只能拔出最多三寸，随即就被压回。几个来回，天琅君似乎失去了兴 趣，手腕一翻，不管心魔，而是直接压在了他的天灵上。 洛冰河双眼猝睁，一团浓郁的紫黑之气在他天灵上方翻卷，不知道天琅君正在做什么，他 竟说不出话来。 天琅君闭目一阵，睁开双眼道： “ 原来不止你一人，还捎带了两条小鱼进来。 ” 他提起手，对着洛冰河那张脸看了看，客观地评价道： “ 像他母亲。 ” 一旁传来一个冷冷的声音： “ 眼睛像你。 ” 天琅君缓缓回头。 修雅剑寒光闪闪，横在竹枝郎颈间。沈清秋道： “ 这么好的下属，没了可不划算。天琅君 是不是该斟酌一下？ ” 竹枝郎低声道： “ 君上，属下一时疏忽。 ” 都“ 一时疏忽 ” 了还这么难搞！沈清秋费了老大劲才把他制住。这人不化蛇形的时候也一样 滑溜！ 天琅君缓缓道： “ 你这么对竹枝郎，他会伤心的。 ” 沈清秋半真半假道： “ 你这么对你儿子，我也会伤心。你放开你儿子，我放开你外甥，如 何？ ” 天琅君道： “ 只怕不给我这个机会。 ” 沈清秋手心其实全是冷汗，可声音听上去极其冷静： “ 我正在给你这个机会。 ” 天琅君道： “ 我是指，竹枝郎不会给我这个机会。 ” 话音未落，竹枝郎猛地主动朝沈清秋剑尖撞去！ 这一下力道非常，真的是拼死之势，绝无半分作假嫌疑。沈清秋吃了一惊，下意识撤剑。 剑锋一收，竹枝郎趁势脱身，闪回天琅君身旁。 天琅君做了个 “ 你看吧 ” 的表情，笑道： “ 若要我为他受要挟，竹枝郎会自求一死，沈峰主 可千万别小看他。 ” 沈清秋气得要吐血。作为人质，竹枝郎真是完全没有价值可言。好不容易挟持一次，完全 没有成就感！ 天琅君道： “ 我外甥受了点委屈，理应在沈峰主徒弟身上讨回来。 ” 说着，五指微微收拢。 洛冰河闷哼一声，眼角有鲜血流出，可眼珠还艰难地转向沈清秋那边，咬住牙里的血沫， 道： “…… 走！去哪儿都好 …… 别待在这里！ ” 沈清秋猛地抬头，修雅剑向正前方掷出。仿佛白电横闪，急刺向天琅君，他微一偏头，剑 锋擦着他的脸颊，铛的一声，钉在身后远处画壁上。 他道： “ 准头不大好。 ” 沈清秋慢慢收回手，一勾嘴角： “ 很准。正中靶心。 ” 天琅君微微一怔，当即回头。 只见修雅剑正正钉在壁画上微笑女人面孔的一只眼睛上。原本镶嵌在瞳孔部位的宝石碎成 数片，闪烁着落下石壁。 那女人明明只是画在墙上的一张脸，可弯弯勾起的嘴角越勾越翘，竟像是越笑越开心，一 只咧嘴咧到了耳朵边，仿佛裂口女的血盆大口。 突然，墓殿之中，爆发出尖锐无比的大笑声。而这笑声，正是从壁画上的女人嘴里发出来 的！ 喜殿有防盗措施。一面墙壁上都是镶嵌的宝石，可你只要撬下来一块，就等着被喜殿魔女 的音波武器活生生笑死吧！ 这笑声对魔族功效尤为明显，毕竟本来就是为了防备魔族，没有哪些人会闲得没事来魔界 盗墓的。一入耳朵，心脏和脑筋突突狂跳不止，一阵锐痛，天旋地转，眼睛发花。竹枝郎 忍不住捂起了耳朵，天琅君也抽出一只手按住了太阳穴。沈清秋早有准备，趁这一瞬间的 机会，倏地掠过，左手一扬，修雅剑应声回鞘，右手抓起洛冰河就跑！ 冲进下一座墓殿，沈清秋第一件事就是放下闸门，放死！沉重的巨石应声落地，激起乱尘 ，他只找到关门机关，没找到开门的，开不了最好！他刚刚这么想，好不容易放了心，回 头一看，险些给跪了。 竹枝郎一只手被他紧紧拽着，眨了眨眼。 醉了醉了。这也能拎错人！！！造的是什么孽，他居然把那对正在单方面家暴的父子留在 了喜殿啊啊啊！ 罪过啊罪过！！！沈清秋甩开手转身就要去劈石门，竹枝郎扯住他： “ 沈仙师，你别回去 了。君上面前，他没有胜算的。 ” 沈清秋要抓狂了。 究竟为什么这么近也能搞错人？！都怪喜殿那画壁女笑声攻击力太强，绿烛昏昏，三个人 又都穿的是乍看差不多的黑衣服。因为亲戚所以对颜色款式的喜好都差不多吗？！ 沈清秋被自己蠢哭了，他忍无可忍一锤石门，道： “ 我本来是想和洛冰河在一起啊！ ” 竹枝郎闻言愣住了。 半晌，他才道： “ 沈仙师你和他不是 …… 早就在一起了吗？ ” “……” 跟这群人真是说不清！ 沈清秋抬手让他闭嘴，转身走了几步，忽然觉得脚底不平。 竹枝郎跟了上来，他做了个阻挡的手势： “ 别动！ ” 一张巨大的女人脸孔，铺满了整个大殿地面。他们正踩在这张脸的耳朵上。 和喜殿的女颜不同，这张脸毫无娇媚之态，反而凶神恶煞，目眦欲裂，细目阔鼻，极尽丑 恶之能事，活像个母夜叉。 沈清秋谨慎道： “ 别踩脸。 ” 竹枝郎： “……” 这整个地上都是脸，不让踩脸踩哪儿 …… 喜怒哀三殿一重接一重，过了第一重喜殿之后，紧接着的，就是 “ 怒殿 ” 。 原著洛冰河观（ xi ）光（ jie ）圣陵、打通过这一关时，采用了特定的走位，可惜沈清秋没 记清楚他到底踩得是哪几部。如果不小心踩错了一步，怒殿的防盗措施就会启动。御剑也 是不行的，只要在垂直上方通过，都算是踩。 话说回来，被人踩脸当然生气了！怪不得要怒啊！ 他敢冲进来是因为以为抓的是洛冰河，他肯定知道走位。谁知道会搞出抓错人这种情况！ 看样子喜之郎和天琅君之前都只在第一重喜殿活动，多半是不能指望靠他通关的！ 地面越来越热。沈清秋蹲身，试探了一下温度，沾手立即抽回。烫的像有一把火在地底炙 烤，站在地面上的都是铁板烧的肉料。地上这女颜的脸颊原本是绯红色，正逐渐升温变成 艳红色。 恐怕他们刚才已经不知不觉中在这脸上踩了几脚了。沈清秋退后几步，尽量向侧沿靠拢。 突然，炙亮金黄的红色液体喷泉一样从地面爆发。 竹枝郎一刹那化出原型，一条鳞片闪着荧光的黄眼青蛇盘在地上，立起上身，昂首嘶叫， 足有四人之高。把沈清秋卷成一团，牢牢裹在鳞甲当中。白森森的獠牙挨着沈清秋的脑袋 ，那对金黄大眼近距离看，更加猎奇。 天琅君说的真对，喜之郎果然脑子转不过弯来。之前被雄黄酒熏得迎风流泪不记得了？刚 刚还被他用剑指着也不记得了？现在还这么尽心尽力护着他，简直让沈清秋都不好意思坑 他了。 突然，一声轰隆巨响，怒殿一侧的墙壁整片倒塌下来。硝烟弥漫中，天琅君一边活动手腕 ，一边走下乱石倾墙，踏入怒殿，道： “ 不知道这是不是我的错觉，沈峰主似乎比我还熟 悉这圣陵呢。 ” 竹枝郎化回人形，失声道： “ 君上，别进来！ ” 天琅君还没露出疑问的神色，已经在地上这女人的脸上一连踩了六七步。 沈清秋： “……” 竹枝郎： “……” 一道四人合抱的岩浆巨柱猛地冲天喷起，天琅君瞬间被熊熊火焰吞没。 哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈！！！ 沈清秋心中狂笑不止。让你不听人把话说完！让你殴打亲儿！你装啊，尽管装，装 b 遭雷 劈！ 可他很快就笑不出来了。洛冰河在后面，跌跌撞撞也闯了进来。他一条手臂松松垮垮，似 乎彻底折了，血从头上止不住地流下，一只眼睛都睁不开了。 好惨。这么惨，比他刚过来的那段时间洛冰河被原装货打得惨多了！ 洛冰河这体质究竟是怎么回事！为什么长辈都这么爱用暴力的方式来教育他。又不是百战 峰的！ 竹枝郎围着那火柱团团转，无暇顾及其他。洛冰河把殿内景象尽收眼中，再低头一看，跳 下乱石堆，瞬息之间走出了五六步，来到沈清秋跟前。 不科学，他究竟是怎么只看一眼就知道该怎么走而不引发机关的！ 洛冰河似乎知道他心中在想什么，言简意赅道： “ 走脸上穴位。 ” 说话间，两人已经穿过怒殿，进入下一重。石门闸闸落下时，沈清秋还是忍不住多看了洛 冰河两眼，确认这次没有找错人。 沈清秋站在墓殿边缘，不敢妄动。 “ 哀殿 ” 的主殿魔女，栖落在天顶之上。抬头一看，果然 绘着一张眉峰紧蹙，哀恸婉转的女颜。 觉察有人入侵，那张脸双眼一睁，五官皱挪，表情愈发凄苦，先是淅淅沥沥的水滴从两眼 渗落，没过多久，整个天顶上飘下了密集的雨丝。 他刚要说话提醒这是尸雨，不能沾身，洛冰河扬起一只手，把他护在下面，挟着两人直接 冲了过去 …… 沈清秋： “……” 智商呢！原著你可是技术流，这也太简单粗暴了！！！ 喜怒哀三重殿可是原著打了二十万字的副本，现在换算下来，一章有没有？！哀殿起码拖 拖拉拉打了十章才完，现在呢？三行有木有？！你很赶时间吗？！ 系统嘤咛发来提示：【砍去注水内容，精炼情节， b 格 +100 ！】 砍得太多了！ 出来之后，就是一条黝黑寂静的墓道。两人一离开墓殿，绿色火光幽幽亮起，一排接一排 ，无尽地延伸下去。 圣陵防盗措施简直无孔不入，丧心病狂，咽气烛就像不要成本似的到处乱放。原本在墓道 中无神游荡着的盲尸们流着口水凑了过来。洛冰河举起一只手，神色冷峻又不耐，它们不 甘地低声嘶叫，喉咙里尽是呼噜呼噜的低哮，埋着头缩回黑暗之中。 洛冰河没看沈清秋一眼，松了手，道： “ 走吧。 ” 之前他每次抓到沈清秋，都要盯着死看猛看，这次却不看了。 沈清秋注意到，洛冰河的脸红得厉害，在幽绿的烛光下看，突兀极了。但绝对不是因为害 羞。沈清秋有点怀疑他是不是中毒了，或者被打得脑充血了，可看他脚步还算沉稳，又不 像那么回事。 他想开口问一句，可又不知道怎么问。 沈清秋快要憋出一句时，还是洛冰河先开口了。 似乎每次气氛陷入僵持，都是他先开口打破沉默。 “ 这具身体，灵脉运转可好？ ” 沈清秋没料到他第一句会是这个，愣了一下，答道： “ 正常。 ” 他想起来，这具身体的灵脉，都是洛冰河花了五年时间一点一点修复起来的。 洛冰河点了点头，道： “ 那就好。另外一具身体，我保存了几天，但实在保不下去了。 ” 露华芝躯魂离即死，瞬间枯萎消解，洛冰河居然还能支撑几天，还敢在这之后来圣陵单刀 赴会。沈清秋越发不知道该说什么。 天琅君似乎刚才提过，洛冰河 “ 捎带了两条小鱼 ” ，沈清秋问道： “ 你还带了谁？ ” 洛冰河终于看了他一眼，道： “ 我一个人来的。 ” 顿了顿，他接着说： “ 刚才那两个，不是好相与的角色。师尊就算不想呆在我那里，也希 望不要跟他们一路。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 你之前见过他们？ ” 洛冰河淡声道： “ 之前在南疆遇过那条蛇，交了几次手，险些吃了亏。另外一个没见过， 但我打不过他。 ” 竹枝郎出身南疆，在那边奔走，自然要勤快些。天琅君也说过，金兰城的瘟疫事件本来就 是为解决南疆粮食问题闹出来的。洛冰河在南疆和竹枝郎打过几架，意料中事。 可竹枝郎似乎没对洛冰河说明他的身份，更没将他视为少主。天琅君也瞧着没这么个打 算。 这么看来，父亲和表哥，都没有承认他的意思。 沈清秋心下五味陈杂，正不尴不尬踟蹰着，烛光忽的一闪，墓道暗了一暗，洛冰河的身体 压向了他。 擦，刚刚对这孩子的同情心回来一点，就又来！又来！ 可洛冰河这次没抱着他，也没动手动脚，而是彻底歪倒在他身上，然后就一动不动了。 沈清秋总算发现了蹊跷之处。他也很累了，没支撑住两个人的身体，咚的一下靠在石壁上 ，洛冰河则靠在他身上，软趴趴的，脑袋在墙上磕了一下，发出响亮的撞击声，听得沈清 秋心也跟着一抖，牙根发疼。 他连忙站直，反手抱住洛冰河，一阵摸索，摸到他背部。洛冰河背后衣物破破烂烂，都是 被哀殿尸雨淋出来的的，再往里面探探，皮下肌肤触感诡异，似乎有溃烂迹象。而且已经 发出腥味。 毕竟尸雨可不是什么好东西。 按照沈清秋的叫人习惯，他爱首先上来就左右开弓赏两个小耳刮子，可他这爪子刚伸出去 ，就有点下不了手，于是改为轻轻拍了他脸颊两下，声音也不由自主放轻了： “ 洛冰河？ 洛冰河？ ” 洛冰河沉沉闭着眼睛，睫毛颤都不颤一下，脸色愈发红的不正常。 沈清秋伸手一摸，额头和面颊滚烫，像是发烧。但是洛冰河身上绝对不会存在 “ 发烧 ” 这种 概念。再碰一碰手，手却是冰凉的。他整个人就像头放在微波炉里，身体放在冰窟里。 在沈清秋的概念中，男主即便偶尔有落魄受困的时刻，也不会持续多久，更不会到失去意 识的地步。 沈清秋一手放到洛冰河脑后，揉了揉他刚撞到墙上的地方。 “ 洛冰河，听得清吗？ ” 没有回应。 沈清秋算了一算。为了护住肉身不让其枯萎，洛冰河消耗了几天的灵力（最后还没护住） ；大费周章到处乱抓黑月蟒犀；来圣陵后，先被天琅君拳打脚踢，再正中喜殿音波攻击， 继续被天琅君拳打脚踢，最后是尸雨淋身。 怎么想都比发烧严重多了。","CHAPTER 58: HALL OF DELIGHT, HALL OF FURY, HALL OF SORROW At first glance, the great beast appeared to be some sort of rhinoceros, a single horn curved like the crescent moon atop its head. But, opening its mouth and trumpeting, it spat out a giant scarlet python from its blood-red maw. The rhinoceros’ call mingled with the snake’s hissing cry, creating an especially shocking clamor. Really? Black! Moon! Rhinoceros! Python 214 ! Black + Moon + Rhinoceros + Python. Turns out the Black Moon Rhinoceros Python was really just the simple combination of these four elements. Great God Airplane Shooting Toward the Sky, your naming style is as dependable as always! Zhuzhi-Lang diligently moved to stand in front of Tianlang-Jun, conveniently covering Shen Qingqiu as well. Upon seeing Luo Binghe, Shen Qingqiu had subconsciously moved closer to Zhuzhi-Lang’s back. It wasn’t that he was still fleeing Luo Binghe at every opportunity, but that he had a guilty conscience and no face to see him. He didn’t dare think what sort of mood Luo Binghe would be in after seeing him breathe his last breath before his eyes for the second time. He could only subconsciously act like the bell thief who plugged his ears up 215 , pretending that if the eyes could not see, the heart would not be disturbed. Tianlang-Jun raised an eyebrow, this expression also bearing a remarkable resemblance to Luo Binghe. “And he wouldn’t hesitate to capture two hundred Black Moon Rhinoceros Pythons to break the wards around the Holy Mausoleum. Peak Lord Shen, this son of mine really does hold some extraordinary feelings towards you.” Shen Qingqiu had no retort to that. This was the demonic beast which, in the original work, could render even the Endless Abyss with its call. And for breaking into the Holy Mausoleum, Luo Binghe had captured two hundred of them for a single-time use. After the dust settled, Shen Qingqiu could finally see clearly ━ Luo Binghe had indeed single-handedly broken into the Holy Mausoleum. The Holy Mausoleum was both sacred land for the Demon Race and a forbidden area. Any native of the Demon Race would cherish and revere it, not daring to violate the grounds. This was a question of faith ━ no one would dare come with him, so ofcourse, he would be alone. Tianlang-Jun closed his eyes for a spell. Opening them again, he said, “Your courage is commendable. It’s just that while you yourself coming here is no big deal, you should not have brought along these two strays.” Luo Binghe calmly leaped from the Rhinoceros Python’s head. The great beast had exhausted the last of its energy and, unable to continue any longer, fell to the ground with a loud bang. He fixed an unwavering glare on Shen Qingqiu, sparks bursting in his eyes, looking like he was both boiling with anger and about to cry. Shen Qingqiu suddenly had a delayed reaction. Just now he had dodged behind Zhuzhi-Lang ━ it looked too much like he was avoiding Luo Binghe again! But now it was too late for any explanation. The one standing here was the male protagonist’s dad, the one the author stamped with the all-around strength to crush the protagonist into a paste! Shen Qingqiu finally found his voice to yell, “Go back!” Luo Binghe didn’t reply. He raised his hand, tossing over Xiu Ya. Only after seeing Shen Qingqiu catch the sword did he turn towards the other two people standing in the mausoleum hall. Collecting two fiercely roiling balls of demonic energy in his palms, he shot straight over, not bothering to dodge. You’re starting to trade blows already? Luo Binghe’s left hand smashed into Zhuzhi-Lang’s abdomen, sending him flying without the least concern for his welfare. His right hand flew out to hit Tianlang-Jun. Shen Qingqiu was tense from head to toe, watching from the sidelines with rapt attention. And Tianlang-Jun caught the blow! Not retreating a single step, he smoothly turned his hand, sliding through Luo Binghe’s defenses to brush against his shoulder. Shen Qingqiu swore, at that moment he heard Luo Binghe’s bones cracking inside his body. As if to validate this point, Luo Binghe blinked, and without warning, spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. The entirety of his chin, neck, and chest was dyed a field of red, and the blood was still dripping down. Luo Binghe wiped the corner of his mouth, looking like he was still at a loss. To speak the truth, it had already been very long since he had experienced a physical injury serious enough to make him spit blood. Wasn’t! The! Protagonist’s! Halo! An! Unbreakable! Golden! Body! Laid!Down! In! Law? Are you just picking on the son now that you’re not picking on the dad! Tianlang-Jun had only given Luo Binghe a light pat on the shoulder, but that arm broke off again. Tianlang-Jun wrinkled his brows, and Zhuzhi-Lang immediately picked it up for him, presenting it with both hands. Luo Binghe didn’t bother to wipe off all of the blood. An ominous glint flashing through his eyes, he reached to grab Xin Mo from its place on his back. Tianlang-Jun said, “The sword is a good sword. It’s a pity your technique is a hideous mess.” Luo Binghe called to Shen Qingqiu in a low voice, “Come with me!” Zhuzhi-Lang said, “It’s too late, two hundred Black Moon Rhinoceros Pythons are only enough to hold open the Holy Mausoleum’s wards for an instant, just enough to let you in.” Luo Binghe growled, “Then I’ll use you two as blood sacrifices and open it one more time!” Who could have expected, before Xin Mo completely left the sheath, it was suddenly pushed back in. He didn’t know when Tianlang-Jun had moved to stand behind Luo Binghe, pressing the sword back into the sheath with one hand, actually keeping him from drawing the sword and causing trouble. Luo Binghe reacted in a flash, turning to face the attack. Who would have thought that, no matter how fast he was, the Heart Devil sword could only be drawn three inches at the most before it was immediately pressed back down? After a few rounds of this back and forth exchange, Tianlang-Jun seemed to have lost interest in playing with him. With a flick of his wrist, he stopped minding the Heart Devil sword and went to directly push down the top of his head. Luo Binghe’s eyes snapped open. A rich cloud of purple-black energy spun around the top of his head. Tianlang-Jun lifted his hand. Giving a look at Luo Binghe’s snow-pale face, he commented impartially, “Looks like his mother.” A cold voice came from one side, “The eyes look like yours.” Tianlang-Jun slowly turned his head. Xiu Ya, glittering like frost and snow, was pressed across Zhuzhi-Lang’s neck. Shen Qingqiu smiled faintly. “This good a subordinate, this close a nephew ━ there’s nothing that’s not worthwhile. Tianlang-Jun, shouldn’t you reconsider your choices?” Zhuzhi-Lang said in a low voice, “Junshang, this subordinate had a moment of carelessness.” This ‘moment of carelessness’ was hard enough to get, Shen Qingqiu hadto spend a good amount of effort just to restrain him. Even when he wasn’t in snake form, this man was just as slippery! Tianlang-Jun said faintly, “Zhuzhi-Lang is a bit foolish, his character is very weak. If you do this to him, he’ll be broken-hearted.” Zhuzhi-lang said weakly, “Junshang, I… I didn’t…” Shen Qingqiu said, half-sincerely, “My heart is not weak at all, but I’m broken-hearted that you’re doing this to my disciple. You release my disciple, I’ll release your nephew. How about that?” Tianlang-Jun spread out his hand. “I’m just afraid I won’t be given the opportunity.” In fact, Shen Qingqiu’s palm was clammy with cold sweat, only his voice was cool and collected when he said, “I’m giving you the opportunity right now.” Tianlang-Jun said, “I mean, Zhuzhi-Lang won’t give me the opportunity.” Before his words had fallen, Zhuzhi-Lang suddenly threw himself at the point of Shen Qingqiu’s sword! He had put extraordinary strength into this movement, really going all out with no regard for his life. Shen Qingqiu never suspected it could be a temporary feint. Startling, he subconsciously withdrew his sword. Just as he pulled back the tip of his sword, Zhuzhi-Lang seized the opportunity to escape, flashing back to Tianlang-Jun’s side. Tianlang-Jun made a “see” gesture, smiling, “I told you, Zhuzhi-Lang is a bit foolish. If someone tries to blackmail me by threatening him, he’ll seek death himself. Peak Lord Shen must never underestimate him by all means.” Shen Qingqiu almost spat blood. As a hostage, Zhuzhi-Lang really had no value to speak of. Not only was he hard to pin down, after he had been seized with great difficulty there was no sense of achievement at all! Tianlang-Jun said, “Since my nephew has suffered this little grievance, it’s only fair to recoup it on Peak Lord Shen’s disciple.” While speaking, his five fingers subtly curled. Luo Binghe gave a stifled groan, fresh blood flowing from the corners of his eyes, but he still turned his gaze towards Shen Qingqiu with great difficulty. Clenching his teeth against the blood foaming from his mouth, he gritted out, “Go… anywhere is fine… just don’t stay here!” Shen Qingqiu snapped up his head, Xiu Ya flying out to the front. Like white lightning streaking across the room, it stabbed towards Tianlang-Jun. He barely tilted his head and the blade brushed past his cheek, pinning itself into amural far behind him with a clank. Tianlang-Jun said, “Your aim isn’t very good.” Shen Qingqiu slowly retracted his hand, a corner of his mouth curling up. “It’s accurate. I hit the bull’s eye.” Tianlang-Jun startled slightly, turning his head at once only to see Xiu Ya neatly pierced through the eye of a smiling woman in the mural. The gem which had been inlaid in her pupil shattered, falling from the stone wall in numerous twinkling pieces. That woman was undoubtedly just a face painted on the wall, but the corner of her mouth curved higher and higher like she was breaking into a happier smile. A corner of the grin slashed into her face split up to her ear, her bloody mouth wide open like a sacrificial bowl. Suddenly, an incomparably piercing sound of laughter erupted in the middle of the mausoleum hall. And this laughter, it was coming from the mouth of the woman painted on the wall! The Hall of Delight had anti-theft measures. The wall was full of inlaid gems, but if you try to pry one out for yourself, just wait to be laughed to death by the auditory weapon of its demon sorceress! It was clear that this laughter was especially effective against the Demon Race. After all, its main purpose was, of course, to guard against wandering tomb raiders within the Demon Race. It’s not like there were any humans who were bored enough or courageous enough to go tomb raiding in the Demon Realm. After the sound entered your ears, the heart and brains would madly pulse without end, there would be a wave of acute pain, the sky and earth spinning around you, flowers bursting in your eyes. Zhuzhi-Lang couldn’t help but cover his ears, and Tianlang-Jun also pulled away one hand to press against his temple. Shen Qingqiu was long prepared for this turn of events. Taking advantage of this split second of opportunity, he swiftly flitted across the hall. Raising his left hand, Xiu Ya responded and jumped back to its scabbard. His right hand grabbed Luo Binghe and he ran! Charging into another hall of the mausoleum, the first thing Shen Qingqiu did was to lower the sluice gate, and shut it tight! The heavy stone door crashed to the ground, stirring up a cloud of dust. He could only find the mechanism to close the door, not the one to open it. Either way, it’s best if he can’t open thedoor, but just as he was thinking this, finally able to relax after all this struggle, he turned his head to look and fell to his knees on the spot. Zhuzhi-Lang, one hand held tightly in his, blinked his eyes. What sort of disaster has he set up this time ━ he managed to leave that father-son pair currently engaged in one-sided domestic violence in the Hall of Delight. This is too big an offense; there’s going to be a criminal investigation, ah! Shen Qingqiu shook off his hand, turning to strike at the stone door, when Zhuzhi-Lang grabbed on to him again. “Master Shen, don’t bother going back. Facing Junshang, he has no chance of succeeding.” Shen Qingqiu was going to fall apart. He was that close. How could he have gotten the wrong person? It’s all because the laughing attack of the mural woman in the Hall of Delight was too strong, and in the faint twilight of flickering green candles, all three of them looked about the same at first glance in their black clothes. Was it because they were related that they all had the same sense of style? Zhuzhi-Lang said, “It’s not that you grabbed the wrong person, Master Shen, it’s that I swapped the hand you grabbed.” This was the last straw for Shen Qingqiu, and he smashed a fist into the stone door. “I wanted to be together with Luo Binghe in the first place!” Zhuzhi-Lang started, then said, “Master Shen, weren’t you and he… already together long before?” “…” With these people, it’s really hard to say! Shen Qingqiu raised a hand to signal him to shut up. Turning and walking a few steps, he suddenly felt that the floor under his feet was not entirely flat. Zhuzhi-Lang had followed him over, and he hurriedly made a gesture for him to stop. “Don’t move!” A huge woman’s face was spread across the floor of the grand hall. Right now, they were standing on its ear. It was not the same woman as the one in the Hall of Delight. This face had none of that flirtatious beauty. Instead, it was fierce and fiendish, eye sockets split in greed, with thin eyes and a broad nose. It seemed that being ugly to the point of repulsion was its forte, looking like an ugly witch. Shen Qingqiu cautioned, “Don’t step on the face.” Zhuzhi-Lang: “…” This whole floor was its face, if you can’t step on the face where would you step… Delight, Fury, Sorrow ━ these three halls were layered one after another.After passing through the first layer of the Hall of Delight, the one immediately following should be the “Hall of Fury.” When the original Luo Binghe had visited (plundered) the Holy Mausoleum and cleared this level, he had used a special step pattern to cross. Unfortunately, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t clearly remember which steps he had taken. If they carelessly misstepped, the anti-theft measures in the Hall of Fury would launch. They couldn’t get around the puzzle by flying on their swords, since passing directly above the floor would count as a step. That said, of course having your face stepped on would make you angry ━ no wonder this was the Hall of Fury! He dared to rush in here because he thought the one he had grabbed was Luo Binghe, who must have known the step pattern. But, who knew that this snake would be slippery enough to swap out people in a split second! The ground underneath their feet grew hotter and hotter. At first, the woman’s face on the ground had been scarlet, but as the temperature rose it gradually deepened to crimson. Shen Qingqiu squatted to test the temperature and immediately withdrew his hand as soon as it brushed the ground. It was hot, as if there was a fire blazing under the floor; as if even just standing on the floor would roast you like meat on a hot plate. It seems that he had already unwittingly stepped on the face a few times just now. Shen Qingqiu retreated a few steps, drawing as close to the side of the room as possible. Suddenly, a boiling-bright golden-red liquid burst from the ground like a fountain. Zhuzhi-Lang transformed into his original form in an instant, a yellow- eyed green snake coiled on the ground with scales flashing in the light. Rearing his upper body and letting out a hissing cry, he was as tall as four men. He rolled Shen Qingqiu into a ball, securely wrapped inside a layer of scaly armor. His thick forest of white fangs pressed close to Shen Qingqiu’s head. Looking at the huge golden eyes from up close, they were even more fierce and strange. Tianlang-Jun was certainly right, Zhuzhi-Lang was indeed a bit foolish. Didn’t he remember that time he was fumed up by realgar wine until he was shedding tears into the wind? And just now, didn’t he remember being held at swordpoint? In this sort of situation, he still put his heart into shielding him like this ━ it was simply making Shen Qingqiu feel sorry for picking on him. Suddenly, with a huge rumbling sound, one of the side walls of the Hall of Fury toppled over in one piece. Through the cloud of smoke pervading the air, Tianlang-Jun worked hiswrist while walking down the pile of rubble from the overturned wall. Stepping into the Hall of Fury, he said, “I don’t know if this is just my misperception, but it seems Peak Lord Shen is more familiar with the Holy Mausoleum than even me.” Zhuzhi-Lang changed back to human form, crying out, “Junshang, don’t come in!” Before Tianlang-Jun had shown a questioning expression, he had already walked six or seven steps across the woman’s face on the ground. Shen Qingqiu: “…” Zhuzhi-Lang: “…” A pillar of magma thick enough to enclose four men shot towards the sky, instantly engulfing Tianlang-Jun in a raging blaze. Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Shen Qingqiu was internally howling with laughter. See what happens when you don’t let people finish talking! Let you beat up your dear son! Go ahead and show off, even if you pretend, pride comes before the fall 216 ! But soon, he couldn’t laugh anymore. Luo Binghe staggered along close behind him, also rushing into the hall. One of his arms hung slack at his side like it had been completely broken, blood poured from his head without end, and one of his eyes wouldn’t open anymore. How cruel. This wretched a state, Luo Binghe had been beaten into an even worse state by the original goods since the last time he saw him. What is up with Luo Binghe’s constitution? Why is this elder so fond of using force to educate him? This isn’t Bai Zhan Peak! Zhuzhi-Lang ran frantic circles around that fiery pillar, too busy to care about the others. Luo Binghe carefully took in the scene in the hall and, lowering his head again to look, jumped off the pile of rubble, taking a few steps to arrive at Shen Qingqiu’s side in a flash. This isn’t scientific at all! How did he manage to know where to step to avoid triggering the mechanism at first glance? Luo Binghe seemed to have guessed what he was thinking, explaining concisely, “Step on the acupuncture points.” While speaking, the two had already crossed through the Hall of Fury, entering the next level. After the stone door was locked down, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but take two more looks at Luo Binghe to make sure he hadn’t gotten the wrong person this time. Shen Qingqiu stood at the periphery of the mausoleum hall, not daring tomake a hasty move. The demon sorceress presiding over the “Hall of Sorrow” perched at the zenith of the hall. Raising his head to look, sure enough, a woman’s face was painted on the ceiling, eyebrows drawn high and tight-knit, mellow and in deep lamentation. Sensing the presence of intruders, the face’s eyes opened. Its features twisting into motion, the expression grew increasingly miserable. First, a few drops of water seeped from its eyes and pattered to the ground, and before long, a thick drizzle floated down from the high ceiling. He was just going to call a warning not to let this ghostly rain touch their bodies when Luo Binghe raised an arm to cover him, rushing directly across with the two of them shielded that way. In one moment of inattention, Shen Qingqiu had already been dragged through this level at top speed. The original Luo Binghe walked the path of exacting technique, but this matter right now, this method is really too simple and crude! Delight, Fury, and Sorrow, these three-layered halls were a side story that dragged out for two hundred thousand words, but counting up the events just now, it wasn’t even enough for one chapter? At least the Hall of Sorrow should have been dragged out for ten chapters before it finished, but now? Was it even enough for three lines? The System chirped out a notification: Cut down on filler plot, refined storyline, B Points + 100 But this is really too much cutting! After exiting the three holy halls, there was a dark and still tomb passage. As soon as the two left the Hall of Sorrow, the green firelight gradually brightened, row after row stretching endlessly out into the distance. The anti-theft measures of the Holy Mausoleum were thorough to an insane degree, and Last Breath candles were piled up everywhere like they grew on trees. Blind drooling corpses, which had been wandering mindlessly in the tomb passage, shuffled over as they entered. With a cold and impatient look, Luo Binghe raised one hand, and they unwittingly let out a low chorus of hisses, a wheezing puff of breath filling their throats, before they retreated back into the shadows with lowered heads. Without sparing a glance at Shen Qingqiu, Luo Binghe retracted his hand and said, “Let’s go.” Shen Qingqiu noticed a fierce redness on Luo Binghe’s face, glaringly obvious under the dark green candlelight. It seemed that it was definitely not out of embarrassment. Before, every time Luo Binghe caught Shen Qingqiu, he would fix a fierce and rigid glare on him, but this time he didn’t even look.Seeing Shen Qingqiu’s gaze, he even avoided his eyes, subconsciously using his unbroken left hand to wipe away the bloodstains by his eyes. Shen Qingqiu suspected that he had been poisoned, or that he had suffered too serious a knock on the head, but Luo Binghe’s gait was still steady so it didn’t seem to be that sort of issue. He was just planning to open his mouth and ask about the situation when Luo Binghe rushed to get in his words first. “This body, are the spiritual veins working well?” Shen Qingqiu never would have anticipated this to be the first thing he said. Startling, he replied, “They’re normal.” It seemed that every time they sunk into silence, the one to take initiative and break it was Luo Binghe. He recalled that Luo Binghe had spent five years’ time restoring this body’s spiritual veins bit by bit. Luo Binghe nodded and said, “That’s good. The other body, I preserved it for a few days, but it still withered in the end. If there were also problems with this body, that would not have been good.” As soon as the soul left a body created by the Sun and Moon Dew Flower Seed, it would die at once, withering and disappearing in a moment. For Luo Binghe to have sustained it for several days, he didn’t know how much spiritual energy he had wasted on this meaningless endeavor, and he still dared to storm the Holy Mausoleum alone right afterward. Shen Qingqiu’s chest felt a bit stuffy, and he scrambled to find a topic of conversation with his thoughts in a scattered mess. Just now, Tianlang-Jun seemed to have said that Luo Binghe “brought along these two strays.” Shen Qingqiu asked, “Who else did you bring?” Luo Binghe finally gave him a glance and said, “I came alone.”"
"洛冰河昏迷之后 , 威压失去震慑力 , 方才缩进黑暗深处的盲尸们又开始蠢蠢欲动，嗬嗬嘶嘶 地围了上来。 沈清秋一手抱着歪倒的洛冰河 , 一手握住修雅剑，猛地一甩 , 剑身脱鞘飞出，势如飞矢，第 一个来回穿刺了十几只。然而雪亮的剑刃反光十分厉害，咽气烛的绿光映在剑身上 , 愈发 刺眼 , 盲尸对光线的捕捉能力极强 , 闪避也快，第二次这招就不管用了。沈清秋刚把佩剑插 回腰间，几只枯瘦的手臂已经伸到近处，甚至有一只冲洛冰河的眼球探去，他一掌甩出一 个暴击，把那只不规矩的盲尸脑袋炸开了花。 只是，暴击这招虽然好用，却不能时时用。灵力消耗太大，不多久便会弹尽粮绝，而且沈 清秋现在又回到两格电的灵力状态，不能再像之前那样无所顾忌，打出二十几发后便微觉 力不从心。盲尸在墓道中推推搡搡，他只好来一个踹飞一个，这些怪物虽然低级，却总也 打不完，还要抱着一个昏沉沉的洛冰河，踉跄之间，一时没抱牢，洛冰河脑袋又在石壁上 撞了一下。 “ 咚” 的一声，听着格外疼。沈清秋心虚地用手垫住他后脑勺，摸了又摸，总觉得似乎鼓起 了一个大包。他心下祈祷阿弥陀佛阿弥陀佛，这又烧又摔的，可千万别把孩子磕傻 了！！！ 小鬼难缠，继续留在这条布满咽气烛的墓道，只会引来源源不断的盲尸。他换了个姿势， 把洛冰河一只手扛在肩上，大步流星拖着往前走，盲尸在身后被甩出数丈，可随着他急促 的呼吸，咽气烛不断亮起，把二人身影照得无所遁形，盲尸虽然跟不上，却一直甩不掉， 穷追不舍。直到拐角处路过一间小墓室。 这也可能是一间准备室，里面棺椁横七竖八，摆的极不整齐，有的连棺盖都掀翻在地，半 点不见庄严凝重。沈清秋急忙忙拖着洛冰河进去，一口一口挨个查看，有的里面躺着姿态 奇异的枯尸，有的里面则空空如也。 墓室外嗬嘶之声越来越近，拉出长而乱的黑影在地面交错乱行。沈清秋见形势危急，跃进 石棺。他本想把洛冰河塞进另一口棺材，可没那个时间了，两个人抱作一团，齐齐翻身滚 入石棺之中。 饶是里面垫着柔软的底托，沈清秋还是摔得眼冒金星。洛冰河在上，沈清秋在下，他被沉 沉压着，险些没一口气喘不上来。 吃什么长大的这孩子！看着挺瘦怎么这么沉！ 还有半边棺盖没盖严实，沈清秋正要伸手去关，外面幽幽绿光晃动，天顶上映出数道佝偻 的黑影。 盲尸进来了。 它们缓慢地走近墓室中，不时传来轻轻的 “ 扣扣 ” 之声，还有尖锐的指甲擦刮过石棺表面的 杂音，令人毛骨悚然。 但如果说有哪个地方绝对不会藏着咽气烛，就是棺材里了。只要没有光源，这些睁眼瞎也 抓不到他们。 沈清秋不慌不忙，仰面朝天躺着，洛冰河脸朝下压在他身上，头嵌在他的肩窝上，热量传 到沈清秋脖子上，烫得人难受。 连他都难受，洛冰河自然更难受。刚好洛冰河手冰头热，不如用他的手给额头降个温。沈 清秋觉得这是个好主意，正想抓着洛冰河的腕子举起来，忽然身体一僵。 五根枯皮包骨、指甲奇长的手指出现在棺材上方。 为什么会搜查的这么仔细彻底！！！不是说盲尸智商很低的吗！！！不是发光的东西人家 根本不想理的好吗！！！ 沈清秋突然发现，他脸旁的确有个东西在发出淡淡的红光。 斜眼一看，洛冰河虽然眼睛闭着，可额头上的天魔印已经化出来了，额头间赤红的纹印正 随着他的呼吸明明灭灭。红光随之一黯一亮。 这玩意儿是啥！难道是类似于每次奥特曼打小怪兽时最后关头都要闪巴闪巴的玩意儿吗？ 他两手都被洛冰河压住，抽不出来捂住那枚坏事的印记，下意识猛一转头，唇角压住了那 片光洁的额头。 看上去 …… 好像有点像在亲洛冰河的额头。不要在意这种细节，保命要紧！ 那只枯瘦伶仃、指甲里塞满污垢、还缠着几缕发丝的手颤颤悠悠探进石棺来，四下摸索 着。 这棺材内部空间狭窄，可棺肚深长，只要它继续保持这个摸索范围，还是碰不到棺底的两 人。但这只手却分毫不知收敛，越探越深。沈清秋心跟着他越吊越高，眼看就快碰到洛冰 河的背部，他一咬牙，抽出一只快被压麻的右手，在洛冰河背后找了一片还算完好的地方 ，按了下来。 这么一按，洛冰河的上身和他彻底贴到了一起。原先还有缝隙可寻，现在，两个人几乎嵌 成了一团，胸膛贴胸膛，小腹贴小腹。 本来，小腹应该是人体最柔软的部位，沈清秋肚子却被洛冰河的小腹硌得慌，越往下压， 越确信他肯定练了八块腹肌，硬得硌死人。 那只手虽然在洛冰河背部上方毫厘之处停住了，却改了方向，另一侧摸去。 眼看着又要摸到洛冰河小腿，沈清秋把心一横，把腿分开，让洛冰河左腿落入他双腿中 间。 已经把两人所占空间压缩到最小了，真的不能再小了！ 那只盲尸哆哆嗦嗦摸了半天，什么都没摸到，慢吞吞抽了出去。 等到盲尸们咕噜咕噜不满地退出墓室，成群结队游荡得远了，沈清秋才松了口气。 现在这个姿势太难看、太不堪入目了 …… 要是有人伸头过来往里一看，保准觉得沈清秋牢 牢抱着洛冰河不肯撒手，拼了命地在把他往怀里塞。 他刚想扶着洛冰河坐起，墓室内忽然突兀地响起一个声音。 “ 现在就放下心，未免为时过早了。 ” 这声音苍老，语气嘲讽。沈清秋立即抓起修雅剑，翻了个身，把洛冰河压在下面，自己坐 起，横剑在前，全神戒备： “ 谁！ ” 盲尸群早已远去，这墓室空荡荡的，只有满屋冷冰冰的石棺。 …… 别告诉他是哪具棺材里的又诈尸了！他刚才看过了，差不多全是干货啊！ 那声音又道： “ 老夫若不想让你看到，你即便翻过整个圣陵，也别想看到。 ” 听了两句，沈清秋发觉，这声音很熟悉，他绝对在哪里听过。而且不只一句。 灵光一闪，他把剑插回鞘中，道： “ 既然是梦魔前辈，也不必装神弄鬼了。 ” 话音刚落，一个老者蓦地出现在墓室中央，衣着华贵，目如鹰隼。 他盘坐在一具石棺上，傲然俯视沈清秋： “ 你倒也还记得老夫。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 自然记得。梦魔前辈既然出现在我面前，那我现在一定是在做梦了。 ” 梦魔之前一只能以一团黑雾的形象出现在梦境中，现在却可以化出人形了。看来借洛冰河 的躯体恢复得很不错。 见来者是他，沈清秋反倒放了心。梦魔是绝对站在洛冰河这一方的，他既然出现，至少不 会害洛冰河。 梦魔哼道： “ 可你二人眼下困境，却不是在做梦。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 能否请梦魔前辈相助，进入洛冰河梦境中，将他唤醒？ ” 梦魔道： “ 唤不醒。 ” 沈清秋诧异： “ 为什么？ ” 难道洛冰河的脑子已经烧坏了？ 梦魔淡淡地道： “ 进不去。这小子现在元神混沌，一片虚无，迷雾重重，堕梦不醒。老夫 以往只在两种人的梦境中遇到过这种情况。其中一种，是重病临危之人。 ” 看来不是要讲什么好话。沈清秋耐心问道： “ 第二种？ ” “ 痴傻之人。 ” 沈清秋握着修雅剑的手紧了紧。 梦魔自顾自道： “ 也是这小子活该。过往五年，白日耗费精气神招魂，夜里胡乱残杀自己 的梦境造物。老夫早就教导过他，这么做无异于自毁元神，他不理会。迟早会有这么一 天。近七天为保存你肉身，灵力耗损，那魔剑更伺机作乱。何况他还硬闯圣陵，和本族历 代天赋最高的天魔血系传人正面对上。 ” 沈清秋喉咙发干，回头看了一眼躺在石棺中不省人事的洛冰河，道： “…… 前辈也没办法 唤醒他？ ” “ 束手无策。 ” 沈清秋冲他一抱拳，默默躺回棺材里。 梦魔： “……” 他竖眉道： “ 你在干什么？ ” 沈清秋答： “ 睡觉。等睡醒。 ” 梦魔额头青筋暴起： “ 你敢无视老夫？ ” 沈清秋闭着眼睛： “ 既然前辈都说了束手无策，当然只能等我自己醒来护他出去了。 ” 梦魔哼道： “ 本族圣陵禁地凶险重重，还有两个麻烦角色在等着，凭你一人，护不住他。 ” 他这话很对，非常对。 可现在除了他，还有谁能护、或者说会护住洛冰河的？ 沈清秋睁眼，叹了口气： “ 保不住也要保。怎么说也是我徒弟。 ” 坑了洛冰河这么久，沈清秋心烦意乱，不知到底什么感觉，但有一点很明确：说什么也不 能让洛冰河交待在这里。 梦魔冷冷道： “ 时隔多年，你总算肯再承认这小子是你徒弟了？ ” 沈清秋赞同道： “ 的确是隔了很久。 ” 他还等着梦魔继续阴阳怪气开嘲讽，那老者却忽然叹了口气， 他道： “ 要是这小子能醒过来，听到你这句话，不知道该有多欢喜。 ” 大爷，您能不能不要每句都这么晦气！ 沈清秋满脸黑线。什么叫 “ 要是 ”“ 能醒过来 ” ，这种生死难测语气搞得他也越发心里不安了 好吗！ 梦魔忽然怒气上涌，大声喝道： “ 明明我才是这小子的师父，教了他多少东西？！啊？！ 通天彻地之能，操纵人心之术！可他就是不肯叫我一声师父， ‘ 前辈 ’ 、 ‘ 前辈 ’ 的挂在嘴 边！你这凡修不过是教了他一些粗浅拳脚毛糙心法，他却追在你后面哭着喊着叫师尊！真 是气煞老夫也！ ” 他很早就憋了一肚子气，眼下看到这两个人躺在同一具棺材里，越发觉得画面刺眼，老眼 要瞎，极不痛快，大发牢骚。 沈清秋也不痛快，苍穹山派的剑法是粗浅拳脚？！ 他呵呵道： “ 我是他人生导师。 ” 系统认证，洛冰河人生观世界观价值观都受他影响 √ 梦魔却道： “ 你也知道？那你为何这么多年来能狠心弃他不顾？ ” 沈清秋又噎住了。从洛冰河的角度来看，这句质问好像没啥不对的地方。 梦魔吹胡子瞪眼道： “ 若是当年在梦境中，神不知鬼不觉将你除去，今日也就不会生出这 些事端。 ” 他在石棺上负手走来走去，暴躁道： “ 这小子本来是个大有前途的可塑之才，可 一遇到你就这般窝囊，婆婆妈妈，哭哭啼啼，偏偏还要在你面前装模作样，故作冷酷！照 老夫说，要么就把你给办了，要么就把你给杀了，这般折腾闹腾，欲拒还迎欲说还休，让 人看了忒也生气！！ ” 沈清秋真恨不得捂住耳朵，或者缝住他嘴。 梦魔真烦啊！！！当着本人把这种事情讲出来，真的好吗？！ 他瞥了身旁洛冰河安静睡着的脸一眼，脑中闪过一瞬他哭哭啼啼的样子 …… 呃，立刻撤回 目光，脸颊像有点发烫，肯定是错觉！ 沈清秋忍无可忍： “ 前辈能让我醒了吗？ ” 梦魔还有怨气： “ 醒？醒了你也不知道该怎么出去。 ” 沈清秋： “ 我当然知道。请前辈告诉我洛冰河用黑月蟒犀破界是在哪个方向。 ” 梦魔道： “ 打开的入口已经闭合了。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 未必不能再打开。 ” 他目光落在洛冰河腰间的心魔剑上。刚被打开一次的入口必然尚显薄弱，再用心魔剑使一 次劈空斩，说不定能再度开启！ 梦魔顺着他目光看去，心中了然，却不以为意： “ 此剑未必肯为你所用。 ” 这点他当然也知道。沈清秋暗暗咬牙，沉声说： “ 没别的办法了。总要一试。 ” 醒来时，他还躺在石棺之中，洛冰河也乖乖压在他身上，被抱得严严实实。 谢天谢地，总算梦魔那磨人的老妖精肯放他出来了！ 沈清秋正要一骨碌坐起，忽然，右腿似乎蹭到了什么东西，在他大腿根内侧硬呼呼的戳了 戳。 沈清秋先以为是剑柄，心不在焉伸手去拨，刚碰到，系统消息陡然炸开： 【爽度 +1000 ┏ ( ┏ ^q^) ┓ ~~~ 恭喜取得成就 “* 关系进展 ” ！！！】 一刹那，沈清秋僵成了一条干货。 “* 关系进展 ” ？是个毛玩意儿？ 他再低头看看。这 “ 剑柄 ” 可真是个了不得的东西。 天柱啊！！！！！！！！！！！是天柱啊！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！ 沈清秋杀人然后再自杀的心都有了！ 风中缭乱狂舞了半晌，他啪的一掌拍在脸上，心中安慰自己：圣陵里不分日月，可能现在 外面正是早晨呢？！正常现象，正常的生理现象！ 它会自己消掉的吧？！一般来说都是这样的没错！ 但这样放着不管，好像也太可怜了！！！ 可怜也没办法，总不能在这种情况下帮他撸吧？！？！？！ 假装没看到应该能被原谅的对不对？！？！？！ 对啊！说到底，做师父根本没有义务帮徒弟消火啊、就算火是他蹭出来的也一样！！！ 沈清秋把洛冰河猛地推起来，一掌拍在胸口，送了几波灵力进去。虽然不多，可现在他也 输出不了更多了，能输多少是多少。 其余的东西，一概无视！无视！ 出了石棺，一路拖拖拉拉，拽着洛冰河往梦魔所指的 “ 正东方尽头 ” 走去。走了一阵，墓道 四壁开始变得潮湿，脚底生滑，青苔重重，要站稳越发不易。沈清秋放慢了速度，避免滑 倒。 继续走，不止青苔，杂草花丛也冒了出来，墓道逐渐开阔，两侧高矮不一的树木拔地而起 ，地面不止湿滑，还有老树根盘虬纠结，不时绊一绊腿。飞虫掠过，鸟语声声。蓝黑的天 顶陡然拔高，镶嵌其上的晶白石粒闪闪烁烁，乍看好似夜空星幕。 虽然看上去有置身丛林的错觉，可他们并没有走出圣陵，只是来到了圣陵内部一间特殊的 墓室。 圣陵中每间墓室，都是历代魔族贵族在生前为自己设计的。千奇百怪，五花八门。就像一 座公寓，住户搬入，人手一套毛坯，剩下的当然就是按照自己的喜好装修布置房子。擅长 机关的，就会偏重奇门遁甲。熟悉魔兽的，就会豢养守陵怪物。擅长药草的，则会种满毒 花异草。 这间墓室的主人，显然就是最后一种。别看这些树花草木平凡无奇，沈清秋绝对不想沾 身。 他解下外衣，罩在两人头上，紧了紧搂着洛冰河腰部的手，谨慎地迈出步去。 草叶簌簌而动。 突然，尖锐的破空声挟着一道寒白的冷光射来。 沈清秋左手打个响指，腰间修雅剑应声出鞘，铛的一声与飞袭而来的冷剑交成十字。那边 还没解决，第二道白光旋即而至。这次竟是直接朝洛冰河的喉咙刺来。修雅剑正挡着第一 把剑，无法召回，更不能扔开洛冰河，万一碰到那些花草就完蛋了！ 情急之下，沈清秋微微错身，一抬手臂，赤手抓住了剑锋。 剑刃深深豁开手掌心，可被他牢牢握住，硬是没再前进半寸。鲜血不是滴落，而是泼落， 沈清秋半边衣衫和地上碧草瞬间覆上一层艳红色。 他终于发现，直接用手去抓白刃，是一件多疼的事了。 血光染红了沈清秋的眼，他猛地抬头，瞳孔骤缩。 真是万万没想到，天琅君口里的 “ 小鱼 ” ，居然指的是这两个人。","CHAPTER 59: ICE DISAPPEARS, SNOW MELTS After a pause, he continued, “Those two people from just then aren’t easy to deal with. Even if Shizun doesn’t want to stay at my place, I still hope that you will not go with them.” It sounded as if this wasn’t the first time Luo Binghe had run into the two of them. Shen Qingqiu said, “Have you met them before?” Luo Binghe said indifferently, “I’ve met that snake at Nan Jiang before. We exchanged a few blows and I almost lost. I’ve never seen the other one before, but I cannot defeat him.” Zhuzhi-Lang was born in Nan Jiang, so if someone ran around over there, they would naturally have to be a little more diligent. Tianlang-Jun also said before that the original purpose of the plague at Jinlan City was to resolve the food shortage at Nan Jiang. It was to be expected that Luo Binghe got in a few fights with Zhuzhi-Lang at Nan Jiang. But Zhuzhi-Lang didn’t seem to have told Luo Binghe what his identity was and didn’t treat Luo Binghe as his young master. It didn’t look like Tianlang-Jun had any intention of telling him either. Judging from this, neither father nor cousin had any intent to acknowledge him. Even though Luo Binghe’s pace was steady, he was still limping very faintly. However, he continued to walk with a straight back, not even supporting himself with the wall. When Shen Qingqiu saw this, he was full of mixed feelings, and he awkwardly hesitated for a moment before he suddenly hardened his resolve and took a step forward. He was about to go support Luo Binghe when the candlelight suddenly flickered. The tomb passage dimmed a little, and Luo Binghe’s body pressed towards him. But this time, Luo Binghe didn’t forcefully hug him, nor did he grope around. Instead, he completely toppled onto Shen Qingqiu before he stopped moving at all. After being tossed around for half a day, Shen Qingqiu was also feeling extremely exhausted. He couldn’t bear the weight of two people, and he fell against the wall with a thud. Luo Binghe was slumped on top of him, soft and boneless, and his head knocked against the wall, creating a resounding noise upon impact. When Shen Qingqiu heard that, his heart also jumped along with it, his teeth aching.He hastily stood up straight and held Luo Binghe. After fumbling around for a bit, he managed to reach behind him. The clothes on Luo Binghe’s back, which had been drenched by the ghostly rain in the Hall of Sorrow, were tattered. He probed inside of his clothing. The skin underneath his fingers felt strange as if there were marks of festering. It had also already started to emit a fishy scent. After all, the ghostly rain wasn’t anything good. If nobody else was present, the way Shen Qingqiu liked to wake other people up was to first go up and give them a small slap on either side of their face. But now, he hadn’t even reached out a hand yet when he felt like he couldn’t do it, so as a result, he changed it to lightly patting Luo Binghe’s cheek a few times. His voice also involuntarily softened. “Luo Binghe? Luo Binghe?” Luo Binghe’s eyes were closed heavily. His eyelashes didn’t even flutter, and the color of his face grew increasingly and abnormally red. Shen Qingqiu reached out a hand and touched him. His forehead and cheeks were both scalding hot like he had a fever. But there was no way that the concept of a ‘fever’ would exist in Luo Binghe’s body. Even if there were times when he would occasionally find himself in tough situations, it wouldn’t last for very long, and it especially wouldn’t reach the point where he lost consciousness. Shen Qingqiu touched his hands, but they were ice cold. It was as if Luo Binghe’s head was in the microwave and his body was in the freezer. Shen Qingqiu placed a hand behind Luo Binghe’s head and massaged the area that had just knocked against the wall. “Binghe, can you hear me?” No response. Shen Qingqiu calculated a little. In order to protect his flesh body and not let it rot, Luo Binghe had used up several days’ worth of spiritual energy, and in the end he still hadn’t been able to protect it; he went through great pains running around blindly to catch Black Moon Rhinoceros Pythons; after arriving at the Holy Mausoleum, he was first beaten up by Tianlang-Jun, then attacked head-on by the sound waves in the Hall of Delight, continued to be beaten up by Tianlang-Jun, before he was finally drenched by the ghostly rain. No matter how you thought about it, it should be much more serious than getting a fever. After Luo Binghe passed out, his oppressive aura lost its ability to intimidate. The Blind Corpses that had shrunk into the darkness just then started to stir restlessly again, hissing as they surrounded them.Shen Qingqiu held Luo Binghe, who had toppled over, with one hand, while he gripped the Xiu Ya sword with the other. With a violent shake, the sword flew out from its sheath like a flying arrow and immediately pierced through more than a dozen of them. However, the dazzling blade of the sword reflected light extremely intensely. When the green light from the Last Breath Candles reflected against the sword, it grew even harsher. The Blind Corpses were very skilled at chasing after the light and also dodged quickly, so if he tried the same thing again, it wouldn’t work. Shen Qingqiu had just sheathed his sword and returned it to his waist when several withered hands already reached near him. There was even one that stretched straight for Luo Binghe’s eyes. Shen Qingqiu sent out an explosive blow with his palm, making the insolent Blind Corpse’s head explode. However, even though explosive blows were easy to use, he couldn’t use them constantly. It used up too much spiritual energy, and he would run out after a while. Moreover, Shen Qingqiu was back in the mode where he only had two bars’ worth of spiritual energy so he couldn’t be worry-free like he had been before. After sending out twenty or so blows, he started to feel weaker than he would’ve liked. The Blind Corpses pushed and shoved in the tomb passage, and he had no choice but to kick each one away as they came. Even though these monsters were low level, there was never an end to them, and he still had to hold onto an unconscious Luo Binghe. He stumbled once and momentarily failed to hold him steady, causing Luo Binghe’s head to knock against the wall once more. The ‘bang’ sounded extremely painful. Troubled, Shen Qingqiu used his hand to cushion Luo Binghe’s head. He felt around again, and he couldn’t help but feel as if a large bump had swollen up. Shen Qingqiu better not knock this child’s head so hard that he ends up with brain problems, with this fever and being thrown around! Small demons were troublesome. If they continued to stay in this tomb passage that was full of Last Breath Candles, they would only attract an unending stream of Blind Corpses. He changed positions and lifted one of Luo Binghe’s arms over his shoulder, hauling him forward with large strides. The Blind Corpses were flung several meters behind, but the Last Breath Candles continued to light up with his urgent breaths, illuminating their shadows so that there was nowhere to hide. Even though the Blind Corpses couldn’t catch up, he couldn’t shake them off either as they continued to pursue him and Luo Binghe relentlessly, all the way up until he turned a corner and passed a small tombroom. This was most likely also a preparation room. The coffins inside were strewn about extremely messily, and the covers on some of them were even overturned onto the ground. It didn’t seem dignified or noble at all. Shen Qingqiu hastily dragged Luo Binghe inside, checking each one in turn. Some had dried corpses lying in strange positions inside, but there were also some that were completely empty. The wheezing noises from outside the tomb room grew closer and closer, and the elongated and messy shadows on the floor intertwined chaotically. Shen Qingqiu saw that the situation was desperate and jumped inside a stone coffin. He originally wanted to stuff Luo Binghe inside a different coffin, but he didn’t have time for that anymore. Hugging Luo Binghe tightly, Shen Qingqiu flipped the two of them over and they tumbled simultaneously into a stone coffin. Even though there was something soft cushioning the bottom, Shen Qingqiu still landed so hard that he saw stars. Luo Binghe was on top, Shen Qingqiu on the bottom. He was squashed heavily, and he nearly couldn’t catch his breath. What did this child eat while growing up! He looked fairly skinny, so why was he so heavy! Half of the coffin lid wasn’t sealed properly. Shen Qingqiu was about to reach out a hand to close it when the faint green light from outside swayed and numerous crooked shadows reflected against the ceiling. The Blind Corpses had come inside. They walked slowly into the tomb room. The occasional sound of light knocking floated over, as well as the noise made from sharp fingernails scratching across the surface of the stone coffins, making Shen Qingqiu’s blood run cold. But if there was one place that Last Breath Candles absolutely wouldn’t be hidden in, it was in a coffin. As long as there wasn’t a source of light, these blind creatures wouldn’t be able to catch them. Shen Qingqiu remained calm, lying on his back. Luo Binghe pressed down on top of him, face-down, his head buried in the hollow of Shen Qingqiu’s shoulder. The heat spread onto Shen Qingqiu’s neck, so hot that it was uncomfortable. Even he felt uncomfortable, so Luo Binghe must naturally be even more uncomfortable. Luckily Luo Binghe’s hands were cold and his head was hot. He might as well use his own hand to lower the temperature of his forehead. Shen Qingqiuthought that this was a good idea, and he was about to grab Luo Binghe’s wrist and lift it up when his body suddenly stiffened. Five withered, bony fingers with oddly long fingernails appeared above the coffin. Why did they have to search so carefully and thoroughly! Weren’t the Blind Corpses supposed to have very low IQs! Didn’t they simply ignore everything that didn’t emit light! Shen Qingqiu suddenly discovered that there actually was something emitting a faint red light next to his cheek. He glanced to the side. Even though Luo Binghe’s eyes were closed, the Demonic Mark on his forehead had already materialized. The scarlet pattern on his forehead was currently brightening and fading in time with his breathing. The red light subsequently dimmed and glowed. Even though he knew that this mark was the symbol of Luo Binghe’s bloodline, it didn’t have to shine so conspicuously, did it! Why did it look so similar to how Ultraman 217 would start to flash light every time he reached the last critical moment while fighting a monster and didn’t have enough energy left! He couldn’t free his hand to cover that disastrous mark. He subconsciously turned his head abruptly and pressed his lips against Luo Binghe’s bright and clean forehead. It actually looked sort of like he was kissing Luo Binghe’s forehead. However, there was no need to care about such trivial details during unusual circumstances like this! Their lives were more important! That withered and dried hand, with fingernails full of filth and several strands of hair wrapped around it, trembled as it slowly reached into the stone coffin, groping around. The space inside the coffin was narrow, but it was very deep. As long as the Blind Corpse continued to maintain this range while fumbling around, it still wouldn’t be able to touch the two people at the bottom. But this hand didn’t retreat in the slightest. As its hand moved lower and lower, Shen Qingqiu grew tenser and tenser. It was about to touch Luo Binghe’s back when Shen Qingqiu gritted his teeth and extracted his right hand, which had almost gone numb, and pressed down on an area of Luo Binghe’s back that was still fairly intact. With this push, Luo Binghe’s upper half pressed completely against him. Originally, there was still a small space between them, but now the two of them were basically one person, chest against chest, stomach against stomach.The stomach should naturally be the human body’s softest area, but Luo Binghe’s abdomen jabbed terribly hard into Shen Qingqiu’s. The more he pressed down, the more he was convinced that Luo Binghe definitely had an eight pack. It was hard enough to kill someone. Even though the hand stopped a hair away from Luo Binghe’s back, it changed direction instead and started moving to the side. When Shen Qingqiu saw that it was about to touch Luo Binghe’s calf, he hardened his heart and parted his legs, allowing Luo Binghe’s left leg to land between his. He had already compressed the space that they took up to its absolute minimum, he really couldn’t compress it any further! The Blind Corpse shakily felt around for a long while. It didn’t touch anything, and it withdrew very slowly. Shen Qingqiu only released a breath of relief when the Blind Corpses left the tomb room, grumbling with dissatisfaction, and the entire crowd wandered away. Their position right now was truly too unseemly. If someone poked their head over and saw them, they would think that Shen Qingqiu was someone burning with desire for sure, holding onto Luo Binghe firmly without any intention of letting go like he was doing all he could to squeeze him into his embrace. He was about to support Luo Binghe and sit up when a voice suddenly resounded inside the tomb room. “Relaxing so early, isn’t this really much too soon.” The voice was elderly, its tone sneering. Shen Qingqiu immediately picked up the Xiu Ya sword and flipped over, pressing Luo Binghe beneath him. He sat up, holding his sword in front of him, full of wariness. “Who!” The Blind Corpses had already long since gone far away. The tomb room was completely empty, full of nothing but ice cold stone coffins. … don’t tell him it was another reanimated corpse from some coffin. He just checked ━ they were basically all dried corpses! The voice spoke again. “If I don’t want you to see me, then you don’t have any hope of seeing me even if you overturn the entire Holy Mausoleum.” When Shen Qingqiu heard that, he felt that this voice was very familiar. He had definitely heard it somewhere before, and not just once. With a flash of spiritual light, he sheathed his sword and said, “Since it’s just the Dream Demon Elder, there’s no need to put on a show.” He had just finished speaking when an old man suddenly appeared in themiddle of the room in luxurious clothing, his eyes like that of a hawk. He sat cross-legged on top of a coffin and looked down loftily at Shen Qingqiu. “You actually still remember me.” Shen Qingqiu: “Since the Dream Demon Elder has appeared in front of me, then I must be dreaming right now.” Before, the Dream Demon could only appear as a ball of black fog in the dreamscape, but now, he could transform into a human shape. It seemed like he had recovered quite well after borrowing Luo Binghe’s body. When Shen Qingqiu saw that the newcomer was an old gramps who would definitely stand on Luo Binghe’s side, he actually relaxed. The Dream Demon sniffed. “However, the predicament that you two are in right now isn’t a dream.” Shen Qingqiu: “Is it possible to request the Dream Demon Elder’s assistance in entering Luo Binghe’s dreamscape and waking him?” The Dream Demon said, “I cannot wake him.” “Ah?” Shen Qingqiu grew a little panicked and he nearly blurted out, “Why not!” Was Luo Binghe’s brain already damaged from the fever? The Dream Demon said indifferently, “I can’t enter. This brat’s primordial spirit is currently in chaos. It’s completely blank with layers of heavy fog, and he’s fallen into a dream that he cannot wake from. I’ve only ever encountered this kind of situation in two types of people’s dreams before. One of them were those who were on the brink of death from serious illness.” It seemed like he wasn’t about to say something good. But if the first kind was already on the brink of death from serious illness, the second kind couldn’t be even worse. Shen Qingqiu asked patiently, “Then the other type?” “The intellectually disabled.” “…” The Dream Demon rambled, “Serves this brat right. In the past five years, he wastes his energy summoning the soul all day long and recklessly slaughters his own creations in his dreamscape at night. I’ve long since instructed him that doing so would be the same thing as destroying his own primordial spirit. Sooner or later, this day would come. In order to preserve your flesh Seed body during these past few days, he wasted his spiritual energy, and that demon sword was just waiting for an opportunity to revolt. What’s more, he forcefully broke into the Holy Mausoleum, and faced off directly against the most gifted descendant that the demon race has seen for generations.” Shen Qingqiu gripped Xiu Ya sword so tightly that it hurt. He looked backat Luo Binghe, who was lying unconscious in the coffin, and said, “Elder has no way of awakening him either?” “I cannot do anything.” Shen Qingqiu cupped his hands in respect towards him and laid silently back down in the coffin. The Dream Demon lifted an eyebrow. “What are you doing?” Shen Qingqiu answered, “Sleeping. Until I wake up.” The veins in the Dream Demon’s head bulged. “You dare to ignore me?” Shen Qingqiu closed his eyes. “Since Elder already said that he cannot do anything, of course, I can only wait until I can wake up and safely send him out.” The Dream Demon snorted. “My clan’s forbidden area, the Holy Mausoleum, is extremely dangerous. There are also two troublesome characters waiting for you. You alone cannot protect him.” That was true, very true. Shen Qingqiu opened his eyes and sighed. “But right now, besides me, his Shizun, who else can protect ━ or should I say, will protect Luo Binghe?” Chaotic emotions came thick and fast. Shen Qingqiu’s thoughts were in turmoil, but he was very clear about one thing: no matter what, he couldn’t leave Luo Binghe to die here. The Dream Demon said coldly, “After so many years, you’re finally willing to acknowledge once more that this brat is your disciple and that you are his Shizun?” Shen Qingqiu: “It has indeed been a very long time.” He was still waiting for the Dream Demon to continue ridiculing him mysteriously, but that old man suddenly gave a sigh. He said, “If this brat could wake up and hear what you just said, I wonder how happy he would be.” Gramps, can you not talk so gloomily with every sentence! Shen Qingqiu’s face was full of black lines. What did he mean, “if he could wake up”? This kind of uncertain-about-life-or-death tone just made him even more uneasy, okay! The Dream Demon’s anger suddenly surged up, and he shouted loudly, “I’m clearly this brat’s Shifu, how many things have I taught him? Ah? The ability to know everything under the sky, the method to control people’s hearts! But he refuses to call me Shifu; all he ever says is ‘Elder,’ ‘Elder’! You’re just some average cultivator that taught him a few superficial fighting moves and one or two coarse mental cultivation methods, yet he chases after you crying andcalling for Shizun! It’s infuriating!” He had long since suppressed his anger, and now when he saw the two of them lying in the same coffin, he found the scene more and more offensive. His old eyes were about to go blind from it, and he was extremely unhappy, so he was very grouchy. Shen Qingqiu wasn’t happy either. He was irritated just from the Dream Demon calling Cang Qiong Mountain’s sword techniques superficial fighting moves. He was about to fight back when the Dream Demon started to walk back and forth across the coffin, hands behind his back, saying with agitation, “If I had secretly eliminated you back then in the dreamscape, this kind of incident wouldn’t have happened today. This brat was originally a talent with great prospects ahead of him, but the moment he met you he became this good-for-nothing that only makes people angry. He stubbornly continues to put on an act in front of you too, pretending not to feel anything! If it were up to me, he should either just kill you or do you. Putting up such a fuss, wavering in between ━ it really makes someone mad when they see it!” Shen Qingqiu really wanted to just cover his ears and seal the other’s mouth. He glanced at Luo Binghe’s peacefully sleeping face, and an image of Luo Binghe crying flashed across his mind briefly before he immediately looked away. He couldn’t help but say, “It isn’t very good to say this kind of thing in front of me, Elder, is it? Are you done scolding now? If you are, can you let me wake up?” The Dream Demon still had grievances. “Wake up? Even if you wake up you don’t know how to get out. The entrance that he opened has already closed.” Shen Qingqiu: “Why can’t I just open it again? May I please request that Elder tells me what direction to go in to get to where Luo Binghe broke through the barrier using the Black Moon Rhinoceros Pythons.” His gaze landed on the Heart Devil sword at Luo Binghe’s waist. The entrance that had just been opened up would inevitably still be weak. If he used the Xin Mo sword to slice through it again, perhaps he could open it again once more. The Dream Demon followed his gaze. He clearly understood but wasn’t convinced. “This sword may not necessarily allow you to use it.” Of course, Shen Qingqiu also knew this. He silently clenched his teeth and said heavily, “There’s no other choice. I still have to try.” When he woke up, he was still lying in the stone coffin, and Luo Binghe was also still lying obediently on top of him, held tightly against him. Thank heavens, that bothersome old Dream Demon spirit finally agreed to let him go. Shen Qingqiu was about to sit up in a single movement when hisright leg suddenly seemed to brush against something that poked stiffly into his inner thigh. Shen Qingqiu thought it was a sword hilt at first and absent-mindedly stretched out a hand to go push it aside. He had just touched it when the System’s announcement suddenly exploded: YOOOOOOO~~Cool points +1000 ┏ ( ┏ ^q^) ┓ ~ Congratulations for obtaining the achievement “Physical Relationship Development”! Immediately, Shen Qingqiu’s body also stiffened into a dried corpse. “Physical Relationship Development”? The hell was that? He looked down again. Only then did he find out that this “sword hilt” was truly something remarkable. Sky pillar 218 ! It was the sky pillar ah! Shen Qingqiu wanted to kill somebody and then kill himself! After flailing around in confusion for a while, he slapped a hand against his face, comforting himself in his mind: there was no distinguishing between day or night in the Holy Mausoleum, so maybe it was morning outside right now? It was a regular phenomenon, a regular physiological phenomenon! It would go away on its own right? Generally speaking, that’s how things worked! But ignoring it like this also seemed too pitiful! Even if it was pitiful, nothing could be done. It’s not like he could help him rub it in this kind of circumstance, right?? If he pretended like he didn’t see it, he should be forgiven, right???"
"虬结粗壮的老树之后，走出两个人来来。 准确的说 , 只走出了一个人 , 另外一个 , 被推在一只类似轮椅的小车上。 站着的是个腰肢纤细、凹凸有致的美貌女子。被推着的虽然坐在椅车上 , 颈部以下都裹在 一条粗毡毛毯里，但露出的那颗头沈清秋却十分熟悉。 那柄剑还在前进，沈清秋不得不抓紧了它 , 用力之大 , 剑刃几乎要切下他半个手掌。 他脸上表情一成不变 , 假笑道： “ 秋姑娘 , 老宫主 , 别来无恙。 ” 秋海棠目光怨愤。老宫主的头动了动 , 声音嘶哑： “ 沈峰主看我这像是无恙么？ ” 也就是说说走个过场而已。沈清秋干笑一声。 仔细观察，他发现， “ 无恙 ” 这个词，真的不适合用在此时。从前的老宫主是得道仙家一般 的人物，无论仙盟大会初见，还是金兰城不欢而散，外表仪态，都是丝毫不坠。可现在的 老宫主，从来一丝不苟的雪白胡子变得污垢纠结，面容更是苍老了不少，皱纹堆积比他身 后的老树枯皮还密。 老宫主语音森然： “ 你一定很奇怪，为什么我变成了这个样子。 ” 沈清秋心想我能说不奇怪然后你可以放我过去么？嘴上却说： “ 在下听闻老宫主归隐云游 去了。 ” 老宫主嘿嘿道： “ 归隐云游？究竟是怎么回事，这就要问你的好徒弟了。 ” 虽然不知道具体怎么回事，但看来是找洛冰河算账的。 沈清秋不动声色，把洛冰河往身后掖了掖，尽数挡住。 秋海棠恨恨道： “ 沈九，我早就说过，你化成灰我也认得出来。我早就知道花月城你自爆 的事肯定有诈，自裁谢罪？呵呵，你怎么会是那种人？在那魔界妖女的地盘我一眼便瞧了 出来，你果然没死！ ” 你认出的只是我的 * ，没有认出我的灵魂，有什么用啊 …… 沈清秋无奈。 当日在纱华铃的赤云窟被擒时，沈清秋救各派人士出来，只和她见了短短一面，居然就引 起了怀疑。他重回苍穹山派，被洛冰河带走之后，秋海棠也穿越了边境之地，跟着一路来 到魔界。洛冰河大量抓捕黑月蟒犀破除圣陵结界，必然焦头烂额，心神紊乱，无暇防备， 竟然没注意到有人跟着偷偷混了进来。总结：女人的仇恨真是不能小觑。 只是这两个人的组合，沈清秋还真从没想过，也不知道他们什么时候搭上线的。 想到这里，沈清秋忽然明白了： “ 当初秋姑娘忽然出现在金兰城，这里面也有老宫主的一 份功劳吧？ ” 既然竹枝郎已经否认是他所为，那就是别人在推波助澜了。否则凭秋海棠所在的杂门杂派 ，哪有机会抢到前沿。 老宫主冷冷一笑，不答话，也没否认。 空气中漂浮着蒲公英种子一般细小的白絮，晃晃悠悠，飞过眼前去。沈清秋道： “ 沈某自 问不曾得罪过老宫主 ……” 老宫主道： “ 事到如今，也不必隐瞒。 ” 他嗓子喑哑，仿佛有一块痰堵在喉咙里： “ 当初洛冰河入我幻花宫，我悉心栽培，有意扶 持，他却执意不肯拜我为师，更不肯娶我女儿，偏偏对你念念不忘。我自然要对沈峰主好 好探查一番，看看究竟是个什么样的人物。谁知倒让我查出不少陈年旧事。对你的底细， 我一清二楚。你师从何人，做过哪些事，究竟如何拜入苍穹山派门下，真是精彩得很。即 便是没有撒种人这一桩，水牢你也是去定了。谁知另有其变，倒没让我费心。 ” 这么说，当年幻花宫弟子对他态度奇差，不是洛冰河有意引导，却是老宫主在刻意影响。 沈清秋忍不住又看了一眼洛冰河。 这孩子若是脑子转一转弯，拜其他人为师，也不会生出这么多事端了。但这份执着和死脑 筋，沈清秋却埋怨不起来。他只好叹气： “ 小徒承蒙老宫主厚爱。只是宫主刚才那两剑， 都摆明冲着他来，未免言行不一。 ” 老宫主道： “ 当初是当初，如今却不一样了。沈峰主请让开，我要同这小子算清总账。 ” 沈清秋： “ 我让开，宫主只杀他，不管我？ ” 秋海棠冷笑道： “ 他不管你，我还在这儿呢！ ” 本来她战斗力太低，可以忽略不计，但眼下这个状况，还真有点麻烦。 老宫主道： “ 这畜生忘恩负义，把我害到如此地步，我非手刃了他不可。 ” 沈清秋说： “ 他要是真忘恩负义，也不会留你女儿一条命了。斩草须得除根，这个道理他 比你我都明白。 ” 打死他也没想到，自己居然会有帮洛冰河说话辩解的一天。 闻言，老宫主桀桀怪笑出声。秋海棠猛地掀开盖在他身上的粗毡。沈清秋呼吸滞了几秒。 毛毡之下，只剩一个平整四方的躯体，四肢全都不翼而飞。 老宫主竟然被削成了人棍！一代宗主，就这么人不人、鬼不鬼、脏兮兮地窝在一座小破车 上，只剩一颗头能转动。这画面凄厉骇人至极。 原著沈清秋的下场居然移花接木到了老宫主身上。这梁子结大了，绝对不是几句开导就能 解决的问题！ 老宫主冷笑道： “ 看见了没？他倒还不如斩草除根。 ” 沈清秋严重赞同。为什么不斩草除根！ 这两条小鱼，一个想杀洛冰河，一个想杀沈清秋。秋海棠修为不济，需要有人帮助；老宫 主虽然落魄，却比她强得多。好歹曾经是一派之首，四肢齐断，行动不便，可灵力不减。 男女搭配干活不累，正是瞎子背跛子。 沈清秋赤手折断了剑刃，把它抛到一旁草丛中，死死盯着对面虎视眈眈的两人。 其实他可以赌一把。 虽然面对天琅君这个没有原始数据的人物，洛冰河的挂都不管用，可老宫主却是仍在原著 范围内的角色，主角金身不破定律面对他时，应该还没失去作用。 他可以试着撒手不管，就像当初双湖城副本坑死剥皮魔蝶儿那样，放手让老宫主去砍洛冰 河，看看最后到底是谁坑谁。 老宫主缓缓道： “ 我再问一次，你让不让？ ” 沈清秋垂下手臂，掌心的血原本稍稍止住了流势，又开始滴滴答答下坠。 他抬了抬头，不冷不热地说： “ 老宫主以为清静峰弟子好欺负么？ ” 没办法，现在已经和当初那时候不一样了。 他无论如何也没法说服自己，仗着男主金身不破定律，冷眼旁观，放手让别人砍洛冰河， 赌到底谁熟谁赢。 到了现在，如果他还能心安理得冒着这么大风险利用洛冰河，就真成猥琐人渣了！ 老宫主突然双眼暴起，爆出数声大喝。 他没了四肢，把灵力蕴在喝声里，依此出击。每一声大喝，沈清秋都感觉有一阵强劲的灵 流刀削斧砍般铺面袭来，威势不输暴击。草木狂摇，林叶斜飞。沈清秋用尚在流血的右手 握住剑鞘挡了几下，震颤之中，掌心伤口传来剧痛，可他不敢换手，不用左手抱住洛冰河 他怕会把人摔出去！ 即便被削成了人棍，老宫主灵力却分毫不弱。难怪秋海棠要仰仗他。正这么想，老宫主忽 然一声长吼，修雅剑剑鞘传来极轻的裂声，终是没挡住。 一阵强力袭来，沈清秋被向后掀倒。掀倒途中他转了个身，以己为肉垫，没让洛冰河摔到 地上，又被他重量压得眼冒金星。 老宫主总算不嚎了，秋海棠推着他慢慢靠近。 他平息一阵，俯视搂着洛冰河的沈清秋： “ 你倒也真是护着他。 ” 沈清秋心想，要是洛冰河醒着，自己怕是反而不会这样护着他了。 老宫主道： “ 为何不用灵力还击？莫非你已经油尽灯枯？ ” 沈清秋不答话，一缕一缕的细小白絮飞过，即将沾上洛冰河苍白的脸颊，他轻轻一吹，白 絮歪歪扭扭斜飞了出去。 老宫主以为他这是认命待死的表现，不再理会，目光一转，凝在洛冰河安静睡着的脸上。 他刚才吼叫不止的模样被抹去了一样，忽然消失，现出了一种痴痴之态。 沈清秋： “……” 这个表情 …… 很不对劲啊。 老宫主痴痴地看了半晌，叹道： “ 睡着的时候，是最像的。 ” 他的眼神毛茸茸的上下爬动，如果他有手，一定就摸到洛冰河脸上去了。沈清秋微觉反胃 ，不由自主把洛冰河的脑袋抱住，往怀里带了带。两人现在是洛冰河紧紧依偎在他身上、 头也靠在他胸口的姿势。 沈清秋沉声道： “ 你看清楚，这不是苏夕颜。 ” 也许这个名字唤醒了老宫主，他恶狠狠地道： “ 要是能乖乖听话，权势，地位，幻花宫， 什么我不会传给他？偏偏一个两个，都忘恩负义。忘恩负义！ ” 一连咆哮了几十次忘恩负义，他忽然又神情一转，柔和起来，哼哼道： “ 夕颜 …… 过来 …… 让师尊 …… 让我 ……” 老宫主陷入了迷离之中，口水顺着嘴角滑下，秋海棠悄悄后退，面露嫌恶之色。 沈清秋心下雪亮，反胃感愈发强烈。 难怪一直老宫主对洛冰河都好的有些奇怪。难怪苏夕颜明明是他最心爱的弟子，结果对幻 花宫却毫不留恋，说叛出师门、就叛出师门，义无反顾跟魔界青年双宿双飞去了。 这种 “ 心爱 ” ，跟猥亵也差不多了。老宫主青睐洛冰河，肯定是从他身上找到了昔年爱徒的 影子，对苏夕颜病态的占有欲延伸到了洛冰河身上，妄想把他培养成听话的乖娃娃。 但看他这种狂态，恐怕不止要洛冰河做接班人这么简单。 “ 听话 ” 也远远不止字面意思。 不怪洛冰河要把他削成人彘。 沈清秋一手覆上洛冰河后脑，把他的脸压在自己胸口旁，不让老宫主继续对着他意淫。忍 无可忍道： “ 你够了！ ” 一看不到那张脸，老宫主面部肌登时垮下，痉挛般抽搐一阵，目光满溢怨恨，猛地张开 嘴。 可他没叫出声音。两颗眼球凸了出来，整个人突然定成一尊石像。 沈清秋屏住呼吸片刻。老宫主喉咙里咕噜咕噜，眼白血丝密密爬了上来。 可就是动弹不得。 哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈！ 终于来了！ 真当他那么傻逼圣父，被打不知道还手吗？！ 真当他多拖了个人就弱到不能啪啪扇脸扇回去吗？！ 秋海棠惊疑： “ 怎么了？ ” 她似要拔剑，沈清秋道： “ 秋姑娘，奉劝你一句，不要拔剑，不要妄动灵力，除非你想像 他一样。 ” 秋海棠疑惑地转到老宫主前面， “ 啊 ” 的尖叫出声。 之间老宫主那张苍老的脸上，密密麻麻的皱纹之间，长满了绿色的肉芽，似乎剧痛难忍， 不但不能动弹，连话都说不出来。 秋海棠颤声道： “ 你干了什么？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 我什么都没干。但别忘了，这可是在别人的墓室里。你们以为魔族不会有防 护措施？ ” 空气中漂浮着的、像是吹散的蒲公英般的白絮，其实是一种魔界植物， “ 情丝 ” 。 这种植物会在活物身上下种，而且尤其容易被发散能量的人吸引。乱动灵气或者魔气，就 会把种子们吸到身上。这也是沈清秋刚才尽量坚持肉搏而不动用灵力的原因。 “ 情丝 ” 入肉，不痛微痒，以血肉为土壤，一旦发芽，破皮而出，每长一寸都是撕肉挖血的 疼。而且越动灵力长得越快，敢打暴击，疯长一阵，瞬间就能发芽。 老宫主刚才一直用吼声攻击，灵流汇聚在头部和喉咙，现在长满了一脸的肉芽。肉芽茎看 起来都是血管，表面微带着薄薄的茸毛，根还在皮下往里面长，一直长到跟神经紧密相 连。 沈清秋啧啧道： “ 老宫主千万别再大吼大叫了，不然情丝暴长，长入了脑髓，那可真就无 力回天了。 ” 这景象既恶心又恐怖，秋海棠捂着嘴，抖了一阵，终于忍不住，两眼一翻，晕了过去。 一个动弹不得，一个没了意识。完胜！ 沈清秋松了口气，抱着洛冰河艰难地站了起来。 老宫主肌肉紧绷，含含糊糊地说： “ 别高兴得太早，你也好不到哪里去。 ” 仅仅是说几个字，他就痛得面孔扭曲，满脸肉芽也跟着齐齐发颤。 沈清秋呵了一声回应。 从右臂到肩头，爬上了深入血肉、歇斯底里的疼痛。 刚进来挡住那两把剑时，逼不得已动用过灵力，现在终于跟着发芽了。 不过，还好，总算这次没坑了洛冰河。","CHAPTER 60: HUAN HUA PALACE MASTER Ah, that’s right! After all, at the end of the day, a master is not obligated to help his disciple quench his fire 219 . Even if he was the one who accidentally rubbed against it and stoked the fire, it’s all the same! Shen Qingqiu pushed Luo Binghe up abruptly, placed a palm on his chest, and sent in a few waves of spiritual energy. Although it didn’t amount to much, it was all he could afford to give. Everything else can be ignored! Ignored! Exiting the stone sarcophagus and following Dream Demon’s directions, he dragged and pulled Luo Binghe all the way to “The East End.” After a while, the walls of the tomb gradually grew damp, the soles of his feet became slippery, and the moss was thicker. It was not easy to keep steady. Shen Qingqiu slowed down to avoid slipping. As they continued, weeds and wildflowers bloomed among the moss as the tomb gradually widened. Trees of varied heights rose on both sides. Not only was the ground slippery, but the gnarled and twisted old tree roots also threatened to trip them from time to time. Insects flew by, and the chirping calls of birds could be heard. A blue-and-black zenith suddenly rose up high above them. Inlaid with flashing white crystals, it resembled a curtain of a starlit night. Despite the illusion of being in a jungle, they have not left the Holy Mausoleum but only arrived at one of the special crypts within it. Each crypt in the Holy Mausoleum was designed by the nobles of the past generations for their own use. Its designs were strange and varied. Similar to an apartment, the tenants move in bringing only what they have, and decorate the rest of the house in accordance to their preferences. Experts in the field of mechanisms unduly favor the Qimen Dunjia ancient divination tradition 220 . Demon beast tamers prefer to use guardian beasts. Herbalists cultivate poisonous flowers and grasses. The owner of this tomb was obviously the last type. The trees and flowers here seemed ordinary, but Shen Qingqiu was determined not to touch them. He removed his robe and covered both their heads. Pressing his hand against Luo Binghe’s waist, he took a cautious step forward. The grass and leaves rustled. Suddenly, a piercing sound accompanied by a flash of cold white light shattered the stillness of the air. Shen Qingqiu’s hand snapped down sharply, the Xiu Ya sword at his waist flew out and slammed in a cross to block the sudden attack. The force of strengthfrom both sides did not relent. This obstacle had not been resolved before a second flash of white light struck. This time, it directly stabbed at Luo Binghe’s throat. The Xiu Ya sword was blocking the first sword and couldn’t be recalled; neither could he throw Luo Binghe aside. If he fell amongst those treacherous flowers and plants, he would be done for! He raised his arm and seized the edge of the sword with his bare hand. The blade cut deeply into his palm, but he could still hold it firmly, and it did not advance another half inch. Blood did not dripit poured out. It spilled over Shen Qingqiu’s clothes and dyed the grass on the ground bright red. He finally realized how painful it must have been when Luo Binghe had previously grabbed at his blade. Shen Qingqiu’s eyes reddened. He jerked his head and his pupils shrank. I never imagined that the “strays 221 ” Tianlang-Jun spoke of was actually referring to these two people. Two people emerged from within the shadows of the gnarled old trees. To be precise, only one person stepped out; the other one was pushed on a wheelchair-like contraption. The one standing was a beautiful woman with a slender waist and full bosom. The one being wheeled forward was wrapped in a rough felt blanket from the neck down, but the exposed head was not unfamiliar to Shen Qingqiu. The flying sword still strove to move forward. Shen Qingqiu could not loosen his grip. The force was strong, and the blade was close to slicing his palm in half. His expression did not change except for the addition of a fake smile: “Lady Qiu, Old Palace Master, I trust you’ve been well.” Qiu Haitang’s eyes were filled with resentment. The Old Palace Master’s head moved agitatedly, and his voice was hoarse: “Peak Lord Shen, look at me. Do I look well?” The word “well”it’s just used as a casual greeting and not meant to be taken literally. Shen Qingqiu gave a dry laugh. Upon careful observation, he found that the use of the word “well” was indeed greatly ironic at this point. In the past, the Old Palace Master was a prominent figure in the cultivation world. During their first meeting at the Immortal Alliance Conference and during the unrest at Jinlan City, his bearing and appearance were faultless. But now, the previously meticulously kept snow white beard had become dirty and tangled, his face was so lined that soil filledthe creases, and the wrinkles piled up were denser than the aged trees behind him. The Old Palace Master said darkly: “You must find my current appearance strange.” Shen Qingqiu thought, would you let us go if I say I don’t find it strange at all? What his mouth said: “I heard that the Old Palace Master had retired from general affairs to go back to his native place and live in seclusion 222 or was roaming 223 around without a care in the world.” The Old Palace Master sneered: “Retired or roaming the world? Did you really believe that? In the entire Huan Hua Palace, the entire world, how many people actually believe it? If you want the truth, ask your good disciple.” He didn’t know what was going on, but they seemed to be looking to settle a score with Luo Binghe. Shen Qingqiu did not bat an eyelid. He shifted Luo Binghe to his back and shielded him. Qiu Haitang seethed with hatred: “Shen Jiu, I have said before that I would recognize you even if you have turned to ashes. I have long known your act of self-destruction at Huayue City was fake. Committing suicide as a form of atonement? Hehe, you’re not that kind of person. In the Demon Realm, I caught sight of you. You really were still alive!” You recognized only my body, but not my soul. What‘s the use of it… Shen Qingqiu lamented helplessly. On the day he was captured by Sha Hualing at the Chi Yun cave, Shen Qingqiu rescued the various factions and she caught a glimpse of him. It roused her doubts, and from thereon she became suspicious. Unfortunately, after he returned to Cang Qiong Mountain sect and was subsequently snatched away by Luo Binghe, Qiu Haitang also crossed the border and followed them into the Demon Realm. Luo Binghe had been busy rounding up a large number of Black Moon Rhinoceros Pythons to break the sacred enchantment. He was bound to be overwhelmed and distracted, and so did not notice that someone had secretly snuck in. To summarize: A woman’s hatred cannot be underestimated. It’s just that, for these two people to be allied, it had never occurred to Shen Qingqiu. Nor does he know when they had started conspiring together. Thinking of this, a thought occurred to Shen Qingqiu: “Back when Lady Qiu suddenly appeared in Jinlan City, was it thanks to the Old Palace Master?” Since Zhuzhi-Lang has denied involvement in this, it stands to reason that others had a hand in it. How else could Qiu Haitang, who had no standing tospeak of, have obtained the chance to come forward and denounce him? The Old Palace Master smiled coldly, neither confirming nor denying. Fluffy white dandelion seeds swayed and drifted in the air before them. Shen Qingqiu said: “I wonder if I have ever offended the Old Palace Master…” The Old Palace Master: “Since it has come to this, there is no need to hide it from you.” His voice rasped as if there was something lodged in his throat: “When Luo Binghe first came to my Huan Hua Palace, I nurtured him carefully and gave him all my support. But he refused to acknowledge me as his master and wouldn’t hear of marrying my daughter. It was clear he still had you on his mind. Naturally, I wanted to know what kind of excellent person Peak Lord Shen was. Who would have guessed the type of history that would be revealed to me instead? Regarding your background, I know everything. Who you were apprenticed with, the things you did, how you managed to enter Cang Qiong Mountain sectit really was extraordinary. Even if there had been no sowers on the scene, you would have been guaranteed a spot in the water dungeon. Although it wasn’t part of the plan, it mattered not to me.” It would seem that back then, the Huan Hua Palace disciples’ antagonism towards him was not instigated by Luo Binghe, but rather the deliberate influence of the Old Palace Master. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help shooting a glance at Luo Binghe. This child, if he had been less pig-headed and accepted other people as his master, a lot of grief could have been avoided. But Shen Qingqiu could not begrudge him his brainless willfulness. He had to sigh: “This youngster was truly cherished by Old Palace Master. But pardon my skepticism, trying to skewer him with two swords is very much at odds with your words.” The Old Palace Master: “That was then, this is now. Peak Lord Shen, please step aside. Where you want to go, what you wish to do, I no longer care. I just want to settle things with this brat.” Shen Qingqiu: “If I step aside, the Palace Master will kill him and let me off?” Qiu Haitang sneered: “He may let you off, but I am still here!” Originally, her weak fighting prowess meant she can be overlooked, but now this situation was truly getting out of hand. The Old Palace Master: “This thankless wretch, ruining me to this extent I won’t rest till he’s dead.” Shen Qingqiu said: “If he really was as ungrateful as you say, he wouldnot have left you and your daughter alive. To completely destroy something, one must destroy root and branch 224 . This, I’m sure, you understand better than I do.” He never thought there would come a day when he had to speak up in Luo Binghe’s defense. Hearing this, the Old Palace Master gave a peculiar laugh. Qiu Haitang jerked off the rough felt blanket covering his body, and Shen Qingqiu forgot to breathe. Beneath the blanket lay a strangely square torso. All four limbs were missing. The Old Palace Master was actually sliced into a human stick! A great leader of his generation reduced to such a miserable state, barely considered human and more miserable than a ghost. Bedraggled and filthy, with only the head being able to turn about. The original Shen Qingqiu’s fate has been transferred to the Old Palace Master! This grudge was too heavy, it definitely can’t be placated with just a few quotes about enlightenment and compassion from Chicken Soup for the Soul! The Old Palace Master sneered: “Your good disciple’s handiwork. Seen enough? He might as well have destroyed root and branch.” Shen Qingqiu gravely agreed. Why didn’t you destroy root and branch! These two little fish, one wants to kill Luo Binghe, one wants to kill Shen Qingqiu. Qiu Haitang isn’t skilled enough to take him down by herself; the Old Palace Master may have been crippled but he was much more powerful than her. The body of a starved camel is still bigger than a horse 225 . In spite of everything, he had once been the great leader of a sect. He may no longer have the use of his four limbs, but his spiritual power remains undiminished. Men and women who work side by side will not tire 226 . This pair complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, like a blind man carrying a cripple. Shen Qingqiu snapped the blade with his bare hands and threw it into the grass, staring at the two people facing him. Actually, he could take a gamble. When facing Tianlang-Jun, a character whose data had not existed previously, Luo Binghe’s plot armor was useless. But the Old Palace Master did play a role in the original work, and hence should be subjected to the same laws dictating the protagonist’s golden undying body. This effect should still be in place. He could try standing back, let the Old Palace Master hack at Luo Binghe, and like back at Shuang Hu City, see who ends up dead instead. The Old Palace Master slowly said: “I will ask once more, will you stand aside, or not?”Shen Qingqiu lowered his arm, the blood flowing from his palm had slowed to a trickle. He formed his reply. He looked up and said coldly: “Just like the Old Palace Master has said, he is my good disciple. You tell me, would I stand aside?” Can’t be helped, things have changed. Now it’s no longer the same as it was back then. In any case, he couldn’t bring himself to do it, to spectate from the sidelines as others chopped at Luo Binghe while he speculated on who would be the winner. At this stage, if he could still gamble with Luo Binghe’s life, he would be no different from the original scum villain! The Old Palace Master’s pupils suddenly narrowed and seemed to flee from the expanding whites of his eyes. He gave an earth-shaking roar. His four limbs were gone, so he poured his spiritual power into his roar instead. With every bellow, Shen Qingqiu felt a powerful stream of spiritual energy condensed into sharp blades sweep at him, and the attacks were not trifling. The grass swayed and leaves were sent flying. Shen Qingqiu gripped the scabbard with his still bleeding right hand and blocked a few times. The excruciating pain on his right palm made him tremble, but he did not dare switch to his other hand. Without the use of his left hand to hold onto Luo Binghe, he was afraid he would lose his grip! Despite having been sliced into a human stick, the Old Palace Master still retained his powerful spiritual force. It is no wonder Qiu Haitang still stuck with him. He had just thought of this when the Old Palace Master suddenly gave a drawn-out roar. A faint crack sounded from the scabbard of the Xiu Ya sword it could not block the attack. The violent strike came, and Shen Qingqiu fell over backward. On the way down, he twisted around and used himself as a meat shield, not letting Luo Binghe hit the ground. He ended up squashed by the full weight of his body and saw stars. The Old Palace Master finally stopped howling, and Qiu Haitang wheeled him over slowly. He seemed to calm down for a while as he stared down at Shen Qingqiu holding onto Luo Binghe: “Even while falling, you would still protect him.” Qiu Haitang ground her teeth: “Fake, it’s all fake. This man… at this time, just who are you putting on this show for!” The Old Palace Master: “Why didn’t you use spiritual force to fight back?”Shen Qingqiu said: “Naturally, it’s because I’m exhausted.” Fine wispy threads of white floated over, about to land on Luo Binghe’s pale cheeks. Shen Qingqiu gently puffed at it, and the white fluff scattered away. The Old Palace Master assumed he had resigned himself to his fate, and stopped paying attention to him. He turned to focus his stare on Luo Binghe’s quietly sleeping face. The madness he had displayed earlier while bellowing his attacks was wiped clean from his face, replaced with unnerving intensity. Shen Qingqiu: “…” This expression… doesn’t seem right. The Old Palace Master gazed at him for a long while then sighed: “When you close your eyes, you resemble her the most. And also when you’re being cold.” His eyes traveled over Luo Binghe’s face greedily. If he still had hands, he would have reached out to fondle as well. Shen Qingqiu felt ill. He couldn’t help clasping Luo Binghe’s head and pulling him closer into his arms. The two were now in a position where Luo Binghe was cozily snuggled against him with his head resting on Shen Qingqiu’s chest. Shen Qingqiu’s voice was low: “Open your eyes, he isn’t Su Xiyan.” The name roused the Old Palace Master from his daze, and he began swearing in rage: “Why didn’t you heed my orders? Why won’t you obey! Did I not treat you well? Didn’t you want the Huan Hua Palace and my position? I know you’ve always wanted it! If you had been loyal to me, there’s nothing I would not have given to you! But first her, then youboth of you are ingrates! Ingrates!” He raved and ranted, pouring his malice into a vicious diatribe against Tianlang-Jun and Shen Qingqiu, before continuing to snarl about ungratefulness. Suddenly, he turned his head, his twisted expression softening. He spoke in a coaxing manner: “Xiyan… come over here… Shizun has something nice for you, drink this…” The Old Palace Master sank into a confused state again, saliva dribbling from the corners of his mouth. Qiu Haitang backed away slowly, disgust brimming in her eyes. Shen Qingqiu’s heart felt frozen in his chest as his nausea grew. Unable to tolerate the Old Palace Master leering at him, Shen Qingqiu lifted the back of Luo Binghe’s head with his hand and pressed his face to his chest. Fed up, he snapped: “That’s enough!”With Luo Binghe’s face hidden from sight, the Old Palace Master’s features went slack, the facial muscles twitching for a bit. Eyes filling with resentment, he opened his mouth."
"见沈清秋半拖半扛着洛冰河就要走，老宫主喉咙里 “ 啊啊 ” 叫出声来 , 因为急迫 , 从小车上摔 了下去 , 没有四肢的躯体在地上花草中艰难地扭动 , 一蹭一蹭朝前爬，看着既可怖又可怜。 老宫主喃喃道： “ 别走 …… 别走 …… 不要走 ……” 沈清秋脚底溜得越发快。谁知老宫主突然 双目暴睁，喉底发出咆哮。 他居然拼着不要命也要攻击！ 沈清秋已经搞不清他到底是不想让他们走、还是不想让洛冰河活了。他用已经开裂的剑鞘 勉强挡了一次，右手受震 , 牵动了冒了个头的血芽，痛得撕心裂肺 , 可居然还没扔开洛冰 河。剧痛之下，血气上涌 , 他猛地看向老宫主，眼里杀气顿生。 老宫主刚才吼了一次，又有不少肉芽破皮而出，甚至有的从眼角延伸生长出来。他似乎已 经感觉不到疼痛了，哈哈狂笑，在地上翻了几滚，像条猪肉一般，滚到秋海棠身边，冲着 她耳朵大喊： “ 你不要是要杀沈清秋吗？他就在你眼前，睡什么？！快起来，杀他！把他 们全杀光！ ” 他真的疯了！ 秋海棠被喊得悠悠醒来，一睁眼就是一张枯橘皮的老脸，上面还生满异物，血洞密集，当 场魂飞魄散，歇斯底里尖叫不止，拔剑往空中乱砍。沈清秋怕她乱动灵力，把情丝种子也 引到身上，喝道： “ 冷静！ ” 老宫主怪叫： “ 快！快！你不是一直求我帮忙吗？现在他要撑不住了，快动手！ ” 秋海棠把沈清秋看在眼里，这才像稍稍回了魂，两手发抖，眼睛发直。 平心而论，沈清秋对此女没有什么仇恨，说起来她还是原装货的苦主。可她要是非得在这 儿挡路，他就不得不出手了。 意料之外的是，秋海棠却并没有像以往那样不问青红皂白杀上来，而是呆呆瞪着沈清秋， 瞪着他怀里的洛冰河，非但不前进，反而后退了几步。 她嘴唇哆哆嗦嗦： “ 没可能 …… 没可能 …… 假的！都是假的！不是我哥。不是我哥！ ” 怎么回事？ 她又哭又叫： “ 我什么都没做、我凭什么要受这么多年的苦？！ ” 沈清秋愕然。秋海棠不过是昏迷了短短一瞬，醒来的时候怎么就跟换了个人似的？或说， 像是看到什么不能接受的东西，被吓疯了似的。 沈清秋心知有蹊跷，沉声道： “ 你别乱动。 ” 老宫主叫道： “ 你还等什么？！ ” 秋海棠失去理智，抱着头冲沈清秋尖叫： “ 你为什么不杀我。你为什么不杀我？！ ” 沈清秋被叫得一头雾水，秋海棠夺路而逃。他在后面喊道： “ 喂！ ” 在圣陵里乱跑，死路一条！ 可人已经跑远了，没那个闲时间来追了。沈清秋心里给她点了个蜡，继续前进。 老宫主见她跑远，最后一丝希望也消散无踪，呆呆趴在地上，突然埋头啃了一口草叶，兀 自大笑不止。笑着笑着，头上肉芽越长越密、越生越快，瞬息之间包满了他整个脑袋。不 久之后，他就再也笑不出声了，沈清秋似乎还听到了颅骨脑髓被挤压的异响。老宫主呼呼 喘了几口粗气，头重重搁到地上，再也抬不起来了。 一代宗主，居然死的如此凄厉难看，也实在令人唏嘘。 沈清秋没走几步，一个空朦朦的声音在耳边响起，似乎是从四面八方传来的。天琅君语音 带笑： “ 沈峰主真是玩儿的一手好捉迷藏。不如猜猜，我们什么时候能再见面？ ” 沈清秋摸了摸腿，摸到了一手的异物，额头冷汗涔涔流下。情丝已经顺着血脉长到了腿 上。 天琅君又传音道： “ 一路向东，是想回到破界入口逃出圣陵么？ ” 这厮居然知道他的方位。沈清秋暗暗心惊，低头看了看自己的腿。 一旦让腿上的情丝彻底生根，到时候想走也走不了了。他咬咬牙，看了一眼洛冰河，把心 一横，撕开下摆，抓住一片血芽，猛地一撕！ 他脑子里似乎出现了长达数十秒的空白。好像被撕掉了一整片皮肉。 沈清秋一连喘了好几口气，渐渐清醒过来，这才发现自己呼吸的声音听起来，像极了在哽 咽。 他现在连抹一把脸都做不到。没办法。真的 …… 太他妈疼了！ 虽然血流成河，可好歹是能走路了。他刚才还觉得洛冰河看上去惨，谁料到他现在的模样 ，才真正是十二分的凄惨。 天琅君知道他的方位，必然在往这边赶来。再带着洛冰河继续往东走，一定会正面撞上他 的两个好亲戚。妈的老宫主真害死个人，都是被他活活拖成这样的！ 沈清秋出了这间野林一般的墓殿，途径几间墓室。他迅速进去捡了一口还算干净舒适的石 棺，护着洛冰河的脑袋，小心翼翼将他安置进去。手背一试他额头，还是热得烫手，眉心 间的印记却愈发鲜亮艳红。 沈清秋把心魔剑压在洛冰河手下，定了定神，这才缓缓合上棺盖。 天琅君不紧不慢走在前，竹枝郎紧随其后。 石道一转，沈清秋手持修雅剑，站在一件墓殿正中央，冷冷注视着他们，似是等候多时 了。 他半边青衣都被染成赤红色，右手还有鲜血顺着干涸的痕迹往下滑落，嘴唇几乎和脸色一 样白。 天琅君讶然： “ 不过是片刻未见，沈峰主为何变得如此狼狈。 ” 沈清秋回望他。明明在怒殿被岩浆火柱吞了个满口，现在天琅君身上却连个烤灵芝的香味 也闻不到，顶多黑衣焦了一点边缘，真是岂有此理。 天琅君问道： “ 沈峰主的爱徒呢？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 出去了。 ” 天琅君笑了： “ 沈峰主还在这里，他怎么可能会出去。 ” 沈清秋也对他笑笑。 这么笑来笑去的，天琅君忽然笑不出来了。因为他发现，他迈不出步了。 他低头看看。从脚底到腰部，不知什么时候，被一层极坚固的晶冰覆盖住了，并且覆盖范 围还在顺着他身躯往上蔓延。竹枝郎情况比他略强，双腿和一条手臂也已被冻得严严实 实。他这才注意到，这间墓殿十分寒冷。 天琅君定了定，道： “ 漠北氏。 ” 猜的到很准。这一间墓殿，正是漠北君祖父亲手所设。他们这一支血脉擅操纵冰，冰法魔 界无人可出其右，身后墓殿也与冰法息息相关。 在圣陵之内，处处都是可以利用的场地。不必他出手，自然有能牵制敌手的事物。沈清秋 记得原著描写过，一旦有温度比墓殿空气温度高的东西进入，便会被当场冻结，变成冰雕 ，冻上个两三天，就碎成了冰渣渣。所以他进来之前先调动灵脉将身体温度降到最低。不 然坑人不成反被坑就划不来了。所以他看上去才会脸色青白。 一句话的功夫，坚冰已爬到天琅君胸口，他表情不变，手中魔气腾腾，却化不破包裹住他 拳头的冰晶，收效甚微。就算不能一直冻住他，至少也能拖半个时辰。 天琅君道： “ 看来真不是错觉。沈峰主对我族禁地，几乎可以说是了如指掌。 ” 沈清秋一句不话不说，冲他们摆一下手，转身就走。 天琅君看了一眼竹枝郎，缓缓道： “ 我说过，你若真要带沈峰主去魔界，就得保证他不会 捣乱。该怎么做，你知道。 ” 竹枝郎低声道： “…… 属下明白。 ” 听了这两句，沈清秋油然而生一阵极其糟糕的预感。 竹枝郎道： “ 沈仙师，对不住了。 ” 别！千万别！你要感谢我我都这么惨了，你要是对我道歉，我还能有命吗！？ 正这么想着，沈清秋本来走得好好的，突然身体一歪，扶住了石壁。 有东西似乎正在从他胃里蠕动挣扎奔涌而出，涌向全身上下无数道筋脉。 这感觉熟悉又可怕。沈清秋险些当场爆出一句草泥马。 天魔之血。 洛冰河现在棺材里睡着，在他体内作乱的，就只可能是别人的血了。 天琅君说： “ 峰主也该不是第一次喝了，怎么还没习惯？ ” 沈清秋强忍住干呕的冲动： “…… 什么时候给我喝的。 ” 天琅君道： “ 沈峰主别忘了，你的仙躯在我们手里已经很长时间了。能做的事太多了。 ” 难怪这么轻易就能判断出他所往方位。 沈清秋停了停，继续往前走。越走腹中越是绞痛，可他速度不减反快。其中有他捱疼能力 增强的缘故，更有知道现在绝对不能跪的缘故。 趁这两位被冻住了，还有机会逃出去。要是等他们解冻，再想坑他们可就难了！ 虽然心里清楚其中利害，可走得越快，竹枝郎催动得越是猛烈，沈清秋忍不住回头狠狠瞪 向他。 说好了要报恩的，就是这样让血虫在他肚子里产卵扎窝合家欢乐吗？！ 天琅君叹道： “ 这样也能走这么多步，沈峰主心志坚定，果非常人。还是该说，你为洛冰 河，连性命都不要了？ ” 忽然，竹枝郎道： “ 君上，我 …… 属下压不住了。 ” 话音未落，沈清秋便觉那阵淤痛陡然化开。 天琅君见他居然跑了起来，很是诧异： “ 你的血不是能压住他的吗？ ” 竹枝郎也大惑不解，道： “ 之前压得住。可这次不知道为什么，压不住了！ ” 沈清秋耳朵里嗡嗡作响，听不清也看不清了，可想着还得把洛冰河拖到入口扔出去，撑着 墙壁继续慢跑。不知踹到了什么东西，晃了一下。 硬扛了这么久，已经临近极限，处在虚脱边缘，他膝盖登时软了。可是这一下却没跪下去 ，而是被一只手牢牢搀住，半提半抱了起来。 沈清秋头昏眼花，双眼聚焦往上看去。 黝黑黯淡的石道里看不清面容，却能看清一双怒火灼灼滔天的眼睛，和一枚赤光流转的印 记。","CHAPTER 61: FOR THE SINGLE PEOPLE PART 1 But he did not make a sound. With his two eyeballs protruding out, his whole body was frozen like a stone statue. Shen Qingqiu held his breath. Gurgling sounds could be heard from the Old Palace Master’s throat and bloodshot veins crawled up his eyes. But he could not move a single step. Finally! Hahahahahahahaha! Was he so stupid and saintly that when beaten he would not fight back? Treating him like he’s so weak he can’t slap you back in the face while dragging another person? Qiu Haitang exclaimed, “What’s wrong?” She moved to draw her sword but Shen Qingqiu interrupted, “Lady Qiu, I advise that you do not draw your sword in vainunless, of course, you want to end up like him.” Suspicious, Qiu Haitang spun around to face the Old Master and screamed. Between the deep folds of his wrinkles, the Old Master’s face was mottled with green pustules and contorted in unbearable pain. Qiu Haitang trembled. “Shen Jiu… you… what have you done?” “I didn’t do anything,” Shen Qingqiu said. “Did you forget that we are in someone else’s tomb? Do you think the Demons will not have any protection? In fact, floating in the air like a blown dandelion were the spores of a demonic plant, ‘QingSi.’ This plant uses the bodies of living beings to germinate and is attracted to people who radiate Qi, be it spiritual energy or demonic energy. This was also why Shen Qingqiu used martial arts instead of his Qi techniques earlier. QingSi embeds itself into the bodies of its victims without any pain except just maybe a slight itch. However, once it sprouts, it tears the flesh and digs into the blood vessels. The faster the Qi circulates, the faster it grows. If a cultivator unleashes his peak energy, it could germinate in an instant. The Old Palace Master had been attacking with his roars, focusing his Qi around his head and throat. Not just his face, it was likely that the insides of his mouth and throat passages were choked with the sprouts of this demonic plant, with its fur-like surface tendrils and the roots sinking under the skin, reaching down deep into the nerves.Shen Qingqiu tutted, “The Old Palace Master must not yell again. Otherwise, it will grow without stopping until it reaches your brain; then truly, you will be dead.” Facing this terrifying and disgusting scene, Qiu Haitang clamped down on her mouth and tried to resist her dizziness but failed. Her eyes rolled into her skull and she fell into a dead faint. With one person immobilized and the other knocked unconscious, this was truly a victory! Shen Qingqiu sighed in relief and struggled to stand up with Luo Binghe in his arms. Muscles straining and through clenched teeth, the Old Palace Master vaguely said, “Don’t rejoice too early, you are no better off.” His face twisted in pain and the sprouts on his face trembled as he said these few words. Shen Qingqiu just huffed in reply. From his right arm to right across his shoulders, a deep hysterical pain mercilessly stabbed his flesh and nerves. To block the two swords earlier, he was forced to use his Qi cultivation and now the spores were germinating. But fortunately, and at the very least, Luo Binghe was safe. Seeing Shen Qingqiu half dragging half carrying Luo Binghe away, the Old Palace Master choked out his cries and toppled down from the wheelchair in his urgency, dragging his limbless body through the flowers and grasses on the grounda piteous and terrifying scene. The Old Palace Master wheezed: “Don’t go… Don’t go…. Don’t leave.“ Shen Qingqiu hastened his steps but who knew that the Old Palace Master’s face would suddenly turn violent and open his mouth to let out a roar? He wanted to bring them down together with him to the grave! Shen Qingqiu could not figure out if the Old Palace Master was unwilling to let them leave or if he just refused to let Luo Binghe live. Shen Qingqiu used the old scabbard to barely block the blow. His right hand trembled as pain ripped through his body from this movement which aggravated the blistering pustules, all the while shielding Luo Binghe protectively. In the agonizing haze, he turned towards the Old Palace Master and his blood surged, killing intention blazing in his eyes. With just that one roar, even more pustules started to sprout from the Old Palace Master’s skin, extending even to the corners of his eyes. However, he no longer seemed to feel pain as he laughed wildly, rolling on the ground like a pork sausage until he reached Qiu Haitang. Shouting loudly into her ear like a mad man, he said, “Don’t you want to kill Shen Qingqiu? He is right in front ofyour eyes! Quick, get up! Kill him! Kill them all!” Qiu Haitang groggily awoke after the Old Palace Master shouted at her. Opening her eyes to a face like a withered orange peel mottled with an unknown monstrosity, her blood drained. Screaming hysterically, she slashed down with her sword. Shen Qingqiu, afraid that she might agitate her Qi further, thus attracting the lingering spores, yelled: “Calm down!” Undeterred, the Old Palace Master shouted, “Quickly! Quickly! Did you not ask me to help? He is unable to hold on any longerdo it now!” Qiu Haitang met Shen Qingqiu’s eyes, their gaze steady and unwavering. All in all, Shen Qingqiu did not hold any enmity for Qiu Haitang. She was after all the original Shen Qingqiu’s victim. But if she insisted on blocking his way, he would not hesitate to retaliate. Surprisingly, Qiu Haitang was not the indiscriminate killing machine of the past. Glancing between Shen Qingqiu and Luo Binghe who was held in his arms, she not only did not advance but retreated a few steps. Her lips quivering, she said, “It is not possible… it is impossible… This is fake! It is all fake! This is not my brother. My brother is never wrong, it’s not big brother. You lied to me!” What’s going on? She cried and screamed, “I don’t know. I didn’t know it was like this. I didn’t do anything, so just why did I have to endure so many years of suffering?” Shen Qingqiu was astonished. Qiu Haitang had only fainted for a short while, so why was it that when she woke up, it was almost as if she was a different person? Or maybe, it was because she saw something she couldn’t accept and was terrified to the point where she went crazy. Shen Qingqiu thought that there was something amiss and sternly said, “Don’t move.” Old Palace Master shouted, “What are you waiting for?” Qiu Haitang, having lost her sanity, held her head as she screamed at Shen Qingqiu, “Exactly how do you feel when you look at me? Do you hate me? Pity me? Why do you want to torture me by keeping me in this world? Why didn’t you kill me? Why don’t you kill me?” After being randomly screamed at, Shen Qingqiu was confused enough that Qiu Haitang seized the chance to run away. He called out at her back, “Come back! If you run about in the Holy Mausoleum, you will definitely die!” But she had already run off into the distance and he did not have the timeto chase after her. Shen Qingqiu inexplicably felt a sense of loss. In his heart, he lit a candlelight vigil for her and continued forward. The Old Palace Master could only watch as she ran off into the distance. As Shen Qingqiu started to walk away too, the Old Palace Master’s last shred of hope disappeared without a trace. He was on the ground, dazed, before he suddenly buried his head into the grass surrounding him and tore off a mouthful of vegetation. The Old Palace Master continued to laugh uncontrollably. As he laughed, the sprouts on top of his head started to grow faster, longer, and denser. In an instant, his whole head looked as if it was wrapped up with vines. Not long afterward, he wasn’t able to laugh anymore. Shen Qingqiu could almost hear the sounds of his skull being squeezed. The Old Palace Master exhaled a few shaky breaths before his head crashed heavily onto the ground. He wouldn’t ever lift it again. Even though he was the head of a clan, he died in such a gruesome, horrifying way. It was enough to make people sigh with pity. Before Shen Qingqiu was able to take more than a few steps, an echoing voice sounded next to his ear. It seemed to come from every direction. Tianlang- Jun’s voice held traces of amusement: “Peak Master Shen was able to play such a great game of hide-and-seek. Why don’t you guess how long it would take until we meet again?” Shen Qingqiu broke out in cold sweat as he reached down to run his hand against his leg and encountered a foreign object. The QingSi had already followed the blood vessels to grow on his legs. Tianlang-Jun’s voice was sent over again: “You have been heading east the whole time. Is it because you want to go back to the hole in the protective barrier to escape the Holy Mausoleum?” This bastard actually knows where he’s heading. Shen Qingqiu tried to suppress his shock before lowering his head to look at his leg. If he let the QingSi on his legs take root, when the time came, he wouldn’t be able to leave even if he wanted to. Shen Qingqiu gritted his teeth and took a glance at Luo Binghe. Then he hardened his heart, ripped open the helm on his robes, grabbed a handful of sprouts, and viciously yanked. His brain seemed to have conjured up several dozens of seconds of blankness. The pain felt like he was tearing out a part of his flesh. Shen Qingqiu gave a series of labored pants and slowly came back to himself before he realized that the sounds that he made as he panted was like hewas trying to choke down sobs. At the moment, he wasn’t able to even reach up to wipe his face. There was just no way. This really… hurt way too fucking much! Although his blood was flowing like a river, at least he could finally walk again. Before, he thought that Luo Binghe looked to be in a pitiful state. Now, who could have thought that his appearance at the moment is what really should be considered 120% miserable? Since Tianlang-Jun knew where he was, he would definitely go where Shen Qingqiu was. If he continued to bring Luo Binghe with him and head east, they would definitely directly meet Luo Binghe’s ‘nice relatives.’ Shen Qingqiu left the ancient forest tomb and went past a couple of other rooms in the tombs. Swiftly, he picked a stone coffin that could be considered clean and comfortable and, protecting Luo Binghe’s head, carefully placed his unconscious disciple inside. He reached up and placed the back of his hand against Luo Binghe’s forehead. It was still hot enough to burn his hand. At the center of Luo Binghe’s forehead, the Demon Mark emitted a bright red light. Shen Qingqiu placed the Heart Devil sword under Luo Binghe’s hands. He gathered his composure before finally sealing the coffin. Tianlang-Jun walked unhurriedly in the front while Zhuzhi-Lang followed closely behind. As the stone road turned, they saw Shen Qingqiu standing in the middle of a tomb with the Xiu Ya sword in his hand. He was watching them coldly, looking as if he had been waiting for their arrival for a while. Half of his light green robes was dyed scarlet. Blood flowed over the dried blood tracks on his left hand and dripped onto the floor. His lips seemed as pale as his face. Tianlang-Jun was astonished. “It has only been a short while since our previous interaction. How is it that Peak Master Shen is this battered?” Shen Qingqiu looked back at him. He was clearly swallowed whole by a flaming magma pillar in that Anger Tomb. But now, you couldn’t even smell the scent of roasted mushrooms from Tianlang-Jun’s body. The only sign of the adversity was the burned crisp at the edge of his black clothes. Where was the logic? Tianlang-Jun asked, “Where is Peak Master Shen’s beloved disciple?” Shen Qingqiu said, “He left.” Tianlang-Jun laughed, “If Peak Master Shen is still here, how is it possible that he would leave?” Shen Qingqiu also started to laugh with him. As they continued to laugh with one another, Tianlang-Jun suddenly wasn’t able to laugh anymore.Because he realized that he wasn’t able to take another step forward. He lowered his head to see the obstacle. He hadn’t noticed that he was frozen by a thick, solid layer of crystalline ice from the soles of his feet to his waist. The area that it was covering continued to climb up his body. Zhuzhi- Lang was in a worse condition than him. Both of his legs and one of his arms was already frozen in place. Tianlang-Jun finally noticed that the tomb he was in was extremely cold. He sullenly said, “Mobei-Jun.” This tomb hall really was created by Mobei-Jun’s ancestors. They have a natural, unique affinity towards controlling ice in the demon race. Therefore, the tomb hall behind them was also inextricably linked to ice. In the Holy Mausoleum, there were arenas and props everywhere to be used. Even if he didn’t personally engage in conflict, there were other things that could be used to contain the opponent. Shen Qingqiu remembered that in the original novel, as soon as there was something with a temperature higher than the air in the tomb hall, it would immediately be frozen into an ice sculpture. After 2-3 days, it would then shatter into ice shards. So, before he went inside, he circulated his spiritual energy to decrease his own body temperature as low as possible. That was why he appeared to be so pale. In the effort it took to say a single sentence, the solid ice had already climbed up to Tianlang-Jun’s chest. His expression didn’t change. Even with his hand covered in demonic energy, he still wasn’t able to break the ice crystal that covered his fist. The effect that it had was minimal. Even if the ice was not able to freeze him in place forever, it could at least buy around an hour’s worth of time. Tianlang-Jun said, “It looks like it wasn’t my misperception. Peak Master Shen really does seem to know the demon’s forbidden area like the back of his hands.” Shen Qingqiu didn’t reply. He gave them a wave before he turned and walked away. Tianlang-Jun gave Zhuzhi-Lang a glance and calmly said, “I told you before, if you really intend to bring Peak Master Shen to the Demon Realm, you have to promise that he won’t cause any problems. You know what you should do. Zhuzhi-Lang quietly said, “This subordinate understands.” After listening to their interaction, Shen Qingqiu suddenly felt as if he forgot or didn’t take something very important into account."
"天琅君和竹枝郎已经从脚脖子冻到了头顶 , 两尊黑气环绕的冰雕伫立在中央。洛冰河踏入 殿中，丝丝寒冰白气顺着他黑靴往上爬，被毫不留情地踏碎。他冲那两具冰雕各拍一掌 , 坚冰上现出蜿蜒的裂痕。 沈清秋半倚着石壁，道： “ 没用 , 已经成型的晶冰没那么容易碎 , 而且你这么打，也伤不到里 面的他们。倒不如抓紧时机 , 趁他们被封住 , 逃出圣陵。 ” 洛冰河霍然转身 , 又朝他走来。 乍见洛冰河 , 沈清秋又惊又喜。原本就是打算再回石棺那里去接人的，没想到人自己醒了 , 刚想脱口而出问他一句感觉怎么样，却发现洛冰河似乎火气大得很。 洛冰河厉声道： “ 不是说了让你别跟他们一路吗？！ ” 这一句几乎是吼出来的。沈清秋本来就晕，被吼得耳膜隐隐作痛，仿佛遭人迎头浇了一盆 冷水，呆了一下，蓦地一股无名火起，蹿上心头。 他干巴巴地说： “ 你好了吗？ ” 洛冰河语气仍是不善： “ 好什么好？ ” 看他中气十足，多半是好了。 既然如此，也算是还了洛冰河一点人情。好歹说起来，自己也不算人渣得彻底了。 沈清秋点点头： “ 那好。 ” 转了个身，胡乱找了个方向走开。 其实他也不知道该走哪里去，要出圣陵，心魔剑，洛冰河，两者缺一不可，少哪一个都只 能在圣陵内部瞎晃悠。可是，拼了老命把人拖了一路，到头来还被吼一脸，悻悻然的呆着 也没意思。 他没走出几步，石道旁一只咽气烛蓦地亮起，幽幽烛火，照亮了他半张侧脸。 洛冰河突然伸手拉住他： “…… 你哭了？ ” 沈清秋闻言一愣。 他哭了吗？ 他哭了吗？ 他怎么可能哭了！！！ 沈清秋抬起左手擦了擦脸颊，这只完好的手刚才一直牢牢抱着洛冰河，现在才有机会腾出 来做别的事。一摸脸，艹，真的湿漉漉的啊好恶心啊。 沈清秋猛地想起来，这是刚才把腿上破皮生长出来的情丝拔掉的时候疼出来的眼泪。 真难看。 洛冰河刚才声音里的火气消失得无影无踪，他怔怔地道： “ 这么说，我当时隐隐听到师尊 在哭，不是假的？ ” 沈清秋有点恼羞成怒： “ 哭什么哭，不知道！ ” 说完摔手就走，洛冰河连忙从后面抱住他。 好死不死，刚巧抱到了沈清秋被情丝扎根的右手臂，沈清秋忍着没惨叫，还是闷哼了一 声。洛冰河立刻松开，只牵着他左手，借着烛火察看。 越是察看，越是心惊。现在沈清秋身上几乎没有一块能看的地方，伤是伤，血是血，糊作 一团，当真惨不忍睹。 洛冰河记得，昏迷之前，沈清秋分明是完好无损的。他声音发抖： “ 这些 …… 都是为了 …… 我？ ” 沈清秋要吐血了。不然呢？ 他说不出这种话，弄得好像跟敲锣打鼓晒恩情似的，只迸出两个字： “ 放开！ ” 洛冰河瞬息之间换了一张脸，软了下去： “ 不放。师尊你别生气，我错了。 ” 这话他说过很多次！ 沈清秋一掌挥开。赶紧走走走，盲尸都围了上来，在这里挡道像什么样子。 洛冰河被他遣开，又牛皮糖一样缠了上来，掰都掰不下： “ 要不师尊你打我吧。再打一顿 出气可好？ ” 快来人这里有个抖 m 谁快来把他关起来  他脚底飞快，两人走了一路，洛冰河就缠了一路，洛冰河那套路现在沈清秋已经熟悉了， 看准了他吃软不吃硬。磨了半天，沈清秋无奈道： “…… 你老是这样，哭着认错，死性不 改。有什么用？ ” 洛冰河给他说的都快抽泣了： “ 我改还不行吗。师尊不要抛弃我。 ” 看了他这幅窝囊样子，要不是顾念他后脑勺还有自己撞出来的包，沈清秋真恨不得冲他脑 门抽几章。他的教育方式也没问题啊？怎么就养出了一个哭包。混世魔王洛冰河喜欢牵着 师尊衣服哭哭啼啼，说出去像什么样子，谁特么的敢信！？ 宁婴婴都没他爱哭！ 沈清秋快受不了了： “ 谁抛弃你了？啊？ ” 洛冰河道： “ 我昏过去的时候，残存着一点意识，拼命想着要醒来。可是好不容易醒过来 了，发现躺在一口棺材里，师尊又不知道跑哪里去了。我一时气昏了头，以为又被丢下了 ，以为师尊你宁肯跟他们走也不想理我 ……” 一觉醒来，发现被孤零零 “ 抛弃 ” 在棺材里，滋味确实不大好。沈清秋心虚地咳了一下。 洛冰河又道： “ 我刚才不是故意的。不知道为什么，明明心里不想这样，不想说那种话， 可在师尊面前，我总控制不住自己。我知道这样难看、丢人，但是师尊你原来没扔下我， 一直都在护着我，不是我做梦，我好高兴 ……” 究竟是谁比较难看、丢人？ 两个大男人抱成一团擦鼻涕抹眼泪，都不好看，知道吗！？ 大概是因为太高兴了，更多余华丽的话反而说不出来，只知道重复着 “ 高兴 ” 、 “ 开心 ” 两个 简单的词。沈清秋的脸抽搐了两下，揉揉太阳穴，深深叹了口一长气。 算啦。这也不是第一次了。连梦魔都说过，这孩子就是这副鬼德性，当面酷炫狂霸黑得掉 渣，背后说不定又要扭着手绢哭了，还跟他计较什么呢。 话说回来，自己也有够无聊的，刚才那么点小误会，也没啥好生气的，也会莫名其妙发火 ，跟这 sjb 的倒霉孩子也没什么区别了。 他缓了口气： “ 那你现在是真没事了吧？ ” 洛冰河立刻点点头： “ 没事。 ” 刚才烧那么厉害，现在一点儿事都没有了？沈清秋很是怀疑，把手贴上他额头。果然温凉 光滑，沈清秋要把手抽回来，洛冰河的手却覆了上去，压住不让他抽开，交叠双手下的眼 睛亮晶晶的。 这种神情太熟悉了。这不就是当初清静峰上每天咩咩叫跟着他吃草的三好青年小绵羊的神 情吗。 沈清秋被他盯得毛骨悚然，却又不好强行抽回。 当别人正兴高采烈的时候这么做，不就等于啪啪扇脸？ 他说： “ 你真一点事都没有？不头晕？灵力和魔气都没有运转不灵？ ” 洛冰河说： “ 很灵。非常灵。比以往更灵。 ” 说话间，已经到了正东方的一间墓室，洛冰河拔剑，斜斩，照壁上划出一条黑洞洞的空间 裂口。 折了的手臂又神奇地长好了，腿也不瘸了，一脸的血都擦得干干净净，一直不听话的心魔 剑也给收拾的服服帖帖。 沈清秋什么都不想说了，做了个 “ 走吧走吧 ” 的手势，率先穿过了裂口。 陵外光线充足，洛冰河主动伸手来扶沈清秋。 说起来，他们真是很久没这样正常地相处过了。 沈清秋才心底感慨了一句，忍不住瞥了瞥洛冰河。瞧他神清气爽的，看来是真的 “ 很灵 ” 。 亏他还生怕又坑了一次男主，豁了老命来护着，结果人家屁事儿没有，呼呼大睡是在给外 挂续费充值 [ 手动拜拜 ] 正郁闷着，洛冰河忽然道： “ 不过，除了听到师尊在哭 ……” 沈清秋问： “ 谁哭？ ” 洛冰河立刻改口： “ 除了听到有人在哭，还有一种奇怪的感觉。 ” 闻言，沈清秋又有点儿担心了。果然还是有后遗症的吧？他沉吟道： “ 什么感觉？ ” 洛冰河摇了摇头： “…… 说不上来。 ” 沈清秋： “ 疼不疼？ ” 洛冰河道： “ 不疼，很 ……” 他话没说完，脸现困惑之色，朝身下看去。 沈清秋立刻垮下了脸。这次是真想一巴掌把他抡回圣陵去。 天柱你好天柱再见！ 这个话题没能持续下去，就截止了。 天琅君的声音阴魂不散追了上来： “ 沈峰主，为何这么急着要走？你们两位几乎把本族圣 地倒翻了过来，就这么走了，不留下点什么，未免说不过去吧？ ” 他没说一个字，声音就逼近不少。没用多时，就出现在视野中。沈清秋脱力地翻了个白 眼。不过，漠北氏那在陵墓中扛了千百年的冰法能把这两人拖到他们出了圣陵，够良心 了。 洛冰河方才没能把他们轰成碎渣，原本就心中不快，现在人自己送上来了，反倒合意。他 指节喀喀作响，盯着竹枝郎，阴沉道： “ 你竟敢给我师尊喂血。 ” 竹枝郎一窥沈清秋，面露惭色。天琅君道： “ 别用这种表情说这句话。难道你没有给他喂 血吗？否则沈峰主体内另外一道血蛊是谁的？ ” 闻言，洛冰河一僵，握紧了拳头。 沈清秋只是抬了抬握住修雅剑的那只手，洛冰河立刻低声道： “ 师尊不用出手，我一人足 矣。 ” 说打就打！ 三道黑气柱暴风一样冲天翻腾，沈清秋在旁观战，越发深刻地认识到魔和人果然是不同种 族的。 破坏力差别太大了！ 而且洛冰河果然是升级了。果然给外挂续费了！一个时辰多之前还被暴打无力还手，现在 看来，男主光环还是牢牢罩在洛冰河头上的！ 观战中，空中盘旋着一只赤红色的骨鹰，降下双翼，探寻着插【入混战的机会。洛冰河以 一挑二，似乎没注意到那只明显不怀好意的骨鹰，沈清秋却看得清楚，正要出声提醒，那 只骨鹰忽地一个俯冲，向洛冰河头顶掠去。 偷袭？ 沈清秋将修雅剑倒提在手中，眯眼瞄准，朝它猛地投射而出。 雪白的剑身犹如一道剑矢，闪电般将那骨鹰穿刺而过。 谁知他还没松一口气，骨鹰的身躯并不下坠，而是溃散成千珠万滴，朝沈清秋飞去。 那边天琅君忽然收手，跳出了战圈，笑出了声音。洛冰河见了空中血珠飞散的景象，脸上 则闪过一瞬惊惶。 沈清秋蓦地反应过来，这只骨鹰居然是天琅君用自己的血化形凝聚而成的。他故意让骨鹰 偷袭洛冰河，其实是要引得自己出手击落它！ 刚发现这件事，他就被瓢泼血雨浇了一头一脸。 大暴血术，血包两毛一袋，买一袋送两袋，不要钱啦！ 天琅君微微一笑，举手，在空中虚虚一握。沈清秋顿时感觉心脏一滞，似乎真的被一只手 抓在了掌心，恶意揉捏起来。 血量太多，刚才虽然闭紧了嘴巴，可口里还是泛起了淡淡的铁锈味。似乎还是中招了。 沈清秋就呵呵呵呵呵了。 有谁像他一样把天魔血当红牛喝的。有谁像他一样喝过三道天魔血的？ 草泥马，老子不玩儿了！不玩儿了行吗！！！ 洛冰河眼睛都急红了，可天琅君的血在沈清秋体内，又不敢贸然出手，怕他忽然暴催血蛊 ，只能咬牙道： “…… 停手！ ” 竹枝郎见沈清秋脸色一阵青一阵白，忍不住道： “ 君上，手下留情 ……” 天琅君耸肩： “ 那要看另一位小朋友怎么办了。 ” 三道血蛊在沈清秋体内翻江倒海，斗得难解难分。其中，洛冰河的血主要是在护着沈清秋 的五脏与筋脉，压制稳稳着竹枝郎的血，兼之要与天琅君的血勉强抗衡，一心三用，以一 敌二，难免缚手缚脚。最能放手大开大阖倒腾的反而是天琅君的血蛊，因为他完全无所顾 忌。 他对洛冰河道： “ 你想清楚了，再这样下去，先撑不住的是谁？ ” 洛冰河眼神深处焦灼和无措越来越浓，最终，还是退了步。 他说： “ 你先撤！ ” 天琅君分毫没有让一让小辈的长辈觉悟，反道： “ 你先。 ” 洛冰河立刻道： “ 好。 ” 天琅君笑得意味不明： “ 果然是 ……” 他转头看向竹枝郎： “ 怎么办，不知为何，我看见他们，心中竟有种极其不快的感觉呢。 ” 竹枝郎默默点头。 时隔多年，终于有苍穹山派以外的人士感受到了瞎狗眼的不快。 沈清秋自认倒霉，却不想别人也跟着倒霉，他一手捂着心口，勉力保持脸上表情不变： “ 阁下想怎么折腾我，请随意。如你所说，喝了这么多次，也该习惯了。可你若是要洛冰 河的肉身，想都别想。 ” 沈清秋生平最恨那种被作为要挟筹码的角色，想让他扮这种拖后腿的角色，还不如叫他去 死。 洛冰河又气又无奈： “ 师尊 ……” 沈清秋说： “ 你闭嘴。 ” 天琅君奇怪道： “ 谁说我想要他的肉身？ ” 沈清秋无言以对。 天琅君道： “ 他相貌不如我英俊，我为何要他的肉身？ ” 谁说你比他英俊的？ 谁盖章的？ 谁说的谁说的谁说的？ 向天打飞机菊苣亲笔写的洛冰河上天入地前无古人后无来者老少通吃本书第一大帅逼好 么？ 嫌弃洛冰河血统不纯么？！ 沈清秋满脸黑线： “…… 那你到底是想怎样？ ” 竹枝郎道： “ 君上要的是那把剑。 ” 天琅君道： “ 是了。我要送给人界的礼物，缺了那把剑可不行。 ” 呵，想要男主的金手指？ 沈清秋脑袋里刚冒出 “ 痴心妄想 ” 、 “ 不自量力 ” ，只见洛冰河一扬手，竹枝郎也一举臂，瞬 间之间，完成了交接。 雷厉风行，毫不拖泥带水！ 沈清秋瞠目结舌。 你个败家子啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！","CHAPTER 62: FOR THE SINGLE PEOPLE PART 2 Zhuzhi-Lang said, “Master Shen, please pardon me.” Don’t! A thousand times don’t! I got into this miserable state when you wanted to thank me, now that you’re apologizing, can I even hope to live? Shen Qingqiu had just been walking perfectly fine, but suddenly his whole body tilted, holding on to the stone wall for support. It seemed that something was struggling to escape from his stomach, squirming towards the countless veins running through his body. Feeling this familiar awful sensation, Shen Qingqiu nearly busted out a “motherfucker” on the spot. Luo Binghe was still sleeping in that coffin, so the blood wreaking havoc in his body could only belong to someone else. Tianlang-Jun said, “Peak Lord, this shouldn’t be the first time you’ve drank Heavenly Demon’s blood, how come you’re still not used to it?” Shen Qingqiu suppressed the urge to retch. “When did you make me drink it.” Tianlang-Jun said in a vaguely mocking tone, “Peak Lord Shen, don’t forget, your immortal body was in our hands for more than a brief period of time. There really are too many things we could have done.” No wonder it was so easy for them to determine where he was heading. Shen Qingqiu paused, then continued walking forward. The more he walked the sharper the pain in his stomach grew, but he walked faster instead of slowing down. It was partly because he had an increased pain tolerance, but more importantly, he knew he absolutely could not collapse now. While these two were frozen, there was still the opportunity to escape. If he dawdled until they thawed, don’t think of stalling them again! The faster he walked, the more fiercely Zhuzhi-Lang urged the blood into action. Though he clearly knew the risks, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t resist turning to shoot a fierce glare at Zhuzhi-Lang. Is this how you’re repaying a kindness, by making these blood parasites lay eggs, nest, and have a family reunion in his stomach? Tianlang-Jun sighed, “Even in this state you can walk so many steps, Peak Lord Shen is willful and resolute, truly an extraordinary person. I should say, you’re even willing to throw away your own life for my son?” Suddenly, Zhuzhi-Lang said, “My lord, I… this subordinate can’t keep holding on.”Before his words had fallen, Shen Qingqiu felt the pain suddenly dissolve, his whole body lightening. Right away, he broke into a frantic run. Seeing that he was suddenly able to run away, Tianlang-Jun said, astonished, “Isn’t your blood able to restrain him?” Zhuzhi-Lang was also at a loss. “Before, I was able to restrain him. But this time I can’t, I don’t know the reason!” Shen Qingqiu couldn’t hear clearly through the buzzing in his ears and his sight was blurred, but he knew he had to drag Luo Binghe to the entrance and throw him through. Supporting himself on the wall, he continued to jog forwards. He tripped over something under his feet, making his whole body sway. After carrying on for this long, he was already approaching his body’s limits, lingering on the fringe of collapse, his knees turning to jelly. However, he didn’t fall to his knees but was firmly supported by a hand, half carried and half held up. His head dizzy and his eyes blurred, his gaze focused upwards. In the murky darkness of the stone corridor, it was impossible to see the face, but a pair of eyes burning with fury and a shining scarlet demon mark shone clearly through the gloom. Tianlang-Jun and Zhuzhi-Lang were already frozen from ankle to neck, posed standing in the center of two ice sculptures coiled with black energy. After Luo Binghe strode into the hall, threads of ice-cold white energy crawled up along his black boots, but were mercilessly trodden into pieces. He rushed those two ice structures, giving each a strike. Cracks snaked along the surface of the solid ice. Half-leaning on the stone wall, Shen Qingqiu said, “It’s no use, it’s not an easy task to break crystal ice after it’s already formed. Also, you won’t be able to harm the people inside by hitting it this way. We better take advantage of this opportunity and escape the Holy Mausoleum while they’re sealed up.” Luo Binghe suddenly turned, walking towards him again. Suddenly seeing Luo Binghe again, Shen Qingqiu was both alarmed and happy. He was planning on going back to the stone coffin to fetch him, but he never thought he’d already be awake. He was just going to blurt out a “How are you feeling”, when he discovered that Luo Binghe seemed to be in quite a fit of anger. Luo Binghe said in a stern voice, “Didn’t I tell you not to associate with them?” This sentence was spoken in almost a roar. Shen Qingqiu was alreadydizzy, and being yelled at until his eardrums ached was like a basin of cold water to the face. After standing there dumbly for a moment, he suddenly felt a mysterious wisp of fire erupt in his heart. He said, blandly, “Are you alright?” Luo Binghe’s tone was still somewhat uncharitable. “Alright? What alright?” Seeing him full of vitality, he was most likely fine 227 . This being the case, he’d, at last, managed to repay a little favor to Luo Binghe 228 . Shen Qingqiu nodded. “Then that’s good.” Turning around, he picked a random direction and walked off. Actually, he didn’t know where he was going either. To exit the Holy Mausoleum, the Xin Mo sword and Luo Binghe were both indispensable, without either one you could only randomly wander around the inside. But, he had risked his life to drag him this far and got a face full of yelling as a result. It would be pointless to stay there and sulk. He hadn’t walked a few steps when the energy-draining candles suddenly lit up. The faint candlelight illuminated his side profile. Luo Binghe suddenly reached out to pull on him. “Are you crying?” Shen Qingqiu stared blankly. Is he crying? Is he crying? How is that possible? Shen Qingqiu raised his left hand to check his face. Earlier on, this one intact hand was occupied keeping a firm hold on Luo Binghe, and only now did was there an opportunity to use it for something else. Upon feeling his face, at some time he really had unknowingly begun to cry, his cheeks streaming with tears. Shen Qingqiu suddenly realized, these were the tears of pain he cried when he had pulled the QingSi from his leg. How unsightly. The anger that had just been in Luo Binghe’s voice disappeared without a trace. He said tensely, “So to say, when I heard Shizun crying earlier, it wasn’t fake?” Shen Qingqiu flew into a rage out of humiliation. “Crying, what crying, I don’t know!” He shook him off and walked away right after he finished speaking. Luo Binghe hurriedly grabbed him from behind. Damn it, he just happened to grabthe right arm where the QingSi had taken root. Shen Qingqiu managed to keep himself from shrieking, but still let out a stifled groan. Luo Binghe let go immediately, only leading him by his left hand and inspecting him under the candlelight. The more he looked, the more apprehensive his expression grew. Right now there wasn’t any place on Shen Qingqiu’s body that was safe to look at. He was nothing but a lump of wounds and blood, seriously a spectacle too horrible to endure. Luo Binghe remembered that before he lost consciousness, Shen Qingqiu was clearly in perfect condition. His voice shook. “This… was all for… me?” Shen Qingqiu was going to start spitting blood. If not him, then who? He couldn’t say this sort of thing, and he always disliked making a big deal of bestowing affection and showing scars in the past, so he could only spit out four words: “Your hand, let go.” Luo Binghe changed his face in the blink of an eye, softening. “I won’t let go. Shizun, don’t be mad, I was wrong.” How many times has he said this! Shen Qingqiu waved him aside. Hurry up and go go go, the blind corpses are already encircling us, what are we doing here blocking the path. Having been sent off, Luo Binghe once again latched on to him like sticky candy 229 , you couldn’t even pry him off. “Shizun, why don’t you hit me? You can beat me up to vent your anger, how about that?” Someone come help me, there’s an incurable M here, who can come lock him up They flew across the ground, but Luo Binghe was wrapped around him the whole way. Shen Qingqiu was already familiar with Luo Binghe’s set of moves, he knew he was open to coaxing but not coercion 230 . After wearing him down for quite a while, Shen Qingqiu said helplessly, “You’ve always been like this, crying and admitting your faults but you’ll die before you change your ways. What use is it?” At this point, Luo Binghe was almost sobbing. “Won’t it be enough if I change my ways? Shizun, don’t abandon me.” Seeing him in this good-for-nothing state, if not for the fact that he was still worrying about the bumps he left earlier Shen Qingqiu really wanted to give him a few smacks on the head. Was there something wrong with his teaching methods? How did he raise a crybaby? Luo Binghe, the demon king incarnate, likes to hang on to his Shizun’s clothes and wail when there’s no one around  ifhe were to tell about this who would fucking believe it? Ning Yingying wasn’t even this much of a crybaby! Shen Qingqiu almost couldn’t bear it. “Who’s abandoning you? Ah?” Luo Binghe said, “After I lost consciousness, I still had a remnant of awareness left, I was fighting with all my might to wake up. But just when I managed to wake, I found myself lying in a coffin, and Shizun had run off to who knows where. I lost myself to anger for a while and I thought I had been abandoned, Shizun I thought you would rather go with them and didn’t want to pay attention to me…” Waking up to find you’d been “abandoned” in a coffin, this feeling indeed would not be very good. Shen Qingqiu sighed, weighing his guilty conscience. Luo Binghe continued, “Just now, I didn’t do it on purpose. I don’t know why, obviously I didn’t actually believe it, I didn’t want to say that sort of thing, but in front of Shizun, I never could control myself. I know I’m being embarrassing and losing face, but knowing that Shizun never threw me away but was protecting me all along, that I wasn’t just dreaming this whole time, I’m so happy…” Who is it that’s being embarrassing and losing face? Two grown men, rolled into a ball wiping snot and drying tears, both are being embarrassing, both are losing face, don’t you know? Likely because he was too happy and couldn’t get out any more flowery language, Luo Binghe could only keep repeating “happy”, “glad”, these two simple words. Shen Qingqiu’s face twitched a couple of times. Rubbing his temples, he heaved a long deep sigh. Whatever. This wouldn’t be the first time. The Dream Demon even said that this kid would pull exactly this sort of disgusting behavior, acting like a cool blackened demon lord in front of your face then twisting handkerchiefs and crying behind your back, even arguing with him over things. That said, he himself was also senseless enough, just then he inexplicably got angry over this small a misunderstanding. There’s not much of a difference between him and this mental case of an unfortunate child, how unlike a proper elder. He slowed down and said, “Then, you really are alright now?” Luo Binghe promptly nodded. “I’m alright.” Just then you were burned so severely, but now you’re completely fine? Shen Qingqiu was quite skeptical and pressed his hand to his forehead, turns out it really was cool and smooth. Shen Qingqiu wanted to retract his hand, but LuoBinghe covered his hand with his own, refusing to let him pull away. His eyes gleamed below their folded palms. This expression was too familiar. This was precisely that look he saw on that perfect little sheep following him around and eating grass every day on Qing Jing Peak, the young ray of sunlight Luo Binghe 231 . Shen Qingqiu’s face was going to turn red under his stare, but he couldn’t bear to tear his hand away by force. Doing such a thing when the other was so happy and colored in excitement would really be giving him a slap on the face. He said, “You’re really completely fine? No dizziness? Your spiritual energy and demonic energy are circulating effectively?” Luo Binghe said, “Quite effective. Very effective. Even more effective than before?” While they were talking, they had already reached a room on the east side of the mausoleum. Luo Binghe pulled his sword and slashed across the screen wall, cutting open a pitch-black rift in space. His broken arm had miraculously healed, his leg was no longer lame, the blood on his face had been wiped neat and clean, the always disobedient Xin Mo sword had been tamed into docile submission. The protagonist’s halo was still that protagonist’s halo, the male protagonist was still that male protagonist. Shen Qingqiu didn’t want to say another word and took the lead through the rift with a “let’s go let’s go” type of gesture. Outside of the Mausoleum, the scene was bathed in light. Without prompting, Luo Binghe reached out a hand to support Shen Qingqiu. As a matter of fact, it really had been a long time since they had had this sort of normal interaction. After this sigh of regret in the bottom of his heart, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t resist shooting a glance at Luo Binghe. He looked very satisfied with himself, looks like he really is “very well”. Fancy that he staked his old life to protect him from everything, but in the end not a trifle of it stuck to Luo Binghe. Turns out the whole time he spent sleeping was to recharge his cheat halo Wave Bye- Bye. Luo Binghe suddenly said, “But, other than hearing Shizun cry…” Shen Qingqiu smiled faintly. “En? Who was crying?” Luo Binghe immediately changed his tune. “Other than hearing someone cry, there was also this strange feeling.” Hearing this, Shen Qingqiu began to feel a bit worried again. Turns out there really were some lingering repercussions? He said quietly, “What sort offeeling?” Luo Binghe shook his head. “I can’t say.” “Does it hurt?” “It doesn’t hurt, it’s very…” He hadn’t finished speaking, his face showing a bewildered expression, looking down at himself. Shen Qingqiu: “…” Sky pillar hello, sky pillar goodbye! This topic couldn’t continue anymore, and they let it drop. TianLang-Jun’s voice drifted up like a deceased soul refusing to disperse. “Peak Lord Shen, why are you so eager to leave? You two nearly overturned this race’s holy land, isn’t leaving like this without leaving anything behind really inexcusable?” With every word, his voice got quite a bit closer. Before long, his figure appeared over the horizon. Shen Qingqiu rolled his eyes. But, it was fortunate enough that the Mo Bei clan’s hundred thousand-year-old ice enchantment would be able to delay those two until they exited the Holy Mausoleum. Earlier, Luo Binghe was not quite pleased when he was not able to shatter them into pieces, but now that they had delivered themselves on a silver platter he was quite satisfied. His knuckles cracking, he fixed a glare on Zhuzhi-Lang, growling, “You dare feed my Shizun your blood.” Zhuzhi-Lang peeked at Shen Qingqiu, an embarrassed look on his face. Tianlang-Jun looked at him and said, “Hey, you really can’t say these words with that sort of expression on your face. Didn’t you also feed Peak Lord Shen your blood? Otherwise, who’s the master of the other set of blood parasites in Peak Lord Shen’s body?” Hearing this, Luo Binghe stiffened, clenching his fists. Shen Qingqiu had just raised the hand holding the Xiu Ya sword when Luo Binghe said softly, “Shizun you don’t need to fight, I’m enough by myself.” And the battle begins! Three pillars of black energy soared churning into the sky like storm winds. Watching the battle as a spectator, Shen Qingqiu was ever more deeply appreciative of the difference between demons and humans. The difference in destructive ability is really too big! In addition, Luo Binghe had not only refilled his cheat halo but also leveled up. A couple of hours ago, he had been viciously beaten up, powerless to return a blow, but now it seems the protagonist’s halo is still securely affixed to his head!As he was watching, a scarlet red bone eagle began to circle the battlefield, lowering its wings, looking for an opportunity to rush into the battle. Luo Binghe, fighting one on two, seemed to not have noticed this newcomer obviously harboring malicious intentions, but Shen Qingqiu could see everything clearly. Just as he was going to call out a warning, the bone eagle suddenly swooped down, charging towards the top of Luo Binghe’s head. A sneak attack? Shen Qingqiu held Xiu Ya backward in his hand, and, squinting to take aim, fiercely threw it at his target. The snow-white blade shot out like an arrow, piercing lightning-fast towards the bone eagle. Who would have thought that before he could heave a sigh of relief, the bone eagle’s body didn’t drop, but instead dispersed into a thousand pearls and ten thousand drops, flying towards Shen Qingqiu. On that side, Tianlang-Jun suddenly pulled back, jumping out of the battle with a laugh. Luo Binghe, seeing the bloody pearls scattering through the air, let a panic-stricken expression flash across his face. Shen Qingqiu suddenly realized, Tianlang-Jun had used his own blood to create this bone eagle. He had intentionally sent it to sneak attack Luo Binghe, but the real intent was to draw Shen Qingqiu into playing his hand and shooting it down! Just when he discovered this, he got a face full of bloody rain. Tianlang- Jun smiled faintly, raising his hand to make a sigil in the air. Shen Qingqiu felt his heart slow, like he really had been grabbed in the palm of a giant hand and maliciously squeezed. There was just too much blood, even though he had shut his lips tight a faint taste of rust still appeared on his tongue. Who else but him would be drinking Heavenly Demon’s blood like Red Bull? Who else but him would have drunk three different Heavenly Demons’ blood? Luo Binghe’s eyes were already red with tension, but TianLang-Jun’s blood was already in Shen Qingqiu’s body. He didn’t dare make a rash move, fearing that he would activate the blood parasites. He could only clench his teeth and yell, “Stop!” Zhuzhi-Lang, seeing Shen Qingqiu’s face turn green and then white in succession, couldn’t help but start, “My lord, please forgive this subordinate…” Tianlang-Jun shrugged his shoulders. “Then we’ll have to see what our other young friend will do next.”"
"梦境之地。 竹舍。 屋外疏风穿林，竹叶飒飒。沈清秋坐于案旁 , 双手拢袖 , 定定出神。 简称坐着发呆。 未过多时 , 一阵急促的脚步声传来 , 洛冰河出现在竹舍门口 , 急道： “ 师尊！ ” 他抢进屋里，沈清秋憋了老半天的槽终于一口炸了出来。 沈清秋道： “ 让你给 , 你真给啊？！ ” 洛冰河道： “ 我不给的话，还不知道那魔头要怎么折磨师尊。 ” 还说人家是魔头 , 你自己就是魔头 , 一个大魔头一个小魔头，折腾死人了！ 沈清秋耐心道： “ 我一没叫二没喊，怎么就值得担心了？我 …… 为师也不是不能忍的人。 ” 时隔多年 , 首次在洛冰河面前重新自称为师，感觉莫名酸爽。 洛冰河看着他，隐隐有悲愤之色在目光中闪动： “ 师尊，你都疼晕过去了，还说不值得担 心？ ” 好不容易能醒来见面，好不容易终于把话说开，却还是迫于无奈，眼睁睁看着人被带走。 若不是顾忌天琅君的血蛊，洛冰河也不至于束手束脚。明明不想拖人后腿，却还是让人受 了牵制。沈清秋心中烦躁： “ 不是你没用。是我不留神，着了他的道。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 师尊被他灌下血液，也是为了帮我的缘故。即便师尊能忍，我却不能忍。那 剑他要就给他了，又不是什么大不了的东西。 ” 沈清秋给他跪了。 什么叫 “ 不是什么大不了的东西 ” ？那可是你的金手指啊！！！ 话到嘴边，他迅速改了口： “ 你有没有考虑过，心魔剑落入旁人手里的后果？魔界，北疆 ，人界，苍穹山，都会是他摧毁的对象。 ” 他在挑明利害，洛冰河却又郁郁起来： “…… 师尊生气我把心魔给了他，只是因为害怕牵 连苍穹山派？ ” …… 这孩子怎么就不明白？ 他说不要你的肉身只要你的剑，你信他？ 有这么甜吗？万一他拿了剑翻脸不认人怎么办？ 担心苍穹山派和担心洛冰河，这二者并不矛盾啊！ 洛冰河这一句话给人的感觉，就像那些整天抓着男人问 “ 你到底爱不爱我、你更爱你的事 业还是更爱我 ” 的小女孩儿一样，不知道思考究竟是什么回路。 跟这孩子怎么说也说不通，没三两句又纠结起来了。沈清秋正干捉鸡，谁知，洛冰河反倒 先告状了： “ 跟师尊总是说不明白。 ” 沈清秋负手而立，深吸一口气。 双方都觉得跟对方无法沟通，还能不能好了。代沟，这就是代沟！ 洛冰河忽道： “ 师尊是知道我心意的吧。 ” 话题转到这个上面来，沈清秋僵了一下，感觉头大了几分。 他最不擅长应对这种场合了。 洛冰河说： “ 这竹舍，是我梦中美景。每当我心烦意乱时，来到这里，就能很快平静下 来。 ” 就是他偷偷抹眼泪哭的地方吗 …… 洛冰河缓缓道： “ 清静峰学艺那段日子，是我一生之中最快乐的时光。 ” 他说这句时，神情和尾音都柔和至极，沈清秋看在眼里，心尖仿佛被戳了一下，连在心里 吐槽都不好意思了。 因为，这真是一个人将某物视若珍宝、爱如性命神情所能达到的极致。 任谁也不忍心轻笑置之。 洛冰河的手指轻轻拂过被打磨的光滑无比的绿竹桌面，低声说： “ 刚刚入苍穹山派的时候 ，我很开心，也很惶恐，想着从今往后，一定要勤勉努力。拜入清静峰座下，师尊一开始 对我并不在意。 ” “ 可我更记得，第一次送伤药给我的是师尊，第一次让我上马车，给我准备房间，耐心教 我剑法，暗地里偷偷维护 …… 这些全都是师尊。 ” 沈清秋默默听着，忽然发现，一直以来，他都忽略了另外一面。 洛冰河并非只是个单纯记仇的人。 固然仇恨之人他会千倍奉还，可旁人对他的好，他更会牢牢烙刻在心里。每一件，每一点 滴，沈清秋自己不以为意，有些都完全没印象了，他却清清楚楚铭记在心。 记得，当然是件好事，可这份心思要是能不歪，就更好了 …… 洛冰河撤回落在竹案上的手，忽然朝他迈出一步。沈清秋条件反射道： “ 你冷静。 ” 这时候要是他的折扇在手就好了，扇呼扇呼，给两人都冷静一下。洛冰河还算听他话，脸 上勉强保持了冷静： “ 师尊可知道，我为什么总也对你冷静不下来？ ” 沈清秋是真猜不到，只得默不作声。 洛冰河说： “ 师尊曾问我，是不是无论遭受什么样的苦楚折磨，都能忍受。 ” 沈清秋： “ ？ ” 好像是有过。 他说： “ 不错？ ” 洛冰河道： “ 不错，我能忍。旁人无论如何，我都可以毫不在乎。可这苦楚折磨，不能是 你给我的！ ” 一千个一万个人都可以对他不好，无所谓。但是只有一个人，不能够对他不好！ 他的意思表达的非常明确，眼神更是毫不收敛，灼烧的火焰般死死锁定沈清秋。沈清秋简 直快招架不住了。 他说： “ 你先放一放 ……” 这种时候应该谈正事不对吗？谈一谈怎么取回被抢走的金手指， 818 洛冰河的两个 jp 亲戚 ，猜一猜天琅君要送给人界的礼物，这些要如何应对，还有沈清秋体内的三道血该怎么解 决。 洛冰河却铁了心的不要谈正事。他执拗地道： “ 除非一切从头来过，师尊你从头到尾就不 要为我做这些，不收我为徒，不三番两次救我，不悉心教导我，不要给我任何希望。事到 如今，你还怎么让我放弃？ ” 如果说来，倒像是沈清秋不负责任了！ 他刚伸出手，想给洛冰河顺一顺毛，就被一把拽住，拉到跟前。 沈清秋： “…… 喂。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 师尊要是讨厌我这么做，就揍我，砍我，杀我。我从来不还手，你知道的。 ” 他说完，垂下眼睫，喉结颤了颤，俯首把头凑近了些。 似是十分紧张，生怕被拒绝，连嘴唇也在轻轻发抖。 沈清秋无奈了。 明明是他钳制着沈清秋，为什么反而是用强的那个看上去更无助？ 竹林绿舍、空山鸟语无影无踪。 沈清秋一骨碌爬了起来。 空气甚干，喉咙发痒。他身旁蹲着个黑皮肤的魔族少女，一见他坐了起来，口音浓重地冲 外边叫道： “ 醒啦！ ” 天琅君一只手掀起帘子，探头进来看了看，挑眉： “ 睡得真够久的。 ” 这梦醒的太是时候了！ 不然洛冰河那小子不知道什么时候才会把他放出来。他叼住了就会衔死不放的！ 沈清秋抹了把脸。燥风吹得纱帘乱舞，外界景象漏入车中。 他现在躺在一只黑鳞巨蛇上方，巨蛇背着一座华台，平稳地在地上爬动。 四周分散着大大小小各式全兽、半兽形态的魔族，汇成一支杂乱却规模宏大的军队，正在 前行。 沈清秋判断，这里应该是魔界南疆。 北疆是漠北君的地盘，现在则成了洛冰河的地盘，人型魔族偏多，攻法。只有南疆才会兽 型魔族和杂交种多，跟动物世界似的。 不知道天琅君带着这群魔族要迁移到什么地方去。又打算做什么。 沈清秋观察环境完毕，忽然发现，右胸膛、整条手臂还在隐隐发疼发麻，而且略感迟钝不 灵便。 沈清秋深吸一口气，做好十二分充足的心理准备，低头一看。 …… 草。情况比他预想的还要严重。 他就像被接了一条树枝草叶做的假肢，密密爬满了绿色的肉芽肉叶，随着轻微的肢体动作 簌簌颤动。五指麻木，连蜷曲手指都做不到。 他只看了一眼就不忍心看了。修雅剑就在手边，真特么想拿起来把这只手剁掉。 这时，竹枝郎拿着一只袅袅冒烟的小金炉走近。沈清秋警惕道： “ 你干什么？ ” 竹枝郎道： “ 在下只是想帮沈仙师 ……” 沈清秋立刻比了个 “ 暂停 ” 的手势。他最怕竹枝郎说这种话。他算是领教了，蛇的报恩就是 塞了他满口的天魔之血。竹枝郎苦口婆心道： “ 请相信在下。情丝一天不除七次以上，残 根会一直留在血肉里。今天才拔过三次，现在正是紧要关头，拔不出来沈仙师这条胳膊就 留不住了。 ” 一听有残疾危险，沈清秋立刻把胳膊奉上。 竹枝郎从小金炉中取出一块烧得通红的炭石，赤手拿着，面不改色，啪的一下按到沈清秋 胸前。 沈清秋： “……” 他就知道不能够期待竹枝郎的 “ 帮助 ” 是正常方式。 这炭石压在他胸前的情丝芽上，烧得芽叶枯萎翻卷，烫到根子里，烧得沈清秋有龇牙咧嘴 的冲动，碍于那样太难看，他绷着脸强忍了。 等到竹枝郎把冒出绿芽的部位挨个烫遍，这条胳膊，好歹是暂时能看了。 竹枝郎收回炭石，道： “ 下午还要再烧三次。 ” 沈清秋把刚才解下的外衣拉上肩膀，竹枝郎无意中瞅了一眼，忙不迭低下头。 天琅君在外笑道： “ 你害羞什么？ ” 对啊，沈清秋也想问，你害羞个什么？对着刚刚还肉芽丛生的胸膛和手臂，有什么好害羞 的？ 竹枝郎一本正经道： “ 君上不要取笑属下。属下对沈仙师绝对没有非分之想。 ” 他看着沈清秋，强调道： “ 没有洛冰河那种非分之想。 ” 你强调个什么劲儿啊？！ 竹枝郎匆匆带着小炉跳下蛇背，回到下面，指挥调整队伍去了。沈清秋风中凌乱一阵，目 光开始四下乱转，到处搜索。 心魔剑 …… 心魔剑 …… 心魔剑在哪儿呢？ 哦，在外边儿天琅君座旁呢。扔脚边那柄就是。 沈清秋为之绝倒。 也太随便了！ 人家好歹是第一奇剑！就这么乱扔真的好吗？！ 天琅君原本正托腮眺望远处，注意到沈清秋的怪异表情，问道： “ 沈峰主在看什么？ ” 顿了顿，顺着他目光下望： “ 看我这把剑？ ” 沈清秋淡淡地道： “ 那是洛冰河的剑。 ” 天琅君无所谓地笑了笑，道： “ 沈峰主，有句话，我一直很想问你。 ” 沈清秋： “ 请。 ” 你尽管问，我胡乱答。 天琅君道： “ 你和我儿子，双修过没有？ ”","CHAPTER 63: A TRIP TO THE SOUTH The three different types of ancient demon blood were storms colliding within Shen Qingqiu’s body, locked together in a tangled web that was impossible to separate. Among them, Luo Binghe’s blood was holding together Shen Qingqiu’s five organs 232 and protecting the veins connecting them. It suppressed Zhuzhi-Lang’s blood, while just barely managing to contend with Tianlang-Jun’s. Alone, it tried to cover all three duties, facing off against its two enemies. This all inevitably took a great toll upon it. It would actually be best to let go of Tianlang-Jun’s poisonous blood, for there was absolutely nothing he could do. He turned to Luo Binghe and spoke. “Think carefully about this. If it continues like this, who do you think is going to fall first?” Luo Binghe’s eyes shone with a deep set worry, but a sense of helplessness began growing more and more. Finally, he backed off and replied, “You leave first!” Tianlang-Jun didn’t have the slightest intention of graciously stepping aside for the younger man before him and said instead, “You first.” Luo Binghe instantly replied. “Fine.” Tianlang-Jun wore an inscrutable smile as he spoke. “Sure enough…” He turned towards Zhuzhi-Lang and said, “What to do… I don’t know why whenever I see them, there’s always this extremely unpleasant feeling that fills my heart.” Zhuzhi-Lang nodded silently. Shen Qingqiu knew this wouldn’t end well for him, but he didn’t want to drag anyone else down with him. His whole life, he’d always hated the kind of characters that just ended up becoming bargaining chips for others. If that was the kind of flimsy, delicate character role he was forced to play, he’d rather die. He clutched his hand over his heart and forced his face to remain neutral as he spoke. “Whatever Your Excellency would like to do to me, please, feel free. As you’ve said, after being forced to drink so many times, I should be getting used to it. But don’t even think about seeking the flesh of Luo Binghe. Luo Binghe, if you agree to him, I will strike you down myself with the force of the heavens.” Luo Binghe protested, angrily but helplessly. “Shizun…” “You shut up,” Shen Qingqiu said. Tianlang-Jun stared at him strangely. “Who said I wanted his flesh?”Shen Qingqiu was left speechless. Tianlang-Jun continued. “He can’t compare to my own noble, handsome figure, so why would I want his flesh?” Who said you were more handsome than him? Who put their seal of approval on this? As penned by Airplane Shooting Towards The Sky himself, from heaven to hell, throughout every age known to man, there was none that could ever compare to Luo Binghe. Whether young or old, everyone universally agreed on this number one most handsome man, okay? Shen Qingqiu’s entire expression sunk in exasperation. “Then what exactly do you want 233 ?” Zhuzhi-Lang replied, “Junshang desires that sword.” Tianlang-Jun confirmed, “That’s correct. I would like to present a gift to the human world, but I won’t be able to without that sword.” Heh, so you want the protagonist’s golden finger? Shen Qingqiu’s entire mind was filled with thoughts of “keep dreaming” and “you overestimate your own strength.” He could only watch on as Luo Binghe raised his hand and Zhuzhi-Lang lifted his arm in response. In that instant, the exchange was complete. It passed over like a storm, swiftly and decisively, without the slightest hesitation! Luo Binghe demanded. “Now hand him over!” Zhuzhi-Lang immediately transformed into a serpent and caught Shen Qingqiu in his massive mouth. Tianlang-Jun leaped up gracefully, laughing loudly as he rose. “You really believed that? Hahahahahaha.” The way he was acting right now was truly shameless. It was like an adult making a promise to trade with a child, taking away their toys, then turning around and pretending no such thing happened. Shen Qingqiu suddenly felt quite indignant on behalf of Luo Binghe, who was clearly being bullied. Even with the threat of a sharp fang right next to him, he couldn’t help but ask pointedly, “You do know you’re the adult here, right?” Tianlang-Jun sat straight on Zhuzhi-Lang’s head and replied in that refined tone. “I know that I am a demon. I’m afraid that Peak Lord Shen’s disciple tarried far too long in the human realm and forgot that we demons have never committed to keeping our promises. Of course, most of the time you guys don’t do much more than pay some lip service to it either.” With that final sentence, Tianlang-Jun’s smile vanished from his lips. Shen Qingqiu’s vision went dark. Something hot and red pulsed about, pressingin on him from all sides, as if trapping him inside a tiny pocket. He was swallowed by Zhuzhi-Lang. When he woke, the air around him was dry and his throat felt scratchy. As Shen Qingqiu rolled and sat up, he saw a dark-skinned demon girl next to him. When she noticed him waking, she shouted loudly in a heavily accented voice, “He’s awake!” Tianlang-Jun lifted the curtains with one hand and peered in. He lifted his eyebrows. “Peak Lord Shen has certainly slept long enough.” Shen Qingqiu kept his expression carefully blank as he wiped his face, making sure that there was no trace of reptile stomach juices remaining on him. The dry wind blowing outside made the curtains wave about wildly, allowing glimpses of the scenery outside of the carriage. He was now lying on top of a massive, black-scaled snake. This massive snake was carrying a pavilion on its back as it slithered smoothly across the ground. Surrounding them were many beasts, large and small, as well as many demons with half-beastly forms. Together, these creatures merged into a chaotic but grand-scale army as they marched forwards. Shen Qingqiu determined this was most likely the southern part of the demon world. The north once belonged to Mobei-Jun but was now Luo Binghe’s territory. There, most of the demons had humanoid forms. The most beastly demons and half-beast hybrids were only common in the south, like some kind of animal kingdom. He didn’t know where Tianlang-Jun was planning to lead this group of demons. Or what he was planning to do. After he finished observing his surroundings, Shen Qingqiu suddenly realized that the right side of his chest and his entire arm were still throbbing painfully and seemed to be moving rather sluggishly. He took a deep breath and mentally prepared himself so that he was 120% ready for whatever he might see. Then he looked down. The problem was even more serious than he thought. Like a prosthetic limb made of leaves and branches, every inch of his right arm was covered in green, fleshy leaves and sprouts, trembling slightly along the limb with every motion. All five fingers were completely numb, and he couldn’t even curl them. After only a glance, he couldn’t bear to look at it any longer. The Xiu Ya sword was right beside him, and he was sorely tempted to just pick it up and hack the arm off entirely. Just then, Zhuzhi-Lang approached, holding a small,steaming gold stove. Shen Qingqiu jumped as if he’d seen a ghost, instantly on high alert. “What are you doing?” Zhuzhi-Lang froze in place. “This subordinate just wanted to help Master Shen…” Shen Qingqiu immediately began pointing towards his own mouth. This was the type of thing he was most scared of hearing from Zhuzhi-Lang. He’d already had his taste of a snake’s gratitudehe was so grateful that he swallowed him whole in the end. Zhuzhi-Lang raised his trailing sleeves towards his face in a rather embarrassed gesture, as if trying to cover his own mouth. He then quickly put them down and tried to persuade Shen Qingqiu in the most heartfelt manner. “Master Shen, you have to believe me. If the QingSi is not removed at least seven times a day, the roots will be buried deep inside your flesh. But they’ve only been plucked three times today. It’s the most critical moment right now. If we do not remove them now, then I’m afraid we will not be able to save Master Shen’s arm.” When he heard that he’d be in danger of losing a limb, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t hesitate any longer no matter what shadows of reservation he was still holding in his heart. He immediately placed his arm out. Zhuzhi-Lang took out a burning red lump of coal from the stove. Then, holding it in his bare hands, he pressed it right up against Shen Qingqiu’s chest. “…” Shen Qingqiu was silent. He knew he shouldn’t have expected Zhuzhi-Lang’s “help” to be anything normal or sensible. The piece of coal pressed against the QingSi sprouts on his chest, causing them to wither and curl as they burned to their roots. It was so horrifying Shen Qingqiu had to resist the urge to grimace at the sight. Only when Zhuzhi-Lang finally managed to burn off all the green shoots, one by one, could he finally stand to look at his arm again. Zhuzhi-Lang withdrew the piece of coal and said. “In the afternoon and evening, they’ll need to be burned three more times.” Shen Qingqiu pulled his robes back over his shoulders. Zhuzhi-Lang unconsciously glanced up, then quickly turned his gaze down again. Outside, Tianlang-Jun laughed. “Silly child, what are you embarrassed about?” He’s right, Shen Qingqiu thought to himself. What do you have to be embarrassed about? Seeing this chest that was just covered in fleshy sprouts all over? Seeing this being that you just swallowed whole? What is there left to be embarrassed about?Zhuzhi-Lang answered completely seriously. “My lord, please don’t mock this subordinate. I do not have the slightest of intentions towards Master Shen.” He looked towards Shen Qingqiu and re-emphasized, “Absolutely none of Luo Binghe’s intentions.” Why are you emphasizing that at me? Zhuzhi-Lang quickly took his stove and leaped off the snake’s back, returning down below to direct the troops marching about. Shen Qingqiu’s mind was a mess, his eyes beginning to dart quickly about, searching desperately. The Heart Devil sword… where was it… where was the Heart Devil sword? Oh, it was outside, lying next to Tianlang-Jun’s seat. Thrown right down next to his feet. Shen Qingqiu was about to roll over in laughter. This was the number one, most infamous sword of the Proud Immortal Demon Way , the ultimate trump weapon on both heaven and earth. Was it something that should be thrown about so carelessly like this? Tianlang-Jun was resting his chin in his hand, observing the scene in the distance. When he noticed Shen Qingqiu’s expression, he asked, “Peak Lord Shen, what are you looking at?” He followed his gaze downwards. “At this sword of mine?” Shen Qingqiu answered calmly, “That is Luo Binghe’s sword.” Tianlang-Jun laughed it away easily and said, “Peak Lord Shen, there’s something I’ve always wanted to ask you.” Shen Qingqiu replied, “Please.” You can ask whatever you want, and I’ll just answer randomly. Tianlang-Jun asked, “You and my son, have the two of you cultivated as partners 234 ?” Shen Qingqiu was sure he heard wrong. “What did you say?” Tianlang-Jun patiently repeated himself, “I was asking Peak Lord Shen whether you and Luo Binghe…” Shen Qingqiu’s face twitched several times and he immediately put up his hand in a gesture to “stop.” Tianlang-Jun continued. “Or perhaps Peak Lord Shen doesn’t understand what I mean by cultivating as partners? It means that…” Shen Qingqiu interrupted. “That’s enough.” Could you have some sense of shame at least? Shen Qingqiu forced himself to remain calm. “Why would you believe that he and I have…cultivated together?”Tianlang-Jun replied. “To be honest, I’ve always yearned to know more about the culture and customs of the human world.” “So?” How did yearning for human culture have anything to do with the question? Tianlang-Jun held out a finger and shook it a few times to silence him. Then he hummed out a soft, charming little melody. Shen Qingqiu was proud to hold himself as a proper gentleman, always in total control of his expressions. But the longer Tianlang-Jun continued humming, the harder it became to maintain his cold, dignified front. God! Damn! Resentment! Of! Chunshan! How did it become popular even in the Demon Realm! Tianlang-Jun hummed a full two verses before he was finally satisfied but still seemed to want to continue. “Only the illustrious spirit of the human world could produce such a stunning masterpiece. The boldly audacious plot line, the deep romanticism in each phrase, these are truly worthy of the highest praise. Especially at the end of every verseit leaves you with a teaser, making it impossible for you to put down and leaving you eagerly awaiting more.” Oh wow, the damn thing was still being serialized! Shen Qingqiu suddenly realized, “Wait. Back when we first met in the Holy Mausoleum, you said ‘I have long awaited the honor of meeting you.’” Could it be that this was the “long awaited honor” he was referring to? It was a reference to this bawdy love song? Tianlang-Jun replied with joy, “Indeed, that’s exactly what I was referring to.” System: Chatting with the BOSS about interests and hobbies, increasing the villain’s depth of character, B-points +150! This was the most fucking absurd excuse for interests and hobbies! While the two of them continued to stare at each other, the young dark- skinned demon girl that had been looking after Shen Qingqiu suddenly leaped up cheerfully like an antelope. Shen Qingqiu turned to her and found that she really did have a pair of antelope legs. The girl jumped about, looked up and shouted cheerfully. “My lord! Is the new place we’re going to very nice?” Tianlang-Jun smiled and waved back at her. “Naturally, it will be the best place.” The young girl asked rather innocently, “Is there a lot of water there?” Tianlang-Jun replied. “The rivers flow freely across every plain andmountain, covering all the lands beneath the open sky.” The girl cheered and leaped off into the distance. Shen Qingqiu watched as she left, contemplating the rather uneasy feeling he was getting. “Where are you taking them to?” Tianlang-Jun replied in his unhurried manner, “Peak Lord Shen has already drawn his own conclusions, no? Why ask for what you already know?” Rivers through plains and mountains… these clearly weren’t landforms belonging to the Demon Realm. This “nice place” was undoubtedly the human world. Shen Qingqiu spoke, “Judging by the numbers alone, at least 20% of the demons of the south must be traveling in this group right now. Your Excellency, do you think such a group of such massive size will be able to simply cross the border without the cultivators noticing?” Tianlang-Jun replied, “Who said I was planning to cross over the border?” He straightened up and gave him a disdainful laugh. “What do you think I wanted this sword for?” Shen Qingqiu replied, “You’re planning to use the Heart Devil sword to open a crack between the two worlds?” Tianlang-Jun corrected him. “To be accurate, it will be a merging of the two worlds.” Merging the Human and Demon Realms!"
"沈清秋以为自己听错了： “ 你说什么？ ” 天琅君耐心地重复了一遍： “ 我问沈峰主 , 你和洛冰河 , 双修过没有？ ” 沈清秋脸皮抽搐了几下。天琅君道： “ 还是沈峰主不明白我所指双修的意思？意思就是 ……” 沈清秋： “ 够了。 ” 能要点脸吗？！ 沈清秋强作镇定 ,“ 你为什么会觉得，我跟他双修过？ ” 天琅君道： “ 实不相瞒，我对人界的民俗文化 , 风土人情一直都很向往呢。 ” 沈清秋： “ 所以？ ” 向往人界的风土人情 , 跟这个问题有半毛钱的关系？ 天琅君伸出一只手指 , 摇了两下，轻声哼唱了一段旖旎绵软的小调。 沈清秋先是面无表情，然而，天琅君越是哼下去，他的冷傲神情越是绷不下去。 我！去！泥！煤！的！春！山！恨！ 怎么它原来已经流行到了魔界吗！！！ 天琅君哼了整整两段 , 心满意足 , 意犹未尽： “ 也只有人杰地灵的人界才能孕育出这样一部惊 世巨作。实在精彩的很，尤其是每每结尾之处，留个钩子，让人欲罢不能，对下一作满载 期待。 ” 哦草原来这特么还是连载的？！ 沈清秋： “…… 等等。圣陵里第一次见面，你说了一句 ‘ 久仰 ’ 。 ” 难道就是这个 “ 久仰 ” ？在小黄曲里的久仰？ 天琅君欣然道： “ 正是这个 ‘ 久仰 ’ 的意思。 ” 系统：【与 boss 进行兴趣爱好交流，反派形象立体化， b 格 +150 ！】 见鬼的兴趣爱好！ 两人正大眼瞪小眼，那照顾沈清秋直到他醒来的黑皮肤魔族少女从下方奔过，欢快的像一 只羚羊。沈清秋定睛一看，发现她真的长着一双羚羊腿。那少女一跳一跳的，仰脸大声问 道： “ 君上！咱们要去的新地方，很好很好吗？ ” 天琅君笑着冲她挥回了手： “ 那自然是极好的。 ” 那少女一派天真，问道： “ 水多吗？ ” 天琅君道： “ 河流山川，遍布天下。 ” 那少女欢呼一声，蹦向远方。沈清秋望着她的背影，琢磨着不对味儿： “ 你要把他们迁去 什么地方？ ” 天琅君悠悠道： “ 沈峰主心中已有定论，又何必明知故问？ ” 河流山川，根本不是魔族的常见地貌。 “ 好地方 ” ，无疑是指人界。沈清秋说： “ 看数量，南疆恐怕超出两成的魔族都聚集在这支 队伍里。阁下以为，如此浩大的规模穿越边境之地，修真界会注意不到么？ ” 天琅君道： “ 谁说一定要穿越边境之地？ ” 他直起上身，笑了： “ 你以为我想要这把剑来做 什么？ ” 沈清秋觉得，他不光猜不准男主的心思，男主他爹的心思也猜不准，所以他干脆不猜，这 次直接问了出来： “ 你要用心魔剑，在两界之中斩出裂口？ ” 天琅君补充道： “ 准确地说，是把两界合并。 ” 合并人界与魔界！ 不就相当于把异次元揉碎、揉成一团？ 沈清秋并不觉得这个想法匪夷所思，相反，他肯定，只要有心魔剑在手，绝对能办到这件 听上去仿佛荒唐臆想的事情。 因为，这是有原著依据的！ 两界合并，正是原著临近大结局时，洛冰河为彻底统一魔界与修真界所做的一件丧心病狂 的事。 原先沈清秋总认为，原著的 “ 洛冰河 ” 是他最熟悉的。可现在想起，竟觉得这个角色离自己 十分遥远，很是陌生。 那个 “ 洛冰河 ” ，毫不关心这么做会带来的毁灭性后果。他的理由是两界分离不利统治，而 且资源不平衡，魔族那帮老婆和小弟天天吵吵嚷嚷，闹得他心烦，干脆就给合并了，方便 管理。 沈清秋沉声道： “…… 这就是你要送的 ‘ 礼物 ’ ？未免恶意太大了。 ” 天琅君摸了摸下巴，温文道： “ 我真的没有恶意。我很喜欢人界，让两族更密切地交流一 番，是我一直以来的愿望。 ” 沈清秋挑眉道： “ 天琅君是真没想到还是根本不在意？魔族能适应人界，人族非修真者又 有多少能适应魔界的？换句话说， ” 他有选择地咬重字眼： “ 就算你 ‘ 喜欢 ’ 人，可你能保证 所有魔族都喜欢？两界从古以来便处相离状态，这样都纷争无数，如果贸然合并，更别想 有一天安生了。 ” 天琅君无奈道： “ 沈峰主果真是四大派出来的人，都是这么个调调。我也不想这么仓促。 但事到如今，我只好一不做二不休，先合并了再说。慢慢地来，总会磨合的。 ” 天大的事在他口里只是 “ 仓促 ” 。最后一句话的逻辑其实等于 □□ 一事，奸着奸着，对象总 会配合的，先奸了再说。 沈清秋忍不住问： “ 你和苏夕颜 …… 莫非也只是为了 ‘ 两族密切交流 ’ ？ ” 天琅君轻轻叹了口气： “ 夕颜啊。她当然很好。我喜欢她。 ” 他语气一转，摊手道： “ 可是 她已经死了。 ” 因为死了，所以就毫不留恋了？ 说到底，魔族的喜欢，太过薄凉了。 对与之相恋的女子都不过尔尔，对亲儿自然也好不到哪里去。沈清秋默然片刻，道： “ 你 究竟是怎么看洛冰河的？ ” 洛冰河虽然从来一句都不曾提过，可沈清秋知道，他对自己的亲生父母是抱有幻想的。 他只知道自己是名门女子和一名天魔血系的贵族所生，却不知道究竟是哪两个人，哪两个 名字。 他其实一直都有悄悄地想象，如果父母还在，该会对他多好。若是洛冰河知道自己的生父 是这副样子，那些想象，就真的只是可笑的想象了。 天琅君看了他一眼： “ 心疼他？ ” 沈清秋哼了一声。 boss 都中二，果然是天理。只是天琅君情况比较特殊。从前他是天真理想化的中二，总觉 得自己可以拯救全世界、带来两族爱与和平。被压在白露山下这么多年，现在的他，怀揣 的是一份带有不自觉恶意的中二。 必须把天琅君的意图告诉洛冰河，让他想个办法给苍穹山派递个信，至少早作准备。 入夜，烟尘滚滚的大队停驻在一片莽原之上，就地扎营。 需要扎营的其实只是为数不多的人型魔族。兽型魔族幕天席地就好，土坑、树顶、草地， 什么地方都能睡。 沈清秋的休息之处是一顶舒适宽敞的白帐篷，外表简易，内里却应有尽有。竹枝郎亲自布 置完毕，才把他送了进去。 那跟了他一路的魔族少女一走，沈清秋立刻迫不及待躺上床，闭目安睡。等着洛冰河入梦 来。 不知过了多久，忽然感觉月影晃动。沈清秋一睁开眼睛，只见洛冰河半跪在床前。 沈清秋刚说了半句： “ 洛冰河，你听我说 ……” 洛冰河就扑了过来。 沈清秋被他扑了个正着，压回床上，嘴也被一片温软堵得严严实实，连唔唔之声也发不出 来，只能干瞪眼，怒得脸都红了。洛冰河不知收敛，越亲越重，到后来就变成小兽撕咬般 的啃噬。 沈清秋好不容易缓过一口气，骂道： “ 洛冰河！ …… 你发什么疯！ ” 他自己觉得是骂，可几个字出口，上气不接下气，倒像是假嗔。洛冰河怨念道： “ 继续上 次没做完的部分。 ” 还敢提上次上次他是鬼迷心窍了才没踹开洛冰河！上次两个人嘴唇就快碰到一起的时候， 沈清秋就醒了，这时提起，他脸一下子烫熟了。幸好烛火已熄，不然就好看了。 打住。 沈清秋突然发现，现在四周场景，不是清静峰竹舍。 即是说 …… 不是在做梦？！ 他一下子坐了起来。果然，还能看见帐外巡逻魔族小兵的火把之光，也能听见狼嚎牛叫还 有刻意压低的呵斥之声。 洛冰河就站在他帐里，不是站在梦境之地，是他本人来了。 真是 …… 胆大包天！ 沈清秋要吐血了： “ 你疯了！一个人跑过来送上门，南疆起码两成的魔族都在这队伍里， 再加上两个同血系的魔族。万一被发现了，你这是找死！ ” 洛冰河一边给他拍背，一边说： “ 师尊，我不能明着抢人，我怕他催动你体内的血蛊，可 你总不能叫我坐着等。师尊你就别骂我了，我实在是忍不住了！ ” 他现在没有了可以拿来当任意门的心魔剑，横穿北疆过来，少说也有千里之遥。沈清秋就 是想扇他后脑勺，想到这路途迢迢，下手也要斟酌三分。眼见他打蛇随棍上，一条腿这就 压上了床沿，立刻拿出做师父的威严，严词警告： “ 你是不是忘了，为师还什么都没答应 你？ ” 洛冰河振振有词： “ 我上次说过，师尊你要么杀了我，在这里叫一声，外面的丑八怪们就 会围进来。师尊既然不叫，那就是答应我。 ” 这不要脸的，沈清秋给他气得都笑了。想玩二选一，要么杀人要么给操，傻逼才上当，乖 乖从里面选！ 必须得纠正，这厮不是胆大包天，根本是色胆包天。 沈清秋不好踹他，怕踹出太大动静，不断把他脑袋推开，竭力维持一本正经： “ 你进来的 时候，有没有惊动到谁？ ” 男主千军万马中来去自如，那还用怀疑吗？洛冰河道： “ 怎么可能？我要进来，谁也别想 瞧见，只是有一件事需要担心 ……” 他还没说究竟是什么事，忽然从帐外传来一声清咳。 竹枝郎的声音响起： “ 沈仙师？休息了吗？ ” 一听这声音，洛冰河两眼杀气陡生，冷冰冰的横了出去。沈清秋忙按住他，眼色严厉，示 意他别冲动。 洛冰河被他瞪了，不知道怎么回事，反而脸颊染上一层淡红。沈清秋没时间对他这抖 m 性 吐槽了。帐外有魔族兽兵巡逻，帐内又无处可躲，他掀开被子，洛冰河会意，从善如流挤 了进去。 竹枝郎在外自言自语道： “ 这么早就歇下了吗？ ” 对，所以快走！ 帐外静默片刻，沈清秋还以为他走了，正要松一口气，竹枝郎道： “ 那 …… 在下就打扰 啦。 ” 怎么原来睡着没睡着你都是要进来的吗？！ 那还问个屁！！！ 洛冰河露出个脑袋，又气又疑： “ 这蛇趁师尊睡觉要进来干什么？ ” 躲好你的就是了熊孩子！！！ 沈清秋把他脑袋按回去，跳下床叫道： “ 别进来！ ” 竹枝郎果然没进来，困惑道： “ 原来没休息吗？沈仙师刚才为何不答话？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 困了，不想答话。喜之郎你走吧。 ” 竹枝郎愣住了： “ 白日不是说好了吗？ ” 死死死。白天确实说好了，竹枝郎晚上会来给他拔除剩下的情丝！ 洛冰河又露出脸，悄声质问： “ 说好什么？ ” 沈清秋前脚刚把第二床被子堆到他身上，放下床帘，竹枝郎后脚便进帐来了。 他手里拿着那只小金炉，眼睛斜视一旁，道： “ 深夜冒犯，沈仙师还请海涵。只是情丝不 除尽，唯恐多生事端。 ” 进来了再赶出去就太惹人怀疑了，反正竹枝郎出于莫名原因不敢多看他，只能尽量小心 些。 沈清秋挡在床帘前，微笑道： “ 明白，麻烦你了。 ” 竹枝郎客气地道： “ 在下分内之事而已。沈仙师为何不到床上 ……” 他还没走出一步，沈清 秋错身挡在他面前，抓住他手臂，转了个圈。 转到竹枝郎背对床帘，他才说： “ 不上床。就在这里。 ” 竹枝郎莫名其妙被他拖着手臂晃了一圈，也不好发问，只当他一时兴起，好脾气地问： “ 站着？ ” 沈清秋果断道： “ 站着。 ” 竹枝郎： “ 沈仙师受得了？ ” 在他身后，洛冰河猛地掀翻被子，身上杀气腾腾，黑雾勃发。沈清秋权当看不见，目不斜 视： “ 习惯了。 ” 竹枝郎点点头，转身在小桌安置金炉。趁此机会，沈清秋隔空对洛冰河发了一掌，把他打 回被子里，火速将他盖住，竹枝郎转身时，早已各就各位，一切如常无异。 他拿着烧红的炭石说： “ 请沈仙师除下外衣。 ” 沈清秋低头，慢吞吞开始解衣带。他真不敢解快，要是真脱了，洛冰河估计就要拆床拆人 了。 他动作慢的令人发指，竹枝郎等了半天，终于忍不住瞅了一眼： “ 沈仙师可是手指不方 便？可要在下帮忙？ ” 沈清秋见他抬眼，忙猛地一扯衣襟，外衣溜溜地从肩头滑了下去。","CHAPTER 64: RENDEZVOUS IN ENEMY CAMP Wasn’t this the same as crushing all the alternate dimensions together into one giant mass? Shen Qingqiu didn’t think such an idea was inconceivable. On the contrary, he was certain that, so long as one held the Heart Devil sword, this seemingly preposterous notion was absolutely possible. Because this was the basis of the original work! In the finale, the merging of two worlds was exactly what Luo Binghe achieved, as a way to finally unify the realm of demons and cultivation by his own demented design. Before, Shen Qingqiu had always believed that this original “Luo Binghe” was the one he was most familiar with. But thinking on it now, somehow that character seemed very strange and distant. That “Luo Binghe” cared not of the devastation such a plan would leave in its wake. His only reasoning was that two separate realms were rather unfavorable to his regime. Furthermore, the resources were rather unevenly distributed which caused all the demon wives and kids to make such a ruckus every day, annoying him to no end. Finally, he decided he was done with it and just merged everything to make managing it all more convenient. Shen Qingqiu’s voice dropped low. “So this was the ‘present’ you wanted to send? Don’t you think it’s a bit too malicious on your part?” Tianlang-Jun rubbed his chin in contemplation, then spoke in that cultured tone of his. “I really harbor no ill will towards them at allI love the human world very much, and it’s long been a long-cherished wish of mine for deeper communication between the two races.” Shen Qingqiu raised an eyebrow. “Has Tianlang-Jun truly never considered the consequences? Or perhaps you simply don’t care? Even if the demons can adapt to living in the human world, how many non-cultivating humans do you think can adapt to living among demons? Or, in other words,” he chose his next words carefully, “even if you ‘love’ humankind, can you guarantee that all demons agree? The two worlds have been separated since ancient times, but even so, we have had countless disputes. If they were to suddenly merge, I’m afraid that there will not be a single day of peace ahead.” Tianlang-Jun answered rather grudgingly, “Peak Lord Shen is truly one from the Four Great Sectsall of you sing along to the same tune. Perhaps it seems a bit rash, but that is not at all my intention. With failure so close at hand, I must see this through until the end. We will merge first and deal with theaftermath slowly as it comes. In the face of unchangeable circumstances, even those that cannot adapt will eventually learn to accept it.” There really was some kind of law that every BOSS needed to have a bad case of chuunibyou syndrome. But Tianlang-Jun was a bit of a special case. Perhaps he was once the young, naive type of chuuni who imagined himself to be the savior of the world, the one destined to forge love and peace between the two races. But after being crushed beneath Bailu Peak for so many years, he was now the type of chuuni that carried a deep, undying resentment in his heart. Actions that could break heaven and earth were merely “a bit rash.” And that last bit was exactly the kind of logic rapists use: assuming that your partner will relent in the end so you might as well force yourself on them, take what you want, and deal with the consequences later. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but ask, “You and Su Xiyan…could it be that the two of you were just another part of this ‘deeper communication between races’?” When he heard this name, the smooth, easy smile on Tianlang-Jun’s face began sliding off. He turned so that Shen Qingqiu could no longer see his expression. He could only hear him sigh quietly. “Ah Xiyan, she really was…” She really was… what? Shen Qingqiu pondered over that subtle tone of his. Sweet and gentle? Pure and kind? Tianlang-Jun continued, “Cold and ruthless. That was what I loved about her.” Shen Qingqiu was about to roll over with laughter. Tianlang-Jun waved his hand and said, “But it doesn’t matter nowshe’s already dead.” So he didn’t miss her even a bit? Unfortunately, it seemed that a demon’s “love” was rather shallow and cold. Shen Qingqiu remained silent for a moment, then asked, “How do you really feel about Luo Binghe?” Tianlang-Jun glanced over at him. “I…feel rather sorry for him?” Shen Qingqiu could only smile back emptily, unable to reply. Although Luo Binghe had never mentioned a word, Shen Qingqiu knew that deep inside, he often dreamed about what his birth parents would be like. He knew that he was born of a distinguished young woman and a powerful demon noble, but he could never put names or faces to them. So he always secretlyimagined how it would be if they were still there… how tender and warm they would be, and how they would protect him from anyone that looked down on him. If Luo Binghe knew that his birth father was this type of man… one who, on account of his human blood, might not even bother to spare him a glance… then those dreams of his would truly become just laughable figments of his imagination. As night fell, the troops and the billows of smoke surrounding them came to a halt. Upon a wide expanse of grassland, they began setting up camp. The only ones that really needed to set up camp were the few humanoid demons. The beastly ones could get by just fine in the wild. They could sleep in a ditch, in the treetops, on the grass… anywhere at all. Shen Qingqiu had a white tent that was quite spacious and comfortable. Though it looked rather simple from the outside, it had everything he could need within. Zhuzhi-Lang came by personally to make sure all was arranged accordingly and led Shen Qingqiu into the tent. As soon as that demon girl that had been following him the entire time left, Shen Qingqiu immediately collapsed onto his bed in relief. He closed his eyes and waited for the dreamscape to descend. He didn’t know how much time had passed before he suddenly felt the moonlight quiver. Shen Qingqiu opened his eyes and saw Luo Binghe half- kneeling before his bed. “Luo Binghe, listen to me, there’s something very important here” Shen Qingqiu had just begun speaking when Luo Binghe immediately tackled him. He threw himself over Shen Qingqiu, who fell back onto the bed, his mouth sealed shut by a soft warmth on top of him. He couldn’t make the slightest sound and was forced to stare helplessly as his face grew furiously more red by the moment. Luo Binghe had no sense of restraint, and his kisses grew deeper and deeper like he was a small beast trying to devour his prey. Shen Qingqiu finally managed to catch his breath and commanded, “Luo Binghe, kneel properly now!” Luo Binghe lifted the hems of his robes and immediately fell into a perfect kneeling posture. “Do you know why you’re kneeling right now?” Shen Qingqiu asked. Luo Binghe’s back was as straight as a board as he replied. “This one is but a lowly disciple, and yet assaulted Shizun…” Shen Qingqiu chastised him. “Who told you to say that! This master willsettle the matter with you later. Tianlang-Jun told you to hand over the Heart Devil sword and you just went ahead and gave it to him? I don’t remember teaching you to be such a…” Such a naive little girl 235 ! Luo Binghe replied, “I had no choice. Besides, it wasn’t anything particularly important, so why not hand it over?” Wasn’t anything particularly important? This all-powerful treasure that most could cry and sob for but never even glimpse at! Even a mountain of riches couldn’t stand up to the prodigal son. Shen Qingqiu spoke, “Did you stop to think about what he might want the Heart Devil sword for? From the northern reaches of the country to the southern borders, for Cang Qiong Peak and Huan Hua Palace alike, did you consider the type of threat he could pose?” Luo Binghe replied, “Is Shizun is angry at me for handing over the Heart Devil sword out of concern for all these places? Or perhaps it’s just because you’re afraid of involving Cang Qiong Peak?” His tone was rather like that of a petulant young woman, one who was always clinging onto her partner asking, “Do you really love me? Do you love your career more than you love me?” Shen Qingqiu was just about to scold him again on the degree of danger at hand and force him back onto the main topic, but he quickly choked down his words. Through the screen, they could see flickers of torchlight as a patrol of demon guards passed by. And they could hear the howling of the wolves, the rustling of cattle, and the low, angry murmurs of voices. Somehow it seemed like… this wasn’t a dream? That meant… Luo Binghe was standing in his tent, and not just in his dreamscapes. The one in front of him was the man himself! He no longer held the Heart Devil sword that could open a door to anywhere. Crossing the entire northern country to arrive here had to be well over a thousand miles. Even if Shen Qingqiu wanted to give him a good strike to the back of the head with his fan, the mere thought of his journey here was enough to make him hesitate. Luo Binghe took advantage of his hesitation to press one leg up onto his bedside 236 . Shen Qingqiu could almost taste the blood rising into his mouth, but he needed to maintain his dignity as Shizun. “Luo Binghe, ah Luo Binghe. Don’t you think you’re being too arrogant, far too conceited in your audacity? You’ve served yourself up on a silver platter. At least twenty percent of demons of theSouth are here, not to mention two powerful elders of your bloodline. If you’re discovered, you’re as good as dead!” Luo Binghe replied, “Shizun, I couldn’t bear to stand by as you were stolen away. I was afraid he would activate the demonic blood within you. You can’t tell me to just sit there and wait. Shizun, please stop scolding me for this; I truly couldn’t hold back any longer.” Shen Qingqiu kept pushing his head away, trying his best to maintain a serious composure. “When you came in, did you run into anyone?” Luo Binghe replied, “How would that be possible? If I want to get inside, there’s no one that could catch sight of me. There’s just one thing that I’m worried about…” He hadn’t said exactly what he meant when suddenly a cough sounded from outside the tent. Zhuzhi-Lang’s voice carried in. “Master Shen 237 ? Have you turned in already?” As soon as he heard this, Luo Binghe’s eyes suddenly took on a murderous light as he turned towards the sound with an ice-cold glare. Shen Qingqiu was busy holding him down, giving him a stern look that told him not to be rash. He didn’t know what was happening, but Luo Binghe’s face blushed quite red under that look, sending a shiver down his spine. Outside the tent, the demon army was patrolling, and inside the tent, there was nowhere to hide. With little other choice, he lifted the covers and Luo Binghe readily slid in. Outside, Zhuzhi-Lang murmured to himself, “Turning in so early?” There was a moment of silence outside, and Shen Qingqiu, thinking he had left, was about to let out a sigh of relief. Then Zhuzhi-Lang spoke, “Then… this servant will have to disturb your rest.” So regardless of whether I was sleeping or not you were going to come in anyway? Why even bother asking! Luo Binghe peeked out and asked suspiciously, “Why is that snake coming inside while Shizun is sleeping?” Just hide yourself, you little brat! Shen Qingqiu shoved his head back under the covers, leaped out of bed, and called out, “Don’t come in!” Zhuzhi-Lang indeed stopped before coming in and sounded rather perplexed. “So you weren’t sleeping after all? Why did Master Shen not answer before?”Shen Qingqiu replied, “I was sleepy, and didn’t want to reply. Xizhi-Lang, you should go now.” Zhuzhi-Lang was taken aback. “Didn’t we already agree during the day?” Shit. Shit, shit, shit. They had indeed agreed earlier in the day that Zhuzhi- Lang would come by in the evening to help him burn out any remaining trace of QingSi on him! Luo Binghe poked his head out again and questioned him quietly, “What did you agree to?” Shen Qingqiu just managed to stack a second blanket on top of him and drop the drapes around the bed when Zhuzhi-Lang’s foot stepped into the tent. He said, “I apologize for disturbing you so late at night, but please understand. It’s just that if these QingSi are not removed, I fear they may only give rise to greater incidents in the future.” Letting him in or kicking him out were both equally troublesome. Besides, for some reason, Zhuzhi-Lang didn’t dare to meet his eyes for long so he would have to just tread carefully. Shen Qingqiu stepped in front of the drapes, blocking it off from view, then smiled. “Alright, then I’m afraid I’ll have to trouble you.” Zhuzhi-Lang responded politely, “It is only right that I do so. Master Shen, why not use the bed…” He hadn’t even taken a single step forward before Shen Qingqiu moved in front of him, caught his hand, and turned him around. Only after Zhuzhi-Lang’s back had been turned towards the drapes did Shen Qingqiu finally speak. “Not on the bed. Right here is fine.” Having been spun around by the hand for no apparent reason, Zhuzhi- Lang found that he had no good way of asking. After he had recovered his senses, he asked good-naturedly, “Standing up?” Shen Qingqiu replied decisively, “I’ll stand.” Zhuzhi-Lang asked, “Master Shen, will you be okay?” Behind him, Luo Binghe suddenly tore off the blankets, his entire face full of rage. Shen Qingqiu expression didn’t change the slightest. “I’m used to it.” Zhuzhi-Lang nodded, then turned and placed a golden stove on the small table beside them. Taking advantage of the moment, Shen Qingqiu waved a hand and forced Luo Binghe back under the blankets, covering him in an instant. By the time Zhuzhi-Lang turned back around, he was already back to standing as usual, not a single hair out of place. Zhuzhi-Lang took one of the burning red coals out and said, “Master Shen, please remove your overclothes.” Shen Qingqiu lowered his head and began slowly untying his waist sash.He was afraid of moving too quickly. If he actually took it all off, Luo Binghe would likely tear down the bed and Zhuzhi-Lang along with it. He moved slow enough to drive even the most patient man to frustration. After waiting for a long while, Zhuzhi-Lang finally couldn’t help but glance towards him. “Perhaps Master Shen’s fingers are having trouble? Would this one be able to help?” Shen Qingqiu saw his gaze lifting towards him, and hurriedly pulled at the lapels of his robes, the outermost garment sliding easily off his shoulders. By pulling like this, the garment slid down to his feet. He then moved his arm under Zhuzhi-Lang’s gaze, and the man immediately focused all his attention on it, studying it carefully. After an entire day of trying to remove the QingSi, it finally began showing signs of receding. It was no longer covering half of Shen Qingqiu’s chest and arm in thick leaves like it was when he first woke this morning. Now only a few small sprouts remained. Luo Binghe silently threw his palm forwards, sending a massive wave of black Qi towards Zhuzhi-Lang’s back. Shen Qingqiu suddenly waved his hand and smacked the piece of coal right out of Zhuzhi-Lang’s grasp. The coal rolled across the ground and out of the tent. Zhuzhi-Lang, who was smacked for absolutely no reason, was left at a complete loss. Shen Qingqiu explained apologetically, “My hand slipped.” Zhuzhi-Lang accepted this explanation with little inner turmoil and left the tent to go pick it up. He walked about for quite a while, wondering, “Where did it roll to?” Shen Qingqiu immediately leaped onto the bed. Luo Binghe whispered, “Shizun, what kind of life have you been living under them?” The kind where you have nothing to do but wait around helplessly until you die! Shen Qingqiu whispered back, “Don’t mess around. If you’re discovered, we’ll both be in trouble.” After saying that, his hand rose and fell, shoving Luo Binghe back under the blankets. Luo Binghe was not at all placated by this and stewed sullenly. He thought that he could probably put up a fight against Tianlang-Jun now, but each day the demonic blood remained within Shizun was another day he was forced to hold back. He beckoned with his finger and the fallen garment flew into his hand. He threw it onto Shen Qingqiu’s shoulders. “Put it on!” Outside, it seemed that another lowly patrolling demon passed by the tent and greeted Zhuzhi-Lang. “General!” Zhuzhi-Lang hummed in acknowledgment, then said, “Just in time. Helpme find something.” His tone and stature were completely different compared to how he held himself in front of Tianlang-Jun and Shen Qingqiu. It was truly befitting of an army general. Shen Qingqiu spoke, “Why? I’m going to need to take it off anyway.” Luo Binghe replied angrily, “Why is it that Shizun has to take off your clothes and let him stare are you?” No matter how much he was pressed or scolded, he just wouldn’t stay down. It was a waste of energy for Shen Qingqiu. Just then, Zhuzhi-Lang suddenly returned. It was too late to get back into place, so he immediately turned and sat upright in the center of the bed. Zhuzhi-Lang asked, “Master Shen, didn’t you just say ‘not on the bed’?” Shen Qingqiu smiled a little. “Oh? Really? Did I say that?” Having to cover it up in a rush, he had accidentally sat right on top of Luo Binghe… But sitting like this was actually not badLuo Binghe finally obediently stopped moving. Zhuzhi-Lang walked over and, seeing the mess of blankets, asked casually, “Is Master Shen not hot?” Shen Qingqiu just wanted to get this over with as soon as possible. He grabbed Zhuzhi-Lang’s hand and pressed the bright red coal right up against his chest. In the midst of the hissing sound, he calmly stated, “It’s not hot.” Zhuzhi-Lang replied, “Then, Master Shen, doesn’t it… hurt?” “It doesn’t hurt,” Shen Qingqiu replied. Zhuzhi-Lang’s voice was gratified. “Several times before, Master Shen always seemed extremely reluctant. Tonight you’ve finally taken the initiative, as it should be.” Shen Qingqiu wasn’t really listening to what he was saying at all, his entire mind focused solely on getting this over with as soon as possible so he could chase him out. He asked, “Is this enough?” Zhuzhi-Lang took back the piece of coal and replied, “Yes, this is fine.” Shen Qingqiu was overjoyed. Luo Binghe was probably approaching his limit too. But who knew that Zhuzhi-Lang wasn’t quite done speaking yet. “Junshang has just said that tonight, he too wanted to stop by…” He hadn’t even finished his sentence when Luo Binghe finally couldn’t take it anymore and stood up violently."
"他这么一扯 , 外衣落在脚边。再把那条胳膊送到竹枝郎眼皮底下去 , 后者登时无心再注意其 他地方，对着它认真研究起来。 坚持不懈除拔除了一天的情丝，终于有了衰退的迹象。沈清秋半边胸膛和手臂果真再没像 白天刚醒来时那样须叶茂密了，只剩疏疏零零几根小芽。 洛冰河悄然无声送出一掌，一阵黑气正正朝竹枝郎背后袭来。 沈清秋忽然挥手 , 啪的把竹枝郎手中那颗炭石拍飞。 那块炭石骨碌碌滚到帐外 , 竹枝郎无缘无故挨了一巴掌 , 大惑不解。沈清秋说： “ 手滑。 ” 竹枝郎毫无心理障碍地接受了这个说法，出帐去捡。他在外走了一阵 , 疑道： “ 滚哪儿去 了？ ” 沈清秋脚底一蹬 , 火速上床。洛冰河低声道： “ 师尊，你在他们手底下过的究竟是什么日 子？！ ” 混吃等死无所事事的日子！ 沈清秋也低声道： “ 别乱来 , 被发现了你我都不好过。 ” 说完 , 手起手落，把洛冰河摁回毯子 中。 洛冰河极不甘心 , 憋屈得很。他自觉现在对上天琅君也不会毫无还手之力了 , 可师尊体内血 蛊一日不除，就要一日受制。他勾勾手指，地上外衫飞入手里，他将那外衣披在沈清秋肩 头： “ 穿上！ ” 似乎有路过帐口的小魔在向竹枝郎问好： “ 大将！ ” 竹枝郎 “ 嗯 ” 的应了，道： “ 来得正好。帮我找个东西。 ” 这架子和语气，倒真符合大将的身 份。 沈清秋道： “ 穿什么？本来也是要脱的。 ” 洛冰河震怒： “…… 为什么师尊你非得脱衣服给他看不可？ ” 摁来摁去都摁不老实，沈清秋正费力着，竹枝郎忽然折回来了。 沈清秋来不及站回原位，霍地旋身一压，摆成了端坐于床中央的姿势。 竹枝郎道： “ 沈仙师刚才不是说不上床？ ” 沈清秋呵呵呵： “ 是吗？ ” 藏得匆忙，不小心把洛冰河坐身下了 …… 这一坐也好，洛冰河总算是乖乖不动了。竹枝郎走到床边，见被毯杂乱，随口说了句： “ 沈仙师不热么？ ” 沈清秋只求速战速决，抓着竹枝郎的手，把那块通红的炭石压到胸口，嗤嗤声响中，坦然 道： “ 不热。 ” 竹枝郎： “ 那沈仙师你 …… 不疼？ ” 沈清秋： “ 不疼。 ” 竹枝郎欣慰道： “ 之前数次，沈仙师似乎一直不情不愿，今夜总算主动一次了。 ” 沈清秋压根没听仔细他说了什么，一心想快点弄完快点赶人，口里问： “ 行了吗？ ” 竹枝郎收回炭石，道： “ 可以了。 ” 沈清秋大喜。估计洛冰河也快到极限了。谁知，竹枝郎又加了一句： “ 君上方才说，今晚 也会过来一趟 ……” 句末的 “ 一趟 ” 一没说完，洛冰河终于忍不住，暴起了。 看不清他如何出手的，竹枝郎便单膝跪地，呛了一口血出来。再抬头时，床上便多出了个 人。洛冰河一只胳膊环着沈清秋，正对他怒目而视。 他先是震惊，随后，迅速变成一种恍然大悟： “ 你？沈仙师？你们！ ” 沈清秋把额头埋到手掌里，不想说话。洛冰河另一只手扬起，做了一个 “ 掐 ” 的虚动作，竹 枝郎喉咙间现出几道黑色的手印，身躯猛地吊起，浮在半空中。 沈清秋低声道： “ 你要是在这里杀了天琅君的属下，就麻烦了。 ” 洛冰河紧闭着嘴，手背青筋暴起，五指合拢。 竹枝郎脸色逐渐变青，却硬是没露出痛苦之色。 正当此时，又一个声音在账外响起。 “ 沈峰主，我可以进来吗？ ” 今天晚上为什么这么热闹，说曹操曹操到，这也太快了！ 帐内三人，掐人的被掐的围观的，脸通通刷的黑了。沈清秋先指被掐着脖子吊起的竹枝郎 ，再指洛冰河，比一个抹脖子的动作，再双手交叉比成叉状，一片混乱。洛冰河也不知道 明白没有，就是怒气冲冲地摇头，再摇头！ 这样的情况下，当然不会有人给门外那个回音。片刻的沉默过后，天琅君道： “ 我进来 了。 ” 跟他外甥一样，都是进门之前的询问只是做做样子的类型！ 于是，天琅君进来的时候，看到的就是这样一幅景象。 竹枝郎和沈清秋拉拉扯扯滚在床上，后面一堆被子毯子堆得又高又乱。见他进来，齐齐猛 地转头，四只眼睛两张脸，一般的大惊失色，红白交错。 沈清秋上衣还垮在胳膊肘上，一副要脱不脱的模样。 饶是天琅君为人奇葩，见到这种场面，笑容也一时僵住了。 半晌，他才轻声说： “…… 真是没想到。 ” 竹枝郎汗颜： “ 君上，不是这样的 ……” 他的身躯挡住了洛冰河藏身的被毯，沈清秋则半趴在他身上，将洛冰河那只牢牢掐住他命 门的手遮个正着。 这混乱的体位，加上飘飘的床帘，一时半会儿，真的很难发觉多了个人。 天琅君点头道： “ 不必解释，我懂。我都懂。 ” 以他那爱听春山恨的品味和脑回路，他说 “ 懂 ” ，那就必须需要解释！ 沈清秋说： “ 不知阁下深夜造访所为何事？有事明言无事安寝，谢谢。 ” 天琅君道： “ 其实也不是什么大不了的事情，小小蹊跷而已。竹枝郎又不知哪里去了，所 以我先过来看看。不过，似乎来的不是时候。没关系，你们请继续。我随意。 ” 竹枝郎： “ 君上 ……” 他多说一个字，洛冰河就加力； 稍微动动腿，洛冰河加力； 想换个姿势，洛冰河也要加力； 加力加力，汹涌的魔气顺着命门腾腾灌入，灌得他口里发苦。 竹枝郎不知心塞为何物，但确实体会到了心塞的感觉。 沈清秋： “ 好，多谢体恤，那我们就继续了。你请自便。 ” 天琅君却没有要走的意思，反而找了张凳子，坐了下来。 他悠悠地道： “ 沈峰主为何不追问我，究竟是什么 ‘ 小事情 ’ ？这可跟你之前表现的不大一 样。 ” 看起来，这一位是没那么容易能打发走的了。 沈清秋觉出不对劲，反而镇定下来，笑道： “ 天琅君若喜欢旁观，讲话助兴也无不可。 请。 ” 天琅君道： “ 不久之前，我那边出了一桩小奇事，心魔剑忽然飞起，悬挂空中，嗡鸣不 止。明明并没有人在召使它，却有此现象，实在令人有点在意。 ” 好吧，沈清秋知道了。 刚才洛冰河没说完的 “ 只有一件事需要担心 ” ，就是指心魔剑需要担心。 毕竟是跟随洛冰河多年的佩剑，原主出现在附近，多少会有所感应。 沈清秋说： “ 倒的确是个蹊跷事。不过天琅君来找我谈这个，怕也没什么意义吧。 ” 天琅君缓缓站起，道： “ 找沈峰主谈肯定是没有意义的。可若是有顽皮的小朋友过来找沈 峰主，那就很有意义了。 ” 短短一席话，他分成了好几段，每说半句，便朝床边走近一步。 竹枝郎明被沈清秋双手扒住，暗被洛冰河死死钳着命门，随着天琅君一步一步，越靠越近 ，这对师徒两个人下手都越来越重，他当真是 …… 无辜至极，倒楣至极。 正当天琅君举起手，要掀开床帘时，帐外蓦地传入一阵高亢凄厉的野兽长号。 天琅君猛地撤手，转身望去。 白帐之外，火光冲天而起，飞驰的黑影从四面八方投射而来。兽类长号混杂着声嘶力竭的 呼喊。 “ 有入侵者！ ” “ 围住围住！都围上去！ ” “ 别让他跑了！ ” “ 杀出来了  ！ ” 刀剑相击、剑矢破空、牙爪撕扯之声混作一团。天琅君一句话也来不及说，闪身出帐。 沈清秋一颗心高高抛起又落下。这入侵者来得太是时候了！ 洛冰河翻身下床，扶了他一把。竹枝郎被扔到地上，还暂时无法动弹。 沈清秋道： “ 刚才多谢了。 ” 以他之忠心程度，方才居然没奋不顾身地指出 “ 君上！就是他们！就是这两个人！ ” 也得算 上是他刻意相帮了。 竹枝郎闻言，叹一口气，说： “ 在下能理解的。 ” 沈清秋： “ 理解什么？ ” 洛冰河不耐道： “ 跟他废话什么？ ” 竹枝郎抬起头，诚挚地说： “ 沈仙师为解相思之苦，夜中私会，虽然于清誉有碍，却也情 有可原。 ” 沈清秋： “……” 果然是不应该跟他废话什么！ 走还是留，这是个问题。沈清秋决定先观望一番所谓的入侵者。 他与洛冰河潜出帐外，只见莽原不远处，黑压压的南疆魔族大军团团包围着某一中心。两 道雪白炫目的影子在其中显得犹为夺目。一道是剑影，凛凛然势不可挡，一道是人影，所 过之处寸草不生、片甲不留。 包围圈被不断击溃，又不断有新的魔族填充上去。 天琅君由衷的赞叹顺着夜风飘来： “ 好剑法。好灵力！ ” 来者立在被他斩于赤手之下的一只披甲巨狼头颅上，白衣一尘不染，只有颊边一点飞溅状 的血渍。 这么大张旗鼓、简单粗暴、说打就打、生怕敌营中没人不知道他大驾光临的打法，真不负 百战峰嚣张好战之盛名。 是柳清歌。","CHAPTER 65: THIS FRIEND CIRCLE IS REALLY A MESS Without clearly seeing how he was attacked, Zhuzhi-Lang knelt onto the ground on one knee and coughed out a mouthful of blood. When he lifted his head again, there was another person on the bed. Luo Binghe had one arm wrapped around Shen Qingqiu and was currently glaring at him. First Zhuzhi- Lang was shocked, but then it quickly changed into a flash of realization. “You? Master Shen? You two!” Shen Qingqiu buried his forehead into his palms. He didn’t want to talk. Luo Binghe raised his other hand and made a clenching movement in the air. Several dark fingerprints appeared on Zhuzhi-Lang’s throat as his body was abruptly hoisted up into the air. Shen Qingqiu said, “Don’t kill him. It’ll cause no end of trouble. Moreover, things aren’t what you’re imagining…” Luo Binghe’s mouth was shut tightly, and the veins on the back of his hand bulged as his hand folded closed. Zhuzhi-Lang’s face slowly turned blue, but he still stubbornly didn’t reveal any trace of pain. At that moment, another voice came from outside. “Peak Lord Shen, can I come in?” Why was it so lively tonight? Speak of the devil indeed, so many visitors! The faces of the three people in the tent, with one person being choked while the others watched on, all darkened. Shen Qingqiu first pointed at Zhuzhi- Lang, who was being choked as he dangled in the air, before pointing at Luo Binghe. He made a slicing motion at his throat before crossing his arms into an ‘X’ shape, everything a complete mess. He didn’t know if Luo Binghe understood or not because he shook his head before shaking it again. Under this kind of circumstance, of course, nobody would answer the person outside the door. After a second of silence, Tianlang-Jun said, “I’m coming in.” Just like his nephewboth were the type to ask before coming in anyway just for appearances! As a result, when Tianlang-Jun came inside, what he saw was exactly this scene. Zhuzhi-Lang and Shen Qingqiu tussled and rolled around on the bed, while the pile of blankets behind them was piled both high and messily. When they saw him come in, they both suddenly turned their heads, two pairs of eyesand two faces holding the same expression of fear, their paling skin intermingled with red blushes. Shen Qingqiu’s upper half of his robe was still hooked around his elbows, leaving him half-undressed. Even though Tianlang-Jun was a weirdo, when he saw this scene, his smile also froze for a while. After a long pause, he finally said softly, “I really didn’t expect this.” Zhuzhi-Lang blushed with shame. “My lord, things are a little complicated, but in any case, it’s not what you’re imagining…” His body was blocking the blankets that Luo Binghe was hiding in, and Shen Qingqiu was half on top of him, completely covering Luo Binghe’s hand, which was gripping Zhuzhi-Lang’s vital gate 238 tightly. Such a chaotic position, coupled with the floating curtains around the bed, really made it difficult to tell that there was a third person there, at least for a short while. Tianlang-Jun nodded his head and said, “No need to explain, I understand. I understand everything.” With his love for listening to Resentment of Chunshan and his slow way of thinking about things, when he said he “understood,” that meant that Shen Qingqiu definitely had to explain! Shen Qingqiu said, “For what reason did Your Excellency come to pay a visit so late at night? If something is the matter, please say it clearly, or else I will go rest, thank you.” Tianlang-Jun said, “Actually, it’s not anything serious. A small disturbance happened over on my end, that’s all. I didn’t know where Zhuzhi- Lang disappeared off to either, so I first came over here to take a look. However, I seem to have come at the wrong time. No matter, please continue. I don’t care.” Zhuzhi-Lang, “My lord…” If he said one word too much, Luo Binghe added pressure; If he moved his leg slightly, Luo Binghe added pressure; If he adjusted his position, Luo Binghe added pressure; Adding pressure and adding pressure as the surging demonic energy poured scathingly straight into Zhuzhi-Lang’s vital gate to the point that Shen Qingqiu’s mouth tasted bitter. Zhuzhi-Lang didn’t know what was suffocating him, only that he was indeed experiencing a stifling feeling in his chest. Shen Qingqiu: “Okay, many thanks for your kindness. In that case, we’ll continue. Please do as you wish.”But Tianlang-Jun didn’t seem to have any intention of leaving. Instead, he found a stool and sat down. He said leisurely, “Why does Peak Lord Shen not pursue the matter and ask me what exactly that ‘small disturbance’ is? This is vastly different from your previous curious and passionate attitude.” It seemed like he wouldn’t be sent away so easily. Shen Qingqiu felt as if his troubles were never-ending, but instead, he calmed down and smiled. “If Tianlang-Jun likes to observe, there’s no harm in talking and spicing things up. Please go ahead.” Tianlang-Jun then “spiced things up.” “Not long before this, the Heart Devil sword that was settled at my side suddenly flew up and suspended itself in the air, vibrating ceaselessly. Clearly, nobody was controlling it, but this kind of phenomenon truly is a little hard to miss.” Shen Qingqiu immediately understood. Just then, when Luo Binghe didn’t finish his sentence about how there was “only one thing to be worried about,” he was referring to the Heart Devil sword. After all, it was his sword that had been at his side for many years. If the original owner appeared nearby, it would have some response. Shen Qingqiu said, “That is indeed strange. However, I’m afraid it doesn’t make much sense for Tianlang-Jun to come find me to talk about that.” Tianlang-Jun stood up slowly. “Of course it doesn’t make much sense to talk with Peak Lord Shen about this. But if a naughty child came over to find Peak Lord Shen, then it would make a lot of sense.” He split a short two sentences into quite a few segments. Every half a sentence, he took another step closer to the bed. Zhuzhi-Lang was clearly being restrained by Shen Qingqiu, while Luo Binghe secretly clamped down on his vital gate. As Tianlang-Jun came closer and closer, step by step, this pair of disciple and master clenched tighter and tighter. Zhuzhi-Lang was truly… extremely innocent, and very unlucky. Just when Tianlang-Jun raised his hand and was about to brush aside the curtain, the sound of wild beasts howling shrilly suddenly resounded from outside the tent. He abruptly withdrew his hand and turned to look. Outside of the white tent, flames shot towards the sky. Flitting black shadows threw themselves over from all directions as the long howls of wild beasts mixed with hoarse and exhausted shouts. “There’s an invader!” “Surround him! Surround him! Everyone surround him!”“Don’t let him get away!” “he killed someone!” Blades struck each other as arrows ripped through the sky, blending with the sound of teeth and claws ripping into flesh. Tianlang-Jun didn’t have time to say a single word before he flashed outside of the tent. Shen Qingqiu’s tense and anxious mood settled again. This invader came at such an appropriate time! Luo Binghe flipped off the bed and steadied Shen Qingqiu, while Zhuzhi- Lang was tossed onto the floor and was still temporarily unable to move. Shen Qingqiu lowered his head and said, “Many thanks for just then.” With his degree of loyalty, for Zhuzhi-Lang not to have pointed at them and shouted, “My lord! It’s them! It’s those two!” without any regard for his personal safety, it could be taken as him deliberately helping Shen Qingqiu. When Zhuzhi-Lang heard this, he sighed and said, “This subordinate can understand.” Shen Qingqiu, “Understand what?” Luo Binghe said impatiently, “Why are you wasting time talking to him?” Zhuzhi-Lang lifted his head and said sincerely, “In order for Master Shen to lessen the pain of lovesickness, you two had to meet secretly in the middle of the night. Even though it would inevitably tarnish your reputation, it is still excusable.” Shen Qingqiu: “…” Sure enough, he shouldn’t have wasted time talking to him! The disciple and master slipped out from the tent only to see a dense and dark mass of Nan Jiang demon race troops surrounding something nearby in the wilderness. Two snow-white, glowing figures seemed especially dazzling among the crowd. One was the figure of a sword, chilly and relentless; the other was the figure of a human, and they wiped out and demolished everything they passed. The encirclement was continuously attacked, but it was also continuously refilled by new demon race soldiers. Tianlang-Jun’s heartfelt exclamations of admiration floated over with the night wind. “Great sword technique. Great spiritual energy!” The newcomer stood on an enormous wolf head that was draped in armor, one that he had beheaded with his bare hands. His white clothes were pristine with only a single bloodstain that seemed to have splashed onto his cheek. This kind of showy, simple, rough, attack-when-I-say-to-attack fighting style, as if afraid that nobody in the enemy camp would know that he had graciously arrived, really lived up to Bai Zhan Peak’s aggressive and warlikefamous reputation. It was Liu Qingge. Two snow-white wargs flashed through the crowd of beasts and crouched at Tianlang-Jun’s feet. One of them lifted its head, and a human voice came out from its mouth. “My lord, it’s Bai Zhan Peak’s Peak Lord Liu Qingge from Cang Qiong Mountain!” Tianlang-Jun nodded. “I see. No wonder the sword technique and spiritual energy were so stunning. Only, I’m not sure why Bai Zhan Peak’s Peak Lord would suddenly honor Nan Jiang with his presence?” Liu Qingge moved to the side slightly and the Cheng Luan sword flew back to his hand. He flicked off a drop of blood from the sword tip and said coldly, “Is Shen Qingqiu here?” Shen Qingqiu felt extremely flattered. What, did Renowned Master Liu come to save him? Luo Binghe shot a glance at the expression on his face and pressed his lips together. Tianlang-Jun suddenly saw the light. “So you came to find Peak Lord Shen. He is indeed here with me.” Liu Qingge said, “Tell him to come out.” Tianlang-Jun said with an ambiguous tone, “I’m afraid that it’s not very convenient for him to see you right now. Even if you saw him, he most likely won’t want to go back to Cang Qiong Mountain with you anyway.” Shen Qingqiu actually didn’t know what he should complain about. Liu Qingge narrowed his eyes. One of the wargs at Tianlang-Jun’s feet said, “What Bai Zhan Peak? From what I can see, that’s not necessarily true. I heard that this Liu Qingge fought with that brat Luo Binghe before and lost countless times; he’s long since been undeserving of this name. It should be called ‘Ninety-Nine Battle Peak’ at this rate 239 .” Another warg continued, “No, he should be called Peak Lord of ‘Ninety- Eight Battle Peak.’ If he faces our lord, he will undoubtedly be defeated as well!” These two beasts were so sarcastic. Both flattering and sarcastic! Whenever they disagreed with each other, just fight instead. With a light tap of his foot, Liu Qingge’s figure shot out like white lightning. Tianlang-Jun was in no hurry to meet him in battle. He carelessly flicked his hand, and fresh blood flew out from his fingers. When the blood droplets landed on the ground, they didn’t seep into the dirt. Instead, theycondensed into solid shapes and immediately transformed into six blood wolves with scarlet fur, completely surrounding Liu Qingge, biting and attacking him as they circled around him just like rings of fire. Liu Qingge was more than up for the challenge. Cheng Luan swept out, and all of the six wolves’ heads flew off as they transformed back into liquid. But when the sword spun around, the blood wolves quickly congealed once again and continued to bare their fangs and claw at him. Even though his attacks were precise and powerful to a fault, they didn’t produce any real results. Tianlang-Jun didn’t withdraw his hand either, which was still leaking blood. As he extended it lazily, the blood drops fell, and new wild beasts emerged endlessly. After losing so much blood, Tianlang-Jun’s face didn’t grow paler in the slightest. Was he a portable blood bank? For better or worse, Liu Qingge had come to save him so Shen Qingqiu couldn’t continue watching indifferently. He was about to move when Luo Binghe flashed out, one step ahead of him. Tianlang-Jun stared at him. “As expected, you came.” Luo Binghe said coldly, “Shizun is here, how could I not?” Tianlang-Jun laughed. “Zhuzhi-Lang, look at his face. Looking at his cold scowling expression really makes me happy… hm? Zhuzhi-Lang?” Only then did he discover that Zhuzhi-Lang still hadn’t come out yet, and he revealed a disappointed expression. When enemies met face to face, they would inevitably be extremely furious. Liu Qingge was about to speak from the side when he suddenly spotted Shen Qingqiu. He forgot everything he was about to criticize and was frozen on the spot. He shouted, “Hey!” Shen Qingqiu waved at him. Tianlang-Jun’s astounded expression didn’t recede; on the contrary, it grew even stronger. He said to Luo Binghe, “So… just then… you guys… inside… three people?” Just one sentence, eight words, but Shen Qingqiu still understood clearly what he was trying to imply."
"两头雪白的座狼掠过兽群，伏于天琅君脚下。其中一只仰起头，从嘴里发出人声： “ 君上 , 是苍穹山派，百战峰峰主柳清歌！ ” 天琅君点头： “ 原来如此，难怪剑法灵力都惊绝如斯。只是不知 , 百战峰峰主为何会突然光 临南疆？ ” 柳清歌微微一侧身 , 乘鸾飞回手中。他甩落剑尖的一点血珠，冷冷地道： “ 沈清秋是不是在 这里。 ” 沈清秋受宠若惊。怎么柳巨巨是来解救他的吗！？ 洛冰河瞥了一眼他脸上神色，抿了抿嘴。 天琅君恍然大悟： “ 原来你是来寻沈峰主的。他的确是在我这里。 ” 柳清歌道： “ 让他出来。 ” 天琅君语气暧昧道： “ 现在他恐怕不太方便见你。就算见了 , 多半也不想跟你回苍穹山。 ” 沈清秋呵呵呵呵呵呵。 柳清歌眯了眯眼。天琅君脚边一头座狼道： “ 什么百战峰，我看倒未必见得。听说这柳清 歌与洛冰河那小子交手 , 大败无数次，早就不配这号称了。现在应当叫做 ‘ 九十九战峰 ’ 才 是。 ” 另一头接道： “ 不对，应当叫做 ‘ 九十八战峰 ’ 峰主。他若对上咱们君上，也是必败无疑 的！ ” 这两头畜生真损！又谄媚又损！ 一言不合 , 大打出手。 柳清歌足下一点，白电般身形掠出。天琅君不急着迎战，平伸出一手。暗红色的鲜血从指 间滴落，滴汇成束，变成流落，血液落地不沁入泥土，反而凝结成形。瞬息之间，化出六 只毛色赤红的血狼，团团围住柳清歌，风火轮一般绕着他撕咬偷袭。 柳清歌游刃有余，乘鸾一出，六只尽数头颅飞离，化回液态。可剑锋回转，血狼又迅速重 新凝形，继续龇牙咧嘴张牙舞爪。他的攻击虽然精准强劲，无可挑剔，却并没有起到实际 效果。天琅君也没有收回放血的那只手，就这么伸着，血往下落，不断有新的猛兽化出。 放了这么多血脸色都不带白一下的，他是个移动血库吗！ 沈清秋侧首道： “ 上去帮个忙。 ” 洛冰河不情不愿道： “ 刚才师尊不是还说，万一我被发现了，你我都不好过吗？ ” 刚才是刚才，现在柳清歌被牵涉了进来，自然另当别论。好歹人家是来救他的，冲这个情 面，沈清秋也不能坐视不理。可洛冰河出面也的确不合适，沈清秋想了想： “ 好，你呆 着。我去。 ” 他还没动，洛冰河就抢先一步，闪了出去。 天琅君定睛一看，讶然： “ 你果然来了。 ” 洛冰河冷冷地道： “ 师尊在，我焉能不来？ ” 仇人见面，分外眼红。一旁柳清歌正要说话，忽然瞥见沈清秋，要呵斥的都忘了，当即一 怔，喊道： “ 喂！ ” 沈清秋挥手招呼。天琅君惊诧之色不退反增，对着洛冰河： “ 所以，刚才，你们，在里面 ，三个人？ ” 一句话，断成五个词，沈清秋还是弄明白了他想表达的意思。 洛冰河不知懂了没有，黑着脸迎了上去。 莽原兽群中的战圈，登时成了三方大混战。天琅君打两个，柳清歌也打两个，洛冰河打一 个不理一个，还要扛下两人份的攻击。黑气白光爆炸，剑鸣兽啸冲天。 柳清歌有心接应沈清秋，无奈包围圈越聚越厚，乘鸾旋成一道小型龙卷风，十几只血兽绞 入其中，碎成万千飞溅血珠。沈清秋喝道： “ 闭嘴！别吞进去了！ ” 柳清歌根本不需要闭嘴，因为那些血根本沾不上他的身。天琅君却笑了： “ 我倒还忘了， 还有沈峰主呢。 ” 他倒是希望被忘了 …… 天琅君一记起来，沈清秋立刻不好过了。腹中绞痛之感密密麻麻爬 了上来。 洛冰河原本下手最狠，招招对准天琅君，可现在攻势陡然一缓，心也分了。沈清秋喝道： “ 接着打。别管我！ ” 他不叫不喊，装成毫无感觉的模样，回到帐中，把竹枝郎拖了出来，必要的时候再看看能 不能当人质。他笑得都扭曲了： “ 这回你总不能再往我剑底下撞了吧？ ” 竹枝郎无奈道： “ 在下血脉不纯，出身微贱，若非君上提携，到不了今天的地位。而沈仙 师则救我于水火之中。又何苦总要让我为难。 ” 沈清秋疼得背后直冒冷汗，嘴里有一搭没一搭闲扯，想转移注意力： “ 想必，你对仇恨之 人，也一样毫不留情了。 ” 竹枝郎道： “ 不错。君上也是如此。所以，苍穹山派，昭华寺，幻花宫，天一观，君上一 个也不会留下。 ” 仇恨之人。仇恨之人。 沈清秋忽然想起一件不太好的事情，注意力真的被转移了。 他从幻花宫水牢遁逃后，在花月城，曾听人说，幻花宫水牢守牢弟子被尽数杀死，连公仪 萧也不能幸免。这口黑锅当时盖在了他头上。他又把它扣到了洛冰河脑袋上。说来还没算 清，究竟是谁做的。 竹枝郎现在对他不错，是因为当时自己拦住了要杀他的公仪萧。 那么，公仪萧对他而言，应该就是有仇之人了。 沈清秋缓缓道： “ 你记不记得，公仪萧这个人？ ” 竹枝郎看着他，道： “ 是指那名幻花宫弟子？ ” 果真记得。 “ 那时要去水牢迎接沈仙师，在下先是将那弟子误认作了洛冰河。 ” 沈清秋能理解。公仪萧身形背影，的确和洛冰河有些肖似。甚至乍看之下，容貌也略为相 像。所以他有段时间，对公仪萧格外有亲近之感。 竹枝郎继续说道： “ 后来，发现他就是白露林那名随沈仙师一起进入露芝地的幻花宫大弟 子，便顺手杀了。 ” 顺手杀了。 公仪萧这死的也太冤枉了！ 他只是要动手杀，又没真的杀！ 沈清秋简直不知道该说什么了。 这么看，竹枝郎果真是个很简单的魔，跟他舅舅说的一样， “ 脑子转不过弯 ” 。天琅君提携 他，他就死命跟着；沈清秋无意救过他，他便一直用自己的方式在报答。 同理，睚眦必报。 沈清秋看着竹枝郎的目光越来越复杂，可原先那种轻松惬意的成分已经不在了。 后者刚觉察到这种变化，沈清秋便站起身来，朝前走去。 竹枝郎一愣： “ 你要去哪里？ ” 沈清秋说： “ 我必须走了。再在这里待下去，要病。 ” 天魔血系都是 SJB 。跟一个 SJB 在一起，总比跟两个在一起要强。好歹那一个还肯听他的 话！ 竹枝郎扬声道： “ 我只是想对帮过我的人好。这有什么不对吗？ ” 沈清秋说： “ 可问题在于，你觉得是对我好，我却并不觉得。 ” 他每走一步，都感觉筋脉抽搐，似有万千蠕虫扭动啃噬。洛冰河连连回头看他，好几次都 险些没避过攻击。 竹枝郎不能理解： “ 就算沈仙师不得善终，也执意要和他们一路？ ” 沈清秋不答话，继续往前走。 竹枝郎低声说： “…… 我明白了。 ” 话音刚落，天琅君声音上扬，微含愠意： “ 你在干什么？ ” 沈清秋也莫名其妙，不知道谁干了什么，可忽然之间，体内滞涩疼痛之感尽数消失了。 在场中人，只有天魔血系者才知道怎么回事。 原先沈清秋体内有三道天魔血，洛冰河以一对二，略处下风。而刚才，竹枝郎不再催动血 蛊与洛冰河作对，而是倒戈一击，和洛冰河联手压下了天琅君的血。 姨妈不疼了，那还留在这儿打什么！ 沈清秋拔出修雅，飞身上剑，喝道： “ 柳师弟，走！ ” 柳清歌见他御剑飞来，也翻身踏上乘鸾。天琅君总算不放血玩儿了，魔气裹挟一掌袭来， 被洛冰河挡了回去。沈清秋路过，顺手一拉，洛冰河扬手，一串动作接合得天衣无缝，两 手正正握住，随之一提，便把洛冰河带上了修雅剑。 两道剑光瞬息之间驰出天外。 莽原上嚎声连片。天琅君打个响指，余下的几十头血兽失去动力，皮毛獠牙迅速融化，不 多时便化成滩滩极不新鲜的黑红血液，溶入土壤之中。 他看向竹枝郎： “ 就这么放走了？ ” 竹枝郎一言不答，对他单膝跪下。 天琅君不甚在意，让他起来，随口道： “ 也罢。各人有各人路。强求不得。他总有一天会 领会你的好意。 ” 竹枝郎心知，那就是四大派灭门之时。费尽心思，恩人却毫不领情，一心奔着死路去，也 实在无奈至极。 天琅君又看了看远处天边，喃喃道： “ 不过，实在没想到。沈峰主居然喜欢人多。每次都 必须至少三人吗？ ” 竹枝郎： “……” 君上大概最近又看了什么人界流传的奇怪配图小册子了。 三人御剑飞出数里，直奔边境之地。 柳清歌没想到沈清秋把洛冰河也捎带了，怒道： “ 你拉他干什么？！ ” 柳清歌和洛冰河之间苦大仇深的，沈清秋一时半会儿说不清楚，笼统道： “ 这是有原因的 ……” 洛冰河听他没否决 “ 在一起 ” 三个字，眉眼弯弯，嘴角也勾了起来。柳清歌见他无端端笑意 盎然，手中拟了个诀，灵力指间兹兹流闪，警惕道： “ 沈清秋，你过来！ ” 洛冰河变脸比翻书还快，前一刻还温情脉脉，下一秒就嘲色满堆，搂紧了沈清秋的腰。他 原本就楼的紧，再这么一使力，沈清秋险些喘不过气，一巴掌拍松他的手，才说： “ 柳师 弟，这个解释起来略复杂，咱们现在先走，回头我再慢慢说。你要先相信我。 ” 柳清歌说： “ 我信你。但我不信他。 ” 沈清秋不假思索道： “ 我信他。 ” 柳清歌眉峰一凛，肃然道： “ 之前你信他，什么下场？ ” 洛冰河的微笑绵里藏针，口气不冷不热： “ 师尊都说信我了，你还废话什么？ ” 是嫌没打够吗？！ 沈清秋说： “ 对师叔怎么说话的？ ” 柳清歌本来就话少，何来的废话？他果真不多说了，甩出一团暴击。 这可是高空行驶，在剑上面打架很好玩么？！注意安全，安全第一！ 沈清秋偏了一下飞行轨道，算着应该闪过了，洛冰河却在身后闷哼了一声。 沈清秋转头问： “ 怎么了？ ” 真打中了？ 洛冰河摇摇头，道： “ 没事。不疼。 ” 照理说，就算被打中了，也应该没什么啊？沈清秋仔细看了看他，觉得他印堂间的确有一 股黑气，沉吟道： “ 你脸色不太好。 ” 洛冰河嗓子虚软，温言道： “ 跟那老魔头对上的时候，头就有点晕。刚才更晕了。不过也 没什么，一记暴击而已。 ” 不知怎么回事，柳清歌忽然有种和人血战到底的冲动。这都打过多少次了，一个暴击就头 晕了？ 他说： “ 沈清秋你让开。 ” 沈清秋忙赔笑道： “ 柳师弟，他之前有伤在身，才刚好，你千万别跟他一般见识。他不懂 事，要是冒犯了你，我代他道歉。 ” 柳清歌看上去就要当空一口凌霄血了。沈清秋见他脸色不善，又说： “ 他之前是犯了不少 错，今后不会了。我一定好好管教 ……” 柳清歌的脸终于青了： “…… 你真信他？ ” 沈清秋心虚了。洛冰河还抱着他的腰，又露出了那种略惴惴不安的神色，似在等着他的回 答。 说实话，之前他其实从来没真正地信任过洛冰河，所以一直误伤。事到如今 …… 沈清秋苦笑道： “ 还是宁可信其有，不可信其无吧。 ”","CHAPTER 66: CIRCLE OF NOBLES, WANTON DISORDER He didn’t know if Luo Binghe understood, but he forged ahead, his face darkening. This wilderness battlefield amidst the crowd of beasts immediately became a three-way brawl. Tianlang-Jun was fighting two, Liu Qingge was also fighting two, Luo Binghe was fighting one and ignoring one, while still bearing two people’s worth of attacks. Black energy and white light exploded across the scene, sword shrieks and beast hisses rushing into the sky. Liu Qingge came to rescue Shen Qingqiu, but the ring encircling him grew thicker and thicker. Cheng Luan whirled like a miniature tornado, and the dozen blood beasts mixed in the crowd splattered into thousands of droplets of blood. Shen Qingqiu yelled, “Close your mouth! Don’t swallow them!” Liu Qingge didn’t need to close his mouth at all ━ those droplets couldn’t even moisten his sleeves. Tianlang-Jun, however, smiled. “I seem to have forgotten that Peak Lord Shen is still here.” He wished he had been forgotten… once Tianlang-Jun remembered he was here, life would get much more difficult for him. A griping pain crawled up thickly in his stomach. At first, Luo Binghe was the fiercest of the three fighters, each strike directed precisely at Tianlang-Jun, but now his offense suddenly slowed, his heart divided. Shen Qingqiu yelled, “Keep fighting. Don’t mind me!” He didn’t shout or cry out, pretending he couldn’t feel anything at all. Returning to the tent, he dragged out Zhuzhi-Lang, his smile twisted into a sneer. “You won’t be able to throw yourself under my sword this time, right?” Zhuzhi-Lang said helplessly, “I owe a heavy debt of kindness to both Peak Lord Shen and my lord. Why must you always make things difficult for me?” A cold sweat broke out on Shen Qingqiu’s pained back. He idly threw back a response to distract himself. “You really keep a clear record of your gratitudes and grudges.” The demon race’s officials were truly each as dedicated to their profession as Sha Hualing, preaching their grand mission at every possible opportunity. Zhuzhi-Lang, under the point of his sword, continued to admonish him. “That’s right. So, because the four great sects overpowered my lord with base tricks many years ago, one day, they will pay. Cang Qiong Mountain, Zhao HuaTemple, Huan Hua Palace, Tian Yi Overlook ━ my lord said not one will be left behind, so it’s certain that not one will be left behind.” Hearing him bring up Huan Hua Palace, Shen Qingqiu’s heartstrings tightened. After he had escaped from Huan Hua Palace’s water prison into Hua Yue City, he had heard that the disciples guarding the water prison had all been killed. Even Gongyi Xiao was not lucky enough to escape. This black pot had been thrown on his head at the time, and he had pressed it on Luo Binghe’s head in turn. But, while rushing about until today, he never had the chance to determine who had actually killed them. Zhuzhi-Lang was good to him now because he had stopped Gongyi Xiao from killing him that time, becoming a benefactor in his eyes. Then, accordingly, Gongyi Xiao should be an enemy. Shen Qingqiu said, “Do you remember Gongyi Xiao?” Zhuzhi-Lang thought for a while and said, “That disciple from Hua Hua Palace?” Sure enough, he remembered. “That time when I went to the water prison to meet Master Shen, at first I mistook him for Luo Binghe.” Shen Qingqiu could understand. From the back, Gongyi Xiao really did resemble Luo Binghe. If someone only took a quick look, their features also had some subtle similarities. So for a time, he felt especially attached to Gongyi Xiao. Zhuzhi-Lang continued, “Afterwards, I found out he was precisely that Huan Hua Palace senior disciple who entered the dew cave in Bai Lu Forest with Master Shen. So, I killed him in passing.” Killed him in passing. Zhuzhi-Lang really was a very simple demon. As his uncle said, he was “a little foolish.” Tianlang-Jun had supported him so he would follow him until death. Shen Qingqiu had inadvertently saved him, so he was paying him back in his own way all along. For the same reason, every small grievance must be avenged 240 . It’s just that Gongyi Xiao’s death was rather too unjust. He had only moved to kill, but he didn’t actually kill him! Shen Qingqiu heard Gongyi Xiao’s parting words, “If we meet again, Elder Shen must fulfill his promise to take me to visit Qing Jing Peak. I’ll always be waiting…” as if he was speaking right beside Shen Qingqiu’s ear.Shen Qingqiu simply didn’t know what to say. He watched Zhuzhi-Lang’s gaze grow more and more complicated, but his former effortless ease was already long gone. Just as the latter noticed this change, Shen Qingqiu stood up, walking forwards. Zhuzhi-Lang started. “Where are you going?” Shen Qingqiu said, “Anywhere is fine, as long as it’s far away.” These Heavenly Demons were all mental cases. Going with one mental case would at least be better than going with two. At worst, that one would still listen to him! Zhuzhi-Lang looked like he had been stung. In a flash, he said, “I only wanted to be good to the people who helped me. Is there anything wrong with that?” Shen Qingqiu said, “The problem is, you think the things you do are good for me, but I don’t feel the same.” With every step, he felt his veins twist, like thousands of worms were squirming and chewing his insides. Luo Binghe repeatedly turned his head to look at him, many times narrowly avoiding an attack. Zhuzhi-Lang couldn’t understand. “Even if Master Shen couldn’t achieve a peaceful end, why are you determined on staying with him all the way?” Shen Qingqiu didn’t answer, continuing to walk forward. Zhuzhi-Lang said in a low voice, “I understand.” Before his words had fallen, the stagnant pain in Shen Qingqiu’s body completely disappeared. Tianlang-Jun’s voice entered the scene, with a tone of slight indignation. “What are you doing?” Of the people on the scene, only those of the Heavenly Demon lineage knew what was happening. At first, there were three sets of blood parasites in Shen Qingqiu’s body. Luo Binghe fought one on two, so he was at a slight disadvantage. But, just now, Zhuzhi-Lang stopped urging his blood parasites against Luo Binghe but turned sides to join with Luo Binghe in suppressing Tianlang-Jun’s blood. Without the pain, what was there to fear? Shen Qingqiu drew Xiu Ya, vaulting onto the sword. “Liu Shidi, let’s go!” Seeing him fly over on his sword, Liu Qingge also flipped onto Cheng Luan. Tianlang-Jun finally stopped playing with his blood, a palm full of demonic energy sweeping over to attack, but was blocked by Luo Binghe. Shen Qingqiu passed by, reaching down as Luo Binghe raised his arm. Their movements strung together like seamless heavenly clothes, two hands joiningright on target. With a pull, he took Luo Binghe along on Xiu Ya. The two sword glares disappeared into the sky in a flash. The sky above the wilderness filled with howls. Tianlang-Jun snapped his fingers, and the remaining dozen blood beasts lost their vigor, fur and fangs rapidly melting. Before long, they transformed into a spatter of blood droplets, quickly dissolving into the ground. He looked at Zhuzhi-Lang. “You’re letting them go just like that?” Zhuzhi-Lang didn’t say a word in reply, going down on one knee. Tianlang-Jun had excellent self-restraint. His anger would only persist for a moment, and he had long gone over to say, “Ah you, think it through carefully. He doesn’t appreciate your kindness at all, he’s just wholeheartedly rushing down the road to disaster. Zhuzhi-Lang, you’re already this old. How do you not know your head’s turned around a bend?” He gestured for Zhuzhi-Lang to get up and said off-handedly, “But you don’t need to be so sad. Peak Lord Shen will understand you’re acting for his own good one day. It’s not far off.” Zhuzhi-Lang knew in his heart that that would be the day the four great sects were extinguished. Tianlang-Jun sent another glance to the sky, muttering, “But, I truly never would have thought. Peak Lord Shen likes there to be more people. Does there have to be at least three people every time?” “…” The changing fields of Zhuzhi-Lang’s mind grew barren in a flash, as if a sudden gale had blown through 241 . His lord had probably been reading those strange illustrated pamphlets spread from the human realm again. The three had flown several kilometers on their swords, heading straight for the borderlands. Liu Qingge didn’t think Shen Qingqiu would bring Luo Binghe with them. “What are you dragging him along for? Why are you together with him?” Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe held a deeply ingrained resentment towards each other, and Shen Qingqiu couldn’t explain on the spot. He said vaguely, “This, I have a reason for…” Hearing that he didn’t refute the word “together,” Luo Binghe’s eyes curved, the corner of his mouth also curling up. Liu Qingge, seeing him break out into a full smile for no reason, formed a seal in his hand, spiritual energy sizzling between his fingers. He warned, “Shen Qingqiu, you come over here.”Luo Binghe changed faces faster than flipping the pages of a book. He was warm and tender one moment but full of mockery the next, holding onto Shen Qingqiu’s waist tighter. He was already holding on tight, and with this extra force Shen Qingqiu nearly couldn’t breathe. Slapping his hand away, he said, “Liu Shidi, this explanation is a bit complicated. Let’s escape first, then I can tell you slowly later. Just trust me for now.” Liu Qingge said, “I trust you. But I don’t trust him.” Shen Qingqiu said without thinking, “I trust him.” Liu Qingge’s expression hardened. He said solemnly, “You trusted him before, and what was the result?” Luo Binghe’s smile was like a needle concealed in silk floss. His tone was neither hostile nor friendly as he said, “Shizun already said he trusts me. Why are you still wasting your words?” Are you not done fighting yet? Shen Qingqiu said, “How are you speaking to your Shishu?” Liu Qingge was already so short-spoken, so where were these wasted words? Indeed, he didn’t have any more to say and threw out a ball of explosive power. We’re traveling at high altitudes ━ is it that fun to fight while riding swords? Be careful, safety is number one! Shen Qingqiu tilted his course for a bit. He should have dodged the attack, but he heard a smothered groan from Luo Binghe behind him. Shen Qingqiu turned his head to ask, “What is it?” Was he really hit? Luo Binghe shook his head and said, “It’s nothing. It doesn’t hurt.” Usually, even if he was hit, he’s fine, right? Shen Qingqiu looked him over carefully and saw a wisp of dark energy between his eyebrows. He muttered, “Your face doesn’t look very good.” Luo Binghe’s voice softened, saying warmly, “When I was fighting that old demon, my head was a bit dizzy. Just now, it was dizzier. But it’s nothing, just an explosive attack, that’s all.” Each of Liu Qingge’s bloody battles with him was more violent than the last. How many times had they fought? Now he’s dizzy from one explosive attack? He said, “Shen Qingqiu, you get out of the way.” Shen Qingqiu hurriedly gave an apologetic smile. “Liu Shidi, he was injured before and just recovered. By all means, don’t lower yourself to his level.He isn’t sensible; if he offended you, I’ll apologize in his place.” Liu Qingge’s expression didn’t improve, but Shen Qingqiu continued. “He has made many mistakes before, but he won’t from now on. I’ll definitely discipline him well…” Liu Qingge’s face finally cleared. “You really trust him?” Shen Qingqiu wasn’t as confident as he sounded. Luo Binghe was still holding his waist, with that look of anxious anticipation on his face again, like he was waiting for his reply. To speak the truth, he had never truly trusted Luo Binghe before, and he was unintentionally hurting him all along. Things having reached this stage… Shen Qingqiu forced a smile. “It’s better to believe than not 242 .” In a home, if the kids weren’t sensible, the adults don’t have it easy. Shen Qingqiu finished his apology and gave some kind words. “It’s been some time since we’ve seen each other, and Liu Shidi’s cultivation has advanced even more.” Liu Qingge raised his chin. “I just exited seclusion.” When Luo Binghe surrounded Cang Qiong Mountain, Liu Qingge said to “Wait!” Turns out he really did enter seclusion to cultivate. He had come to save him right after exiting seclusion; Shen Qingqiu felt that a simple word of thanks wouldn’t be enough. He rubbed his nose and said off-handedly, “How did you know to look for me in the Southern border?” After Liu Qingge first exited seclusion, he had rushed to Luo Binghe’s territory in the Northern border at top speed, storming his way in and almost upturning the whole area. But, in the end, Shen Qingqiu wasn’t there. Luo Binghe wasn’t there either and had reportedly retreated like he was running back for a confession. He first captured that demon woman Sha whatever to interrogate her. However, Bai Zhan Peak’s preferred interrogation method was beating up the suspect. At best, it was beating up the suspect to different levels of severity. Liu-juju 243 certainly couldn’t beat up a woman, and since Sha Hualing was especially hard to deal with, he didn’t get anything out of her. Luckily, he had run into that eating-his-fill-all-day, wandering-idly-with- nothing-to-do Shang Qinghua. Liu Qingge couldn’t tolerate these goods in the least. But, just as he had raised his fist, Shang Qinghua started confessing everything in an unceasing torrent of chatter, including how Shen Qingqiu’s meals were in the demon realm, his daily activities to amuse himself and pass the time, as well as the important news about how he had been taken away to the Southern border.After getting the information out of him, Liu Qingge planned to execute this traitor on the spot, but Shang Qinghua started to hug his thighs and wail to wake the dead, promising over and over that he didn’t want to do it and he would turn over a new leaf 244 . His howls had drawn out Mobei-Jun. The two fought, toppling much of Luo Binghe’s underground palace, which had delayed him for some time. These rhythmical ups and downs, this thing full of scenes of violence, was precisely the story of Liu-juju’s journey these last few days. Troubling his heart and strength like this… Liu Qingge is truly a man more reliable than a blood brother 245 ! After reservedly expressing his tears of gratitude, he changed the topic and said firmly, “Liu Shidi, I have official business I need to tell you.” Liu Qingge said, “Go on.” Shen Qingqiu said, “Do you know of Tianlang-Jun?” Of the famous figures in the cultivation world, this name could be described as legendary. Many years ago, in the battle where Tianlang-Jun had been suppressed under Bai Lu Mountain, the four great sects had turned out in full strength 246 . Though Cang Qiong Mountain was the main force, those that had fought in the war were all the former generation of Peak Lords. Of the current Peak Lords of Cang Qiong Mountain, only Yue Qingyuan had gone to war as Qiong Ding Peak’s head disciple. Furthermore, he had shown his brilliance using Xuan Su and took on a crucial role. Liu Qingge naturally wouldn’t be unaware of these things. “The demon race’s last demon saint? His corporeal body has been destroyed for some years.” Shen Qingqiu said, “The destruction of a corporeal body doesn’t necessarily mean death. He might have shed his shell.” Liu Qingge raised one eyebrow. “Like you?” Shen Qingqiu sighed in shame. “Exactly.” Liu Qingge didn’t chase that line of conversation. “He escaped, then what?” Shen Qingqiu said, “Tianlang-Jun has plans of merging the demon realm and the human realm.” “Does that mean he plans to attack the human realm?” Shen Qingqiu knew it would be very easy for a normal person to confuse these two concepts. This “merging” he spoke of, many people would take it as just “unification.” In fact, it was not so. What Tianlang-Jun planned to do withthe Heart Devil sword was indeed a “merging” in the literal sense."
"家里孩子不懂事，大人不容易做。沈清秋赔完笑 , 又说好话： “ 一段日子不见，柳师弟修为 愈发精进了。 ” 柳清歌扬了扬下巴： “ 闭关刚出。 ” 洛冰河围堵苍穹山那时，柳清歌说过 “ 等着！ ”, 果然是闭关修炼去了。刚出关就来救人， 沈清秋摸了摸鼻子 , 心觉单说谢谢似乎不够。 洛冰河眼珠在两人之间左转右转，插嘴道： “ 还是不如我强。 ” 沈清秋看了他一眼。是是是 , 你最强，男主全书第一挂 , 能不强吗？知道啦！ 他又面向柳清歌 , 调开话题： “ 你怎么知道来南疆这里找我？ ” 原来柳清歌出关之后，火速赶至魔界北疆洛冰河的地盘 , 一路杀进去 , 几乎杀翻个底朝天 , 结 果沈清秋不在 , 洛冰河也不在 , 说是匆匆赶回交待一番就立刻撤了。他先是抓住那名叫纱什 么的魔族妖女审问  百战峰的审问方法就是殴打，充其量只分不同程度的殴打。他当然 不好殴打女子，于是没问出来。好在，又撞上了闲得乱晃的尚清华。 对这货柳清歌可毫不容情，拳头刚扬起来，他就滔滔不绝地全招了，包括沈清秋呆在魔界 时的伙食如何、每日的消遣娱乐活动、以及被掳到到南疆去的重要信息。 问出来之后，柳清歌便打算把这叛徒就地正法，岂料那漠北君又突然冒出来。两人打了一 架，把洛冰河的地宫震塌了小半，这才耽误了些时间。 这跌宕起伏、充斥着暴力元素的一段东西，就是柳巨巨近期的行程了。 如此费心费力 …… 柳清歌，真是一个比亲哥还靠谱的男人啊！ 沈清秋这才想起有要紧的事必须交代，正色道： “ 好了，就此打住，柳师弟，我有正事必 须告诉你。 ” 柳清歌道： “ 讲。 ” 沈清秋说： “ 你可知天琅君？ ” 对于修真界的人士而言，这个名字可谓是传说级的。 数年前，天琅君被镇压于白露山之下的那一战，四大派倾巢而出。苍穹山派虽然也是主力 ，但那时参战的都是上一代的峰主们。现任苍穹山派的峰主中，只有岳清源作为穹顶峰首 席弟子参战过，并且以玄肃崭露头角，起到了关键作用。 这些柳清歌自然不会不知道： “ 魔族上一任圣君？他肉身损毁已有七八年了。 ” 沈清秋说： “ 肉身损毁，不代表死了。也有可能是脱壳了。 ” 柳清歌扬起一边眉毛： “ 和你一样？ ” 沈清秋心中惭愧，干咳： “ 正是。 ” 柳清歌不追究下去了： “ 他出来了，然后？ ” 沈清秋说： “ 天琅君打算合并魔界与人界。 ” “ 是指他打算攻上人界？ ” 沈清秋就知道，一般人很容易搞混这两个概念。 说到 “ 合并 ” ，许多人都以为只是 “ 统一 ” 的意思，其实不然，天琅君打算用心魔剑做的，是 字面意思上的 “ 合并 ” 。 魔界和人界，就如同一张纸的两面，处于不同的空间。在纸张的正面画上一笔，再怎么延 伸，也画不到反面去。 而心魔剑，则能够把这张纸的正反，拼接到同一个平面。 举个例子。人界大陆上有洛川这条河流，魔界则有埋骨岭，这两个地方处于异界空间。而 原著中，洛冰河以心魔为匙，将两界合并后，埋骨岭便被 “ 拼 ” 在了洛川中央，变成了一座 孤岛。 简单地解释过后，柳清歌皱起眉： “ 这种事真做得到？ ” 当然做得到。原著洛冰河就成功办到了！ 沈清秋沉沉点头。柳清歌想了想，道： “ 兹事体大。还需证据，方能取信于诸位掌门。 ” 要说证据，还真没有。沈清秋正略感头疼，这时，安静了半晌的洛冰河忽然道： “ 师尊为 何不问我？ ” 沈清秋还没答话，柳清歌先行一步，嗤了一声。 嗤的原因很充分。洛冰河有魔族血统，并且早早跟诸派翻脸，恶名远扬，幻花宫被他生生 搞成了邪教组织，虽然实力在他的操控下不弱反强，四大派早就把它踢出行伍，作为修真 大派却名存实亡，自然也帮不上忙。 所以，问他，恐怕没什么建树吧 …… 这话沈清秋心里明白，却不能多说。不然洛冰河那颗脆弱的玻璃心不知道还要怎么碎呢。 他干笑了几声，还没笑完，肩膀上忽然多了一点重量。 洛冰河的头轻轻靠在了他的左肩上。 沈清秋以为他又在撒娇，抖了一下，可再仔细看看，洛冰河的眼睛闭着，是一副安然昏睡 的模样。 站着也能睡！刚才不还聊得好好的吗！ 沈清秋反手捉紧他胳膊，防止他摔下飞剑，轻声唤道： “ 洛冰河？ ” 没有反应。顿了一顿，沈清秋换了更低更轻的声音： “…… 冰河？ ” 叫了两声，他才慢慢睁开眼睛，沈清秋见他眼神涣散，忍不住问： “ 你是不是真的很累？ ” 离出圣陵还没几天，洛冰河受过的那一大堆伤就算好得快，怕是也有些遗留后果，晕一晕 也是有可能的。 洛冰河摇摇头： “ 没有。 ” 沈清秋琢磨了下，转向抱着双手冷冷注视这边的柳清歌： “ 柳师弟，过了边境之地，不如 你先走，回苍穹山派和掌门师兄他们召各派商议一下。 ” 柳清歌双目微睁： “ 那你呢。 ” 沈清秋说： “ 我可能要迟些回去。洛 …… 冰河他这个样子，我看，还是休息一下再走稳 妥。 ” 柳清歌提气道： “ 我来，就是为把你带回去。 ” 沈清秋踌躇，洛冰河一言不发，低着头，模样看着乖巧得很，他又说： “ 就一晚。 ” 柳清歌看着窝在沈清秋身后的洛冰河，严厉地说： “ 一晚也不行。 ” 那怎么办呢？ 一个时辰之后，三人穿过边境之地，停在城中最大的客栈门前。 这座城远离中原，多的是杂门小派，却鲜少见到这般丰神俊朗、仙气凌然的人物出现，还 一次出来三个，一个赛一个的好看，不少都驻足围观。柳清歌昂首阔步，握着乘鸾，率先 迈进门槛。 大堂富丽，宽敞明亮，立刻有伙计上前招呼。沈清秋道： “ 柳师弟，你真要跟我们一起？ ” 总感觉柳清歌是那种不食人间烟火，根本不需要睡觉、就算睡觉也会在云气缭绕的灵台上 的类型。 柳清歌执剑抱手站着，冷冰冰地说： “ 不放心。 ” 他眼皮一抬，恰好见到洛冰河在沈清秋身后，无声地哼哧了两下。眼珠邪转，嘴角笑容轻 蔑，目光恶意满得都要溢出来了，登时大怒，握着乘鸾的手背青筋暴起。沈清秋见状忙道 ：“ 有话好说，不要生气。 ” 他再回头，洛冰河一脸无辜地眨了眨眼睛，嘴唇还微微有些发 白。 伙计笑道： “ 几位客官是来住宿的？ ” 柳清歌不理人，洛冰河一副随时要倒的模样，沈清秋只好自己出来： “ 不错。 ” 伙计： “ 要几间房？ ” 沈清秋： “ 三 ……” 洛冰河： “ 两间。 ” 柳清歌就差没把 “ 狼子野心，可恨可诛 ” 八个字写在脸上了。 洛冰河和颜悦色道： “ 麻烦两间房。谢谢。 ” 柳清歌说： “ 三间。 ” 洛冰河笑了笑，反问道： “ 请问，谁出钱？ ” 沈清秋柳清歌滞了一下。 沈清秋不消说，刚从魔窟跑出来，哪有带这些东西。柳清歌就更不可能了，杀了一路的人 ，怎么可能记得在身上放钱。 洛冰河慢条斯理地说： “ 是我。我没带够钱。所以，两间。 ” 沈清秋： “…… 柳师弟，你别跟他计较了。 ” 这个问题是真心没办法解决。没钱的话，总不能把修雅或者乘鸾当了吧 …… 也不知道洛冰河是不是故意的。现在沈清秋是真不敢随便下定论了，领了房牌，上楼时柳 清歌走在最前，沈清秋在中间，回头无奈地说： “ 下次再这样气你师叔，就把你卖了凑 钱。 ” 洛冰河仰脸道： “ 师尊你总是这么狠心。 ” 前方的柳清歌回头看了一眼，皱了皱鼻子，一副打心底嫌弃的模样。 能让他露出这幅表情，洛冰河也算是很厉害了。 两个房间紧紧挨着。 房间的分配是个严肃的问题。 柳清歌自有考量。这洛冰河为人行事都匪夷所思，邪气甚重，连抱着具尸体都能一抱五 年。现在，这活人就在他眼前。 能让他得逞？ 空气中似有火花噼里啪啦碰撞。沈清秋从容不迫，开门，转身，关门。 关了，又蓦地拉开一条缝： “ 那你们好好休息吧。 ” 火花瞬间结冰了。 柳清歌： “…… 喂！ ” 逗他呢？！ 洛冰河印堂这下真黑成一团乌云了，控诉道： “ 师尊，他会杀了我的。 ” 沈清秋对柳清歌竖起食指： “ 你可以打。别打死就成。 ” 开玩笑。他可不敢跟洛冰河一个房。直弯深夜共处一室，找死呢！ 是的沈清秋坚持他还是直的！会看狂傲仙魔途这种种马文就是杠杠的证明！ 也不敢和柳清歌一个房。虽然柳巨巨乃苍穹山派第一直男，直得天地可鉴，但洛冰河这魔 界小醋王一缸子翻了，更不好对付。 综上所述，沈清秋愉悦地说： “ 就这么决定了。 ” 洛冰河泫然欲泣： “…… 师尊你怎么忍心。 ” 沈清秋呵呵，果断关门。留下走廊外石化风中的两人，外焦里嫩。 本来是看洛冰河体虚气弱，才决定找个地方休息的，这么看，他不是气色挺好的吗？ 白操心了！ 沐浴完毕后，沈清秋换上干净的中衣，闲来无事，见窗边小几上叠着几本薄薄的小册子。 本本封面花里胡哨，看不清标题大字，还标着 “ 壹 ” 、 “ 贰 ” 、 “ 叁 ” 等等数字，便抽了一本， 靠在床头看。 一目十行翻了翻，这小册子所载文字，辞藻艳丽，叙事缠绵，还配有十分精美的插图。沈 清秋正想再仔细看看，久违的系统提示嘤咛的来了。 系统：【您好。通知一：爽度超出一定数值，关键道具掉落条件达成，请做好接收准备； 如掉落时未能接住，则道具作废。】 关键道具。那个能消除怒气值 5000 点的假玉观音？ 沈清秋把手里的小册子抛到一边： “ 你等下。 ‘ 爽度超出一定数值，关键道具掉落条件达 成’ ，是说之前没达到一定爽度的时候，关键道具是不能够启用的？ ” 系统：【正确理解。】 那之前还提示他是否启用关键道具有毛线用啊？ 点了启用，没达成条件，不是照样要用情景小推手？！ 而且，这个道具其实也没什么用了吧。沈清秋真心觉得，现在的他，就算不跟洛冰河搅基 ，只要不跟别的人搅基，男主的怒气值就不会上涨。 就算把洛冰河摁在地上往死里打，他会增加的也只是爽度而已 …… 系统：【通知二：前方高能。前方昭华寺即将出现重点任务。请贵方做好接受任务准备。 祝您愉快。】 2.0 还有前方高能提示！ 说起来，最近洛冰河有些动作亲近过了头，爽度却一直没有增加。这点沈清秋一直抱有疑 惑。 不是沈清秋自恋，而是按照洛冰河那个瞪一眼骂一句打一下都能蹭蹭蹭暴涨的尿性，没有 翻倍，真的不科学。 莫非是他没听到，错过了提示？ 戳开数据库，爽度果真没有增加多少。 他问了出来。系统答道：【由于近期爽度一项数值的增加过于频繁，为节省系统资源，爽 度改为月结算。祝您愉快。】 月结算？ 沈清秋有预感，那将会是一个很可怕的数字 …… 他正要回忆一下，原著昭华寺这一块有什么重要剧情，忽然，房间的木门被 “ 叩 ” 的轻敲了 一下。","CHAPTER 67: A THREE-MAN JOURNEY The demon world and the human world were like two sides of a sheet of paper, existing in two different dimensions. If someone were to draw a line on one side of the paper, no matter how long they extended that line, it would never reach the other side. However, the Heart Devil sword was able to meld these two different sides of paper into one surface. For example, the human continent had the Luochuan River, while the demon world had the Maigu Mountains. These two locations existed in completely different spaces. However, the original Luo Binghe had used the Heart Devil sword to connect these two worlds together. Afterward, the Maigu Mountains had been “pierced” into the middle of the Luochuan River, forming an island. He explained a simplified version of the story to Liu Qingge. Liu Qingge furrowed his brows. “These things can really be done?” Of course, it could be done. After all, the original Luo Binghe had succeeded! Shen Qingqiu solemnly nodded. Liu Qingge thought for a while before finally saying, “This is no small matter. You still need evidence before you can convince everyone else.” If he wanted proof, then there really wasn’t any. Shen Qingqiu felt his head begin to ache. At this time, the previously silent Luo Binghe asked: “Shizun, why didn’t you ask me?” Shen Qingqiu didn’t have a chance to respond when Liu Qingge suddenly stepped forwards, giving a cold snort. The reasoning behind the snort was obvious. Luo Binghe was of demon blood, and had fallen out with the other sects long ago; his evil reputation spread far and wide. Under his hands, Huan Hua Palace had been transformed into an evil organization. Although the Palace was strong and flourishing under his leadership, the four great sects had long refused to acknowledge him as an ally. It had turned into a “the name remained, but the prestige had long disappeared” kind of situation. Therefore, it was natural that he would be unable to help. Asking him would probably make no difference… Shen Qingqiu was naturally aware of this, but he didn’t linger on the subject. Otherwise, Luo Binghe’s fragile glass heart would probably shatter. Heforced a laugh, but before he could finish, he was aware of a new weight on his shoulder. Luo Binghe’s head lightly rested against his left shoulder. Shen Qingqiu thought that this was another tantrum, and shook his shoulder. However, after careful observation, he realized that Luo Binghe’s eyes were tightly closed, the perfect image of peaceful sleep. He could even sleep while standing. Wasn’t he awake and talking a moment ago? Shen Qingqiu reached out a hand to grasp his arm, preventing him from falling off the flying sword. Quietly, he asked: “Luo Binghe?” There was no reaction. Pausing, Shen Qingqiu changed his voice into a lower and more gentle sound: “Binghe?” It was only after his name was called two times did Luo Binghe slowly open his eyes. Shen Qingqiu stared at his dazed eyes, unable to stop himself from asking, “Are you tired?” It had only been a few days since they left the Holy Mausoleum. During that time, Luo Binghe had suffered a great number of wounds. Although he had recovered quickly, it was possible that there were side-effects. Dizziness was perhaps one of them. Luo Binghe shook his head. “No.” Shen Qingqiu thought for a moment before turning around to face Liu Qingge, who was holding his hands together and coldly watching the scene. “Liu-shidi, when we pass the border, how about you first go ahead and return to Cang Qiong Sect? Go with our shixiongs and call together all of the other sects for a discussion.” Liu Qingge’s two eyes widened slightly. “What about you.” Shen Qingqiu said, “I may return a little later. Luo… Binghe, in his current state, may need a few days to recuperate to return safely.” Liu Qingge inhaled. “I came to bring you back.” Shen Qingqiu hesitated, while Luo Binghe remained silent. He lowered his head, looking extremely lovable and obedient. Shen Qingqiu spoke again. “Just one night.” Liu Qingge stared at Luo Binghe, who had nested himself behind Shen Qingqiu. Strictly, he said, “One night is also not allowed.” Then what are we supposed to do? Two hours later, the three of them passed the border and stopped in front of the doors of the largest tavern in the city.This tavern was far from the central plains, with many people originating from a miscellaneous mix of small sects. It was rare for them to see one graceful, god-like cultivator, much less three at once who were each as handsome as the next. Liu Qingge, grasping onto Cheng Luan, took the initiative to strut confidently through the doorstep. The lobby was extremely beautiful, its spacious walls gleaming with light. As they entered, there was a man who immediately arrived to greet them. Shen Qingqiu asked, “Liu-shidi, are you sure you want to accompany us?” He had always thought of Liu Qingge as someone who placed himself above all others, who didn’t need sleep to function. Even if he were to sleep, it would be curled up within the clouds while cultivating. Liu Qingge grasped onto his sword, coldly saying: “I wouldn’t feel at ease otherwise 247 .” He looked up just in time to meet eyes with Luo Binghe, who was standing behind Shen Qingqiu. Silently Luo Binghe snorted twice, his eyes looking away and his lips twisting into a smile of contempt. Liu Qingge immediately became enraged, his grip tightening on Cheng Luan until his veins turned blue. Seeing this, Shen Qingqiu hurriedly said, “If there’s anything you have to say, say it. Don’t be angry.” He turned around. Luo Binghe innocently blinked at him, his lips still starkly pale. The tavern assistant smiled. “How many customers are looking for accommodation here?” Liu Qingge ignored him and Luo Binghe looked like he would collapse at any moment. Shen Qingqiu could only step out by himself. “Yes.” The assistant: “How many rooms are you looking for?” Shen Qingqiu: “Three…” Luo Binghe: “Two rooms.” Liu Qingge’s expression was that of seeing a vicious criminal, hateful and deserving to be put to death. Luo Binghe amicably said, “I’ll trouble you to prepare two rooms, thank you.” Liu Qingge said, “Three rooms.” Luo Binghe smiled, replying, “Excuse me, but who is paying?” Shen Qingqiu and Liu Qingge both froze.Shen Qingqiu’s position was obvious; he had just escaped from the heart of the demon world, so why would he carry such unnecessary items with him? Liu Qingge was even more out of the question. Someone as removed from the mortal world as him, who had only fought and killed the entire journey, would not be the kind to remember to bring money. Luo Binghe leisurely said, “It’s me. I didn’t bring enough money. Therefore, two rooms.” Shen Qingqiu: “Liu-shidi, don’t argue with him.” This kind of problem really didn’t have any other solutions. If they didn’t have enough money, it wasn’t like they could sell off Xiu Ya or Cheng Luan… One did not know if Luo Binghe was doing this on purpose. Right now, Shen Qingqiu didn’t dare to find out the truth. With the room tablets in hand, they ascended the stairs, with Liu Qingge at the forefront and Shen Qingqiu in the middle. Shen Qingqiu turned around, helplessly saying, “The next time you anger your shishu like this, I’ll sell you off to recompense the debt.” Luo Binghe raised his head. “Shizun, you always treat me so heartlessly.” In front of them, Liu Qingge glanced back to look at them. He wrinkled his nose, feeling the growing urge to hack them both to death. One to bury on the mountain summit and one to scatter at the bottom of the ocean. The two rooms were adjacent to each other. The room distribution was the solemn question at hand. Liu Qingge was having a serious dilemma. This Luo Binghe’s conduct was unimaginably freakish and his evil influence was extremely strong to the point of hugging a corpse for five years straight. Right now, the man himself was in front of his eyes. Could he let him have his way? It was as if sparks were colliding in the air. Shen Qingqiu calmly opened the door, turned around, and shut the door. After the door was closed, he suddenly opened it again a fraction. His tone was dignified. “Then, you two have a good rest.” The sparks suddenly froze over. Liu Qingge: “Hey!” A black cloud seemed to form over Luo Binghe. “Shizun, he’s going to kill me.” Shen Qingqiu pointed at Liu Qingge. “You can fight. Just don’t beat him to death.” What a joke. He didn’t dare to share a room with Luo Binghe. A straightand a gay man sharing a room at night ━ wouldn’t that be the same as seeking death? That’s right, Shen Qingqiu still considered himself to be straight! To read a stallion novel like Proud Immortal Demon Way was the very proof of his sexuality! He also didn’t dare to share a room with Liu Qingge. It was true that Liu Qingge was, since the beginning of time, the world’s first straight man, as straight as the reflection of the sun and moon or the day and night. However, if Luo Binghe, this demon Vinegar King 248 were to flip over his jar, the situation would be even harder to handle. Shen Qingqiu cheerfully said, “It’s been decided like this then.” Luo Binghe wept and sobbed as he accused Shen Qingqiu: “Shizun, you really have a heart of steel.” Shen Qingqiu laughed, but firmly closed the door. The two people outside were left petrified. The outside was burnt, but the inside was tender. They had only stopped over here to rest because of Luo Binghe’s poor health. But now, looking at it, didn’t his complexion look perfectly healthy? So he had worried all for nothing! After he took a bath, Shen Qingqiu changed into clean clothing. At leisure with nothing to do, he found a few thin booklets stacked by the window. While the cover was extremely gaudy ━ he was unable to make out the large characters in its title ━ he recognized the “One,” “Two,” “Three,” and so on. Grabbing a booklet, Shen Qingqiu leaned against the headboard to read. From a cursory glance at a few lines, he found that this booklet was filled with numerous words. The rhetoric was beautifully written, the narrative touching, all of which were accompanied by extremely beautiful illustrations. Shen Qingqiu wanted to read the book more carefully when suddenly, the semi- forgotten sound of the system popped up. System: Hello. Notice 1: Coolness level exceeds the set value, the key item drop prerequisite has been met. Please prepare to receive the item; if the host cannot collect the item when it drops, then the item will become invalid. A key item. Was it that fake Guanyin jade that was capable of nullifying 5000 points of anger? Shen Qingqiu threw the booklet in his hands to the side. “Wait a minute. ‘Coolness level exceeds the set value, the key item drop prerequisite has been met’does that mean that before my Coolness level met the required value, that key item wasn’t able to be used?”System:That is correct. But before, when he was having a crisis, didn’t the System ask him if he wanted to use the item or not? To be able to use it before meeting the prerequisites, wasn’t this the same as using a scenario advancer? Furthermore, this crucial item wasn’t that useful to him. Shen Qingqiu believed that right now, even if he didn’t “get involved” with Luo Binghe, the male lead’s anger would not rise as long as he didn’t “get involved” with anyone else. Even if he pressed Luo Binghe to the ground and beat him half to death, the only thing that would go up would be his Coolness level. System:Notice 2: Action scene ahead. An important assignment is about to occur at Zhao Hua Temple. Please prepare to receive the assignment. Wishing you a pleasant day. 2.0 even had the ability to warn about action scenes ahead! To tell the truth, recently some of Luo Binghe’s actions had been overly intimate, but the Coolness level hadn’t increased. Shen Qingqiu held some doubt towards this. He wasn’t being narcissistic, but hitting, scolding, or even looking at Luo Binghe that masochist had always caused his Coolness level to go up. Now, hearing no reaction, it was really too unscientific. Could it be that he hadn’t heard the notification, missing the System announcements altogether? But opening the database, he found that his Coolness level really hadn’t increased that much. He asked the question to the System. The System replied: Because the host’s Coolness level has increased too much recently, in order to save the System’s resources, all Coolness point increases will be calculated at the end of each month 249 . Wishing you a pleasant day. Calculated at the end of each month? Shen Qingqiu had a premonition that it would be an extremely frightening number… He was just about to try to remember what the original plot of Zhao Hua Temple was when, suddenly, several loud knocks sounded on the wooden door of his room. Shen Qingqiu’s initial thoughts were that it was definitely Luo Binghe. But when he went to open the door, only then did he realize that he had thought too highly of himself 250 . The person who walked inside was Liu Qingge. But wasn’t Liu Qingge the type to kick down a door and barge into a room? Since when did he learn to knock?A straight man could be let inside! Shen Qingqiu moved aside to let him in before closing the door. Without thinking, he asked, “Liu-shidi, why are you here so late? Where’s Luo Binghe?” Liu Qingge’s face was wooden. “I don’t know!” His expression was clearly written on his face: he would rather sleep on the roof than share a room with that bastard. Inwardly, Shen Qingqiu laughed a little desperately. Liu Qingge glanced at him before reaching inside his robes and pulling out an object, which he threw towards Shen Qingqiu. Catching it, Shen Qingqiu realized that it was one of the folding fans he had left behind in Qing Jing Peak. Shen Qingqiu was unable to restrain his emotions. Unfolding it, he allowed the cool air to blow against his face, creating the cool and noble image of a deity. The folding fan really was the most powerful bullshitting weapon. He could already feel his bullshit level increasing! He felt a bit emotional. “Shidi… you remembered to bring this for me.” Liu Qingge obviously did not come just to give him the folding fan. Pulling out a chair, he sat down upright and still with only an arm resting against the table. Solemnly, he said, “I need to talk to you.” Shen Qingqiu was affected by this mood. He corrected his posture, straightening his back stiffly. Just as solemnly, he replied, “Alright, speak.” Liu Qingge said, “You and Luo Binghe, what happened between you two?” The Peak Leader of Bai Zhan Peak would definitely not ask this question out of a need for gossip. Shen Qingqiu pondered for a moment, before sincerely saying, “I… also do not understand what happened. The situation had already turned into this before I could react.” Liu Qingge said, “Do you really believe that he turned over a new leaf?” Shen Qingqiu said, “It isn’t that he’s turned over a new leaf. It’s that I’ve always misunderstood him.” Liu Qingge laughed coldly. “Misunderstood? He forced you to self detonate, tormented Huan Hua Palace, besieged Cang Qiong Mountain, smashed the roof of the Palace Hall, injured our Shixiong, the Sect Masterare these all misunderstandings?” Hearing the last phrase, Shen Qingqiu asked, “Is the Sect Master 251 alright? He suffered injuries last time. Did Mu-shidi heal them? Was it really Luo Binghe who injured him?” Liu Qingge indignantly said, “Who else could it be? You’re still lookingfor excuses for him? You really are stupid.” No. He wasn’t looking for an excuse for Luo Binghe. He was just unable to believe that it really was Luo Binghe who had injured Yue Qingyuan. One must keep in mind that in the original Proud Immortal Demon Way , Luo Binghe had clashed with Yue QingYuan quite a few times, but never once did he ever gain the upper hand against the Sect Leader. It was only through exploiting the original Shen QingQiu that he could kill the Sect Leader so brutally with ten thousand arrows through the heart. Speaking of which, no matter if it was the original world or this world, Yue Qingyuan’s treatment of Shen Qingqiu was really too generous. Back when Shen Qingqiu was reading Proud Immortal Demon Way , he had been upset how such an upright and morally righteous sect leader had treated a trash villain in such a kind manner. Could it be that these two had some kind of hidden relationship? Would it fill in one of the novel’s plot holes?"
"沈清秋第一反应 , 觉得肯定是洛冰河。 可来人进门后，他才发现这次脸大了一回。 走进来的居然是柳清歌。 柳清歌不是一向都喜欢踩着被他踹倒的门板直接进房吗，他什么时候学会敲门的？！ 直男 , 可以放进来！沈清秋侧身相让，关了门，他随口问： “ 柳师弟深夜造访所为何事？洛 冰河呢？ ” 柳清歌板着脸： “ 不知道！ ” 那表情明明白白写着，他宁可睡屋顶也不跟那小畜生一个房间。 沈清秋心里笑得直打跌 , 柳清歌瞪他一眼 , 把手伸入怀中 , 掏出了一样东西 , 抛过来。沈清秋抬 手接住，一看，居然是他搁在清静峰竹舍的一把旧折扇。 沈清秋情不自禁唰的展开，凉风习习 , 顿觉神清气爽。 果然折扇才是装 b 利器，瞬间感觉 b 格暴涨！ 他感动了： “ 师弟 …… 你竟然还记得带这个给我！ ” 柳清歌当然不是专程来给他送折扇的 , 他拣了个凳子，正襟危坐，只有一条手臂搁在桌上 ，肃然道： “ 我有话跟你说。 ” 被他情绪感染，沈清秋也不由得正经起来，挺直了腰杆。 柳清歌道： “ 你跟洛冰河，究竟是怎么回事？ ” 百战峰峰主肯定不是抱着八卦的心态来问这句话的。沈清秋琢磨了一阵，由衷地说： “ 我 也不知道是怎么回事，反应过来的时候，就变成这样了。 ” 柳清歌道： “ 你真心相信他改过自新了？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 不是改过自新，而是我似乎一直对他有所误会。 ” 柳清歌冷笑： “ 误会？他逼你自爆，荼毒幻花宫，围堵苍穹山，烧砸穹顶殿，打伤掌门师 兄，都是误会？ ” 一听最后一句，沈清秋立刻追问道： “ 掌门师兄没事吧？上次他似乎带了伤，木师弟给他 看好了么？真是洛冰河下的手？ ” 柳清歌愠道： “ 不然还能是谁？你还想给他找借口？真是糊涂！ ” 不。他不是想给洛冰河找借口，而是真不能确信，洛冰河能那么简单打伤岳清源。 要知道，中，洛冰河和岳清源也有过几次正面交手，可一次也没能讨到这位掌门的便宜。 还是利用了原装货沈清秋，才将这一派之首害至万箭穿心的惨死地步。 说起来，无论原著还是这个世界，岳清源对 “ 沈清秋 ” ，确实厚待得非比寻常。看书的时候 他老早就郁闷了，这么好一个掌门，凭什么要对一个猥琐人渣掏心掏肺？这其中是否有什 么未曾发掘的渊源？会不会也属于填坑项目之一？ 他在低头沉思，柳清歌却以为他被骂得心生羞愧，神色缓了缓，口气也不那么严厉了： “ 诸位同门都不明白，你究竟为何对他那么好。 ” …… 说真的，沈清秋没觉得自己对洛冰河有多好。真的！ 柳清歌微微前倾身子，明烛照映得他雪白的脸染上一层暖色。 他紧绷绷地问： “ 还是说，那些传闻，尽皆属实？ ” 以为柳巨巨会对八卦嗤之以鼻的他真是太天真太甜了！ 沈清秋抓紧了折扇，呵呵呵呵： “ 柳师弟居然也会听信传闻这些无稽之谈。 ” 柳清歌重新坐直了身子： “ 我不信。你却一心袒护那白眼狼。 ” 沈清秋无奈道： “ 我没袒护他。只是不想再误解他。 ” 柳清歌冷淡地道： “ 我不懂你们之间的事。江山易改，本性难移。洛冰河绝非善类，你好 自为之。 ” 他说完，起身就走。 沈清秋当然也知道洛冰河绝非善类，可如今也不能断定他属于歹类，兀自头疼。那边，柳 清歌即将出门，路过那方小几，瞥了一眼，像是瞥到什么了不得的东西，一脚踩了个空。 沈清秋抬头，见柳清歌还没出门，觉察有异： “ 怎么？ ” 柳清歌僵硬地回头，用一种全新的复杂目光上下打量他。 半晌，摇了摇头，这才开门出去。短短几步路，似乎还被门槛绊了一下。 究竟怎么了？！ 沈清秋蒙头一夜大睡。 第二日清晨，半梦半醒之间，他觉察到，房间里进了人。 这人轻手轻脚，四下走动。沈清秋掀开眼皮一看，当即愣住了。 会有兴趣大清早溜到他房间里的，当然只有洛冰河。 不过，是很不一样的洛冰河。 他换上了一身白衣，黑发也用浅色的发带规规矩矩束起，正神色轻松惬意地在房间里忙前 忙后。 这幅装束和模样，和仙盟大会之前的洛冰河全无二致。一个标准的纯洁无暇名门弟子（划 掉）勤快能干小俏媳妇（划掉）的形象，实在 …… 实在是太具有欺骗性了！ 洛冰河转头，见他一只胳膊撑起了上身，笑眯眯地道： “ 师尊醒了？早膳在桌上。 ” 沈清秋一手扶额，身体却不由自主做出了反应，握住洛冰河一只手，下了床。 怪就怪在，这样的早晨根本是过往清静峰每日清晨的服务标配。下床，披衣，洗漱，上桌 ，吃，自然而然地就在洛冰河的贴心服务下把一套做完了。 如果场景换作清静峰竹舍，真的会有一种时光倒流的可怕错觉！ 洛冰河评价道： “ 这客栈的早饭真难吃。委屈师尊了。 ” 如果对比对象是洛冰河的手艺的话，这评价非常之客官。 沈清秋深吸了口气，问： “ 你师叔呢？ ” 洛冰河面带微笑： “ 不知道。 ” 这两个人一提到对方，都是简单粗暴的 “ 不知道 ” 三个字。沈清秋算出摸出门道来了，问了 也是白问。 一晃神的功夫，洛冰河又去给他铺床了。 混世魔王给他铺床！这画面太美，沈清秋不敢看！ 冷不防，洛冰河的声音传来： “ 不过，师尊既然让我管柳清歌叫师叔，就是说，还是承认 我是清静峰弟子了。 ” 这不废话吗？ 你都追着师尊前师尊后喊了多少声了？ 沈清秋道： “ 为师什么时候说过你不是我弟子？ ” 洛冰河低声说： “ 我还以为师尊早就默认把我逐出师门了。我一直追着叫师尊，其实很怕 只是我一厢情愿。 ” …… 受不了。 沈清秋捂脸。 有点儿志气行吗？冰哥！！！ 你可是对后宫们冷酷地说过 “ 我的女人就是这么多而且只会越来越多要么忍要么滚 ” 这种霸 气侧漏宣言的绝品种马男。 这个一边给人家端茶送水洗衣叠被一边羞答答扭着背才肯讲话的纯情少男究竟是谁？ 啊？ 是谁占据了你的身体！ 沈清秋终于又有了训徒弟的机会。他喝了一口茶： “ 你有这个想法，很好。既然你知道自 己还是清静峰的弟子，那么今后对诸位师叔师伯就不能像现在这么无礼。尤其是今天回苍 穹山之后，老老实实为你上次围山砸殿的事道歉。 ” 道歉当然不仅仅是口头上的道歉。一定要把破坏的公共设施原价赔偿。这是起码的诚意！ 洛冰河一边顺手收走了早膳的盘子，一边漫不经心说： “ 今天不必回苍穹山了。 ” 沈清秋： “ 你说什么？ ” 洛冰河道： “ 我说，师尊若真想见诸位 …… 师叔师伯，不必回苍穹山。我们调转方向，直 接前往昭华寺即可。 ” “ 昭华寺 ” 三个字从他嘴里吐出时，系统发来提示：【 “ 昭华寺 ” 任务正式发布！发布人：洛 冰河。请贵方选择是否接受！】 任务发起人居然是洛冰河本人么！ 沈清秋眯了眯眼： “ 你怎么知道的？ ” 洛冰河道： “ 师尊去了不就知道？趁着柳 …… 柳师叔还没回来。 ” 话音刚落，哐当一声，柳清歌便踹门回来了。 他看也没看洛冰河一眼，对沈清秋道： “ 改道。今日不回苍穹山，去昭华寺。 ” 沈清秋站起身来： “ 出了事？ ” 柳清歌沉声道： “ 出了事。昨晚子夜过后的消息。今日不少门派都有派首应邀前去昭华寺 商议。苍穹山派包括在内。本城的修真世家方才已整装出发。 ” 前往昭华寺途中，路径金兰城。 时隔几年，也不知昔日繁华的商业之都经历那一场劫难之后，如今是什么模样，要不是紧 着赶路，沈清秋肯定要飞那厚厚的云层去瞧上一瞧。 过金兰城不久之后，便是昭华寺。 宝寺庄严，坐落于一座苍翠古山腰侧。原本是一座清幽古刹，今日却人声鼎沸，人影蹿动 ，山腰更不断有飞剑阵成群结队驶入驶出。 大雄宝殿层层石阶之下，三人驻足。柳清歌对沈清秋道： “ 你随我去见掌门师兄。 ” 沈清秋刚要点头，洛冰河也跟了上来。他身份特殊，这场合出现比较敏感，沈清秋说： “ 你先匿一匿，不要让诸位派首把矛头指向你。 ” 洛冰河无所谓道： “ 要指便指。我当然要跟着师尊走。 ” 这又是个不听劝的。真让他跟着，被人认了出来，会多出许多不必要的麻烦。沈清秋道： “ 柳师弟你先去，我随后就来。 ” 柳清歌冷冷横他们一眼，飞身上阶，先去和苍穹山派会合了。 只要刻意收敛，洛冰河完全可以让自己看上去人畜无害，混在熙熙攘攘的人群中，除了脸 格外好看些，真的像个普通门派的好徒弟。至于沈清秋，除了在金兰城有一次不太光彩的 抛头露面，这都埋土里多少年没露脸过了，被认出来的几率更小 …… 殿外和广场上围了一圈又一圈的人墙。若是在以往，最多最趾高气扬的，肯定是幻花宫的 弟子，可如今幻花宫已成邪教，自然被排斥在外，压根未曾受邀，一个也不见。 大雄宝殿中心主持大局的是昭华寺数位方丈。无尘大师竟也站在其中，沈清秋定睛细看， 才发现他两条小腿皆是木制假肢，借此才能如常站立行走。 苍穹山派以岳清源为首，坐在殿侧，柳清歌刚站到他身后，俯身低语几句，岳清源神色触 动，微微扬头，四下环视。无尘大师旁，便是昭华寺的主持无妄方丈。 这位须眉花白的老和尚双手合十，浑厚低沉的声音在大殿中回荡，听来响亮至极。 “ 老衲便直问了。 ” “ 在场诸位，究竟有多少人前夜做了那同一个梦？ ”","CHAPTER 68: IN ZHAO HUA TEMPLE PART 1 He had lowered his head in contemplation, but Liu Qingge thought he was ashamed after the scolding. His expression relaxed and his tone became less severe. “All our comrades don’t understand why you insist on being so good to him.” Liu Qingge leaned slightly forwards and the bright candlelight painted a layer of warmth onto his snow-pale face. He asked tightly, “Or to say, those rumors, are they all true?” He really had been too naive and innocent to believe that Liu-juju would turn up his nose to that gossip. Shen Qingqiu’s grip tightened on his fan. “So even Liu-shidi would believe those nonsense rumors.” Liu Qingge sat straight again. “I don’t believe them. But you have been wholeheartedly shielding that thankless wretch.” Shen Qingqiu said helplessly, “I haven’t been shielding him. I just don’t want to misunderstand him again.” Liu Qingge said coldly, “I don’t understand the things between you two. It’s easier to shift the mountains and rivers than to change one’s essential character 252 . Luo Binghe is absolutely not the benevolent type, you take good care.” He finished, rose, and walked out. Naturally, Shen Qingqiu also knew Luo Binghe was absolutely not the benevolent type. But, up until now he still could not determine whether or not he was the wicked type ━ still such a headache. Liu Qingge was almost out the door when he gave the small table a glimpse as he passed by and seemed to have seen something unbelievable, his foot stepping on air. Raising his head, Shen Qingqiu saw that Liu Qingge still had not left the room. He sensed that something was off. “What?” Liu Qingge stiffly turned his head, looking him up and down with the complex gaze of someone regarding something they had never seen before. After a while, he shook his head and finally opened the door to leave. In those short few steps, he seemed to have tripped over the door sill. What is it? Shen Qingqiu slept soundly that night. Early in the morning the next day, when he was still half in a dream, he sensed someone else in the room. This person was quiet and light-footed, moving about every corner of theroom. Shen Qingqiu lifted an eyelid to look and froze, staring on spot. The only one who’d be interested in slipping into his room first thing in the morning, of course, it would be Luo Binghe. But, this was a very different Luo Binghe. He had changed into a set of white clothes, black hair also bound up in an orderly fashion with a light-colored ribbon. He hurried about the room with a relaxed and contented expression. This attire and this look were entirely identical to the Luo Binghe from before the Immortal Alliance Conference. A model of a pure and busy disciple from a major sect (cross that out), the image of a diligent and competent young charming maiden (cross that out), it’s really… it really is… Luo Binghe turned his head. Seeing him propping himself up on one arm, he reached out a hand and said, all smiles, “Shizun is awake? The morning meal is on the table.” Shen Qingqiu propped up his forehead on one hand, but his body responded on its own and took Luo Binghe’s hand, getting off the bed. The strange thing was, this sort of morning ritual was the exact same type of service he received every morning long ago on Qing Jing Peak. Getting up, getting dressed, washing up, sitting down, eating breakfast ━ the whole set was done automatically under Luo Binghe’s careful service. If the setting was swapped for the bamboo house on Qing Jing Peak, there really would be a frightful illusion of time flowing backward! Luo Binghe said, “This guest house’s breakfast really is unpalatable. I’ve wronged Shizun.” If the object of comparison was Luo Binghe’s handiwork, this evaluation was very polite. Shen Qingqiu sighed deeply and asked, “Where is your shishu?” Luo Binghe said with a smile, “I don’t know.” Whenever one mentioned one of those two to the other, it would always be those simple and rough three words. Shen Qingqiu figured he had gone as far down that path of inquiry as he could; asking him would be wasting his words. In a lively flash, Luo Binghe had gone to make his bed. This devil incarnate was making his bed! This scene was too satisfying, but Shen Qingqiu didn’t dare to look. Suddenly, Luo Binghe’s voice rose again. “But, since Shizun is willing to let me call Liu Qingge Shishu, this is to say, you still acknowledge me as a disciple of Qing Jing Peak.” No kidding? How many times have you chased me yelling Shizun this, Shizun that?Shen Qingqiu said, “When has this teacher said you’re not my disciple?” Luo Binghe said in a low voice, “I always thought Shizun had long tacitly driven me from his door. I always chased you yelling Shizun, but in fact, I was very much afraid it was just my one-sided wishful thinking.” … He couldn’t take it. Shen Qingqiu facepalmed. Have some backbone, won’t you? Bing-ge! You’re the one who stood up in front of the harem and said, “I have this many women and there’s only going to be more and more ━ take it or get lost.” This type of tyrannical and callous declaration was from a peerless stallion protagonist. This pure-hearted young man, bringing tea, fetching water, washing clothes, and making beds while bashfully only speaking when his back is turned ━ who is he? Ah? Who’s possessing your body? Shen Qingqiu finally had another opportunity to instruct his disciple. He drank a mouthful of tea and said, “It’s very good that you think this way. Since you know you are still a disciple of Qing Jing Peak, then from now on you cannot be this rude to your shishu and shibo 253 . Especially when we return to Cang Qiong Mountain today, you must obediently apologize for the last time you encircled the mountain and smashed their halls.” Of course, the apology would not only be a verbal apology. You have to compensate for the original cost of construction of every building you broke. This was the minimum amount of good faith you could afford. While efficiently storing away the breakfast dishes, Luo Binghe said carelessly, “We don’t need to return to Cang Qiong Mountain today.” Shen Qingqiu: “En. En? What are you talking about?” Luo Binghe said, “I’m saying, if Shizun really wants to see all… my shishu and shibo, we need not return to Cang Qiong Mountain. We can just make a turn and proceed directly towards Zhao Hua Temple. As soon as those three words “Zhao Hua Temple” left his mouth, the System sent a notification: The “Zhao Hua Temple” mission has been officially assigned! Assigner: Luo Binghe. Please select whether or not to accept! Accept GladlyAccept reluctantlyRefuse Luo Binghe himself initiated this mission. Shen Qingqiu squinted. “How did you know?”Luo Binghe said, “Won’t Shizun know if he goes? Let’s go while Liu… Liu-shishu hasn’t returned.” Before his words had fallen, Liu Qingge returned, kicking the door open with a bang. Though the door had been kicked over, Shen Qingqiu felt that this was the style and entrance method the normal Liu Qingge should have, so his expression did not change. Liu Qingge didn’t spare Luo Binghe a glance as he said to Shen Qingqiu, “Change of plans. We’re not returning to Cang Qiong Mountain today; we’re going to Zhao Hua Temple.” Shen Qingqiu stood up. “Did something happen?” Liu Qingge said severely, “Something happened. The news came midnight last night. Today, many sects are going to discuss at Zhao Hua Temple on the head cultivator’s invitation. Cang Qiong Mountain Sect is included. This city’s cultivator clan just got ready to set off.” On the way to Zhao Hua Temple, they passed through Jinlan City. In those few years, this formerly flourishing merchant capital had undergone some unknown calamity to be the way it was today. If they weren’t hurrying on an urgent journey, Shen Qingqiu would definitely fly that thick layer of cloud to go take a look. Not long after they passed Jinlan City, they reached Zhao Hua Temple. The treasured temple was dignified and stately, nestled at the waist of an ancient verdant mountain. It was usually a quiet and secluded temple, but now it was a boiling cauldron of voices, silhouettes darting back and forth, an unceasing parade of troops on flying swords sailing in and out of the mountain’s waist. The three stopped at the foot of the layers upon layers of stone steps to the Hall of Great Strength. Liu Qingge said to Shen Qingqiu, “Come with me to go see Zhangmen Shixiong.” Shen Qingqiu was just about to nod when Luo Binghe followed behind. His status was unusual and his appearance in this context would cause a sensitive situation. Shen Qingqiu said, “You go hide first; don’t let all the sect heads point their spears at you.” Luo Binghe said indifferently, “If they want to point then let them point. Of course, I have to go with Shizun.” This one really wouldn’t listen to advice. If he actually followed and someone recognized him, it would add a lot of unnecessary annoyances. Shen Qingqiu said, “Liu-shidi, you go ahead. I’ll come soon after.” Liu Qingge shot them a cold glance and flew up the steps, going torendezvous with Cang Qiong Mountain. As long as he meticulously curbed his energy and adjusted his expression, Luo Binghe could make himself look like a harmless stock character and slip into the bustling crowd. He really did look like a fine youth from a normal sect ━ it’s just that his face was a bit excessively good-looking and it was hard to avoid drawing people’s attention. As for Shen Qingqiu, aside from that one not- quite-splendid time he showed his face in Jinlan City, he had been buried in the dirt, not showing his face for many years. The chance of being recognized was even lower. Spectators, packed into layers, encircled the temple hall and plaza in a wall of humanity. In the past, the most numerous and the most high and mighty definitely would have been Huan Hua Palace’s disciples. But, now that Huan Hua Palace had become a demonic cult, they were naturally excluded. They had not even received an invitation, and not one of them was in sight. Several Zhao Hua Temple abbots presided over the conference in the center of the Hall of Great Strength. Even Great Master Wu Chen was standing among them 254 . Only after looking closer was Shen Qingqiu able to discover that both his lower legs were wooden prosthetics. With these, he would be able to stand and walk as normal. Cang Qiong Mountain, with Yue Qingyuan as head, sat at the side of the hall, holding a solemn and respectful gaze. Liu Qingge had just arrived behind, stooping over to mutter a few words. Yue Qingyuan’s expression stirred. Slightly inclining his head, he cast his gaze around to all sides. Beside Great Master Wu Chen was Zhao Hua Temple’s host, abbot Wu Wang 255 . This grizzled old monk held his palms together, his deep and low voice resounding through the great hall loud and clear. “This old monk will ask directly.” “Everyone present, how many of you had that same dream last night?” Dream? Needless to say, this was Luo Binghe’s doing! The latter said softly by Shen Qingqiu’s ear, “Shizun, weren’t you stressing about not having ‘evidence’? This way, won’t you not have to go to the trouble?” No wonder he had slept for a while on Xiu Ya. Shen Qingqiu had thought he had run out of strength but turns out he had been activating his dream abilities at that time. Luo Binghe’s gaze was brimming with “Praise me!” and “Pat my head!”,but his head began to hurt. What sort of dreamland had Luo Binghe constructed for them to make the state of affairs so serious that this many people would hastily converge at Zhao Hua Temple for a serious discussion… He didn’t need to ask before someone else said irritably, “Has anyone said a word about what type of dream this was?” This person looked very familiar. After pondering for a while, Shen Qingqiu suddenly realized. Wasn’t this that… from Hua Yue City, what sect was it ━ oh, the Ba Qi Sect, the head disciple 256 from Ba Qi Sect! Great Master Wu Chen said politely, “If I may ask this sect master, what is your cultivation level?” The person replied, “Late-stage core formation!” The two abbots sent each other a glance, and many people began to cough lightly. Mysteriously, Great Master Wu Chen seemed to have come to a small realization. “That… this is quite strange. In this temple, everyone above the core formation stage all had the same dream…” The meaning behind his words was that if he really was in late-stage core formation, he should also have had the dream… The people below voiced their agreements one after another. “That’s right, all of us below core formation were perfectly fine last night.” To have lied about one’s cultivation status under everyone’s eyes, and to have been exposed on the spot, this really was lifting up a stone and dropping it on your own foot 257 . Shen Qingqiu inwardly lit a candle for this dear friend who spent so long without a bit of progress. Though that shixiong’s cultivation hadn’t grown too much in these years, his face had gotten quite a bit thicker. He still didn’t act ashamed and said in a loud voice, “There are exceptions for everything! What’s more important to discuss ━ what type of dream was it?” Ba Qi Sect, with this name leaking hegemonic spirit, didn’t even have a single cultivator who had achieved core formation 258 . Or else, he wouldn’t have needed to chase this line of inquiry in this plaza full of people. Looks like this one hadn’t received an invitation to the discussion, but purely came to get in on the action, slipping in with a familiar face. Wu Wang wrinkled his brow. However, Great Master Wu Chen had a good temperament and patiently began to give him an outline: “The contents of the dream were that Tianlang-Jun, who had been suppressed under Bailu Mountain, had regained a flesh body, beginning to raise foul winds and bloodyrain 259 …” Though Great Master Wu Chen’s phrasing was elegant and full of hidden meaning, the contents were somewhat abridged. Going by Luo Binghe’s taste, those “foul winds and bloody rain” on his tongue definitely were not simple beatings and killings, they definitely left out many more heavy plays…"
"梦？ 不消说了。洛冰河干的好事！ 后者在沈清秋耳边轻声道： “ 师尊不是苦恼没有 ‘ 证据 ’ 么？这样就不必再费心了吧？ ” 怪不得当时他在修雅剑上昏睡了一瞬 , 沈清秋还以为他是体力不支，却原来是在那时候发 动了梦魇技能。 洛冰河眼神里满满的 “ 求表扬！ ” 、 “ 求摸头！ ” ，他假装没看见 , 视线挪开。 究竟洛冰河造了个什么样的梦境给他们 , 才会让事态严重到这么多人都忙不迭前来昭华寺 严肃讨论的地步呢 …… 用不着他问 , 有人先急躁了： “ 有没有人说一句 , 究竟是什么样的梦？ ” 这人看着眼熟得很 , 沈清秋思索一阵 , 忽然想起来了。这不是花月城那名 …… 什么宗来着、 哦, 霸气宗！霸气宗的大师兄吗！ 无尘大师客气道： “ 请问这位门主 , 您的修为？ ” 那人答道： “ 金丹后期！ ” 两位方丈对望一眼 , 不少人开始轻声咳嗽。 一阵莫名中 , 无尘大师出来做小明白了： “ 那 …… 这就奇怪了。在本寺中，所有金丹修为以 上者，都做了同一个梦 ……” 言下之意，如果他真是金丹后期 , 应该也做了这个梦才对 …… 底下纷纷附和： “ 不错 , 本门也是金丹以下的昨夜都无恙。 ” 众目睽睽之下谎报修为，还被当场拆穿，自己搬起石头砸自己的脚，沈清秋心里给这位过 了好些年仍没一点长进的仁兄点了个蜡。 可那名师兄这些年虽然修为没涨多少，脸皮却厚了不少，这样也还没害臊，大声道： “ 凡 事都有例外的嘛！倒不如说出来，究竟是什么梦？ ” 一个霸气宗，如此霸气侧漏的名字，居然一个达到金丹的修士也没有，不然他也不会在大 庭广众之下追问了。看来这位不是受邀共议，而是纯粹凑热闹混脸熟来的。无妄皱了皱眉 头，无尘大师却是个好脾气，耐心地给了个梗概： “ 梦境内容是，镇压在白鹿山下的天琅 君，重塑了肉身，掀起腥风血雨。 ” 依洛冰河的品味，无尘大师口里的 “ 腥风血雨 ” ，肯定不是简单的打打杀杀。绝对有不少重 口play ！ 无妄道： “ 一两个人做一样的梦，可以说是奇妙。几百人同时做一样的梦，连玄妙也不能 解释了。况且这梦非比寻常，逼真至极，醒来之后，甚至觉得现实也不如那梦境真实。 ” 在场金丹以上的修士对此都感同身受，心有余悸，纷纷颔首。 有人疑惑道： “ 这天琅君，到底是为何被镇压的？若他真这般可怕，当初又是如何被镇压 的？ ” 无尘大师叹道： “ 说起来，这也是一桩冤孽。幻花宫宫主如今若是在场，还不知要怎样唏 嘘。 ” 有女声讶然道： “ 幻花宫宫主？关洛冰河什么事？ ” 这声音娇媚清脆，婉转如莺啼，沈清秋闻声侧目。 说话的，乃是天一观众中一名身形窈窕的美貌道姑。 具体是那一名，沈清秋说不上来，因为有三名道姑从脸庞到身形装束，仿佛一个模子立刻 出来的，站在一起，仿佛三朵明媚的蓝花。甚至连神情，也都是同样不可言说的诡异 …… 兴奋。 没错的确是兴奋！ 洛冰河后宫里的孪生三姐妹！好久不见啦后宫们！ 要是在以前，沈清秋肯定又会激动不已，然后乐此不疲 yy 接下来推妹子的桥段。可是现在 …… 洛冰河声音压得很低，酸味仍飘了十里： “ 师尊，漂亮么？ ” 唉，不提也罢。沈清秋撤回目光。剧情改的乱七八糟后，那三名道姑此时应该不认识洛冰 河，却仍然对他相关信息表示了关切。沈清秋自动把她们脸上的兴奋解释为芳心萌动。洛 冰河的种马力，还是十分强悍的！ 无妄大师道： “ 阿弥陀佛。这里说到的宫主，指的是上一代老宫主。那洛冰河不过凭借阴 损手段夺得了主位，何德何能服众成为宫主？ ” 洛冰河一挑眉，不屑地撇了撇嘴。 无妄大师接着说了下去。 “ 不过，这其中渊源，确实与幻花宫脱不了干系。数十年前，老宫主座下有一首席弟子， 芳名苏夕颜。 ” 沈清秋精神为之一振。 这…… 这是要揭开洛冰河身世之谜的节奏！ “ 那时，老宫主膝下无子无女，对这亲传爱徒疼爱珍重有加，视为掌上明珠。无论行至何 处，都命苏夕颜随侍身旁，器重非常。 ” 沈清秋回忆起圣陵中老宫主双目呆滞，口水横流的模样，心想：恐怕不是视为掌上明珠， 是视为禁脔才对吧？随侍身旁，也不是因为什么 “ 器重 ” ，只是方便猥亵罢了。 大雄宝殿中，鸦雀无声，只有无妄大师一人的声音响彻。 “ 一次，老宫主与苏夕颜应求降服妖兽，回宫途径洛川下游一座旧城。蛇妖作乱，附近城 中人口所剩无几，师徒二人却遇上了一名孤身出入的青年。 “ 那青年气度不凡，容貌服色皆为上品，坐于垂柳之下，弹唱诗词。这样的人物，不应该 此时出现在此地，师徒二人初时好奇，便同他交谈了几句。问答往来一番，老宫主心觉此 人有异，绝非凡类，又摸不清底细，便催促爱徒不作理会，速速离去。苏夕颜却不明白师 父苦心，临走时还恋恋不舍。 ” 沈清秋听得津津有味。 原来天琅君真是个爱好人间诗词歌赋的文艺青年。把妹不用怕，就怕把妹的有文化。长一 张帅脸，歌不要唱的太吓人，一见钟情绝对可以有！ “ 回宫之后，不知怎么回事，苏夕颜开始频繁外出。她往日一直乖乖留守师父身旁，如今 却借口不断，老宫主先开始只是不满，抱怨几句，到后来她越走越远，不归的时日也越来 越长。 “ 老宫主觉察蹊跷，留心派人暗中跟随。谁知，派出去的弟子却总是被甩脱。终于，有一 次，老宫主亲自跟在了徒弟后面。这一跟，才弄清楚，她不回幻花宫的这些天，都在做什 么。 “ 苏夕颜和那日见到的奇特青年并肩坐在一起。两人偎依于一条青麟巨蛇头上，低声说 话。 ” 老宫主生怕惊动两人，在不近处便止步，隐隐约约听他们交谈。 “ 只听苏夕颜道： ‘ 你真要向我师父去说我们的事？你 …… 你敢么？ ’ 那青年漫不经心道： ‘ 为何不敢。 ’ 苏夕颜叹气： ‘ 你是魔界贵族啊。况且就算不为这个，师父怕是也不会答 应。 ’” 这苏夕颜真是生性柔顺，对老宫主仍师父相称。洛冰河作为这两个人的孩子，完美地遗传 了其母的圣母小白花气质，以及其父的没心没肺，变成了一个基因优秀的  精分蛇精 病。 “ 对话到这里，老宫主骇然，明白徒弟惹上了了不得的人物。震惊过后，继续探听，他们 已转过这一段。那魔族青年说： ‘ 待我血洗修真界，将他们杀个片甲不留，你还怕死人不 答应吗？ ’” 听到这最后一句，人群中传来齐刷刷倒吸冷气的声音。沈清秋却喷了。 前面的叙述，倒是还算画风正常。可最后一句是啥玩意儿？！ 怎么想也觉得天琅君不像是会说这些雄图霸业枭雄野望一类豪言壮语的角色！ 他嘴里冒出来的东西，不可能脑回路这么正常这么标准 boss 化！ 无妄大师继续语气平板地做复读机： “ 见苏夕颜受了惊吓，那青年又改口道： ‘ 只是逗逗你 罢了。 ’ 接下来，只说些风花雪月，顺便旁敲侧击，哄骗苏夕颜为他盗取幻花宫几间秘宝 ，说是看看就还。 ” 到这里，沈清秋基本上能够确定，后半段根本是老宫主别有用心胡编乱造的东西了。 呵呵呵呵，稀罕幻花宫那几件秘宝？ 天琅君可以随意出入魔族圣陵，里面的秘宝取之不尽用之不竭，人家都是闲得没事就在地 上摆个摊子套圈圈儿玩儿的好么？ 由此判定，这段转述，绝逼是老宫主本着私心，本着对抢走了他 “ 心爱宝贝 ” 的天琅君的极 端仇视，对这两人的情话添油加醋，断章取义，缺斤少两，一番编排的成果。 无妄语气带上了一点恨铁不成钢的意味： “ 女子一旦为情所迷，就容易昏了头脑，苏夕颜 果然满口应允。老宫主说，她看天琅君的眼神慕恋痴迷，而天琅君看他，却与看一般异族 并无二致。分明已被魔族哄骗的团团乱转，却仍执迷不悟！ “ 老宫主急在心头，一面暗中通知各门派首，商议合力围攻之计。一面将苏夕颜关在幻花 宫中，防止她走漏消息。 ” 有人愤愤斥责道： “ 这女子真是糊涂！师门养育栽培数十年，竟比不上一个男人几句花言 巧语。 ” 无妄道： “ 至于后来，就是白鹿山一战了。当日的情形，还是由在场出战的岳掌门转述为 好。 ” 岳清源微微顿首，道： “ 当日战况，其实并没有什么好说的。天琅君未曾料到前来的不是 苏夕颜，而是围攻者，身边只有座下一名魔将，唤作竹枝郎，陷入包围圈中，这才失手被 擒。 ” 如此，己方可以说是胜之不武了。他却坦然陈述，分毫不遮掩粉饰，沈清秋也真是佩服岳 清源。在场却有不少从小听师门前辈吹嘘白露山一战到大的人，首次听到真实版本，倍觉 尴尬。","CHAPTER 69: IN ZHAO HUA TEMPLE PART 2 Wu Wang said, “When one or two people have the same dream, it can already be considered to be peculiar. However, if several hundred people have the same dream at the same time, even the word ‘fantastical’ wouldn’t be able to explain this phenomenon. And this dream is completely out of the ordinary. It was too realistic. When you wake up, you would feel as if reality isn’t even as vivid as the sceneries from the dream.” The cultivators that were at core formation stage were all in agreement with the experience from the dream, and each of them nodded their heads at each other confusedly, hearts filled of terror. Someone questioned, “This Tianlang- Jun, why exactly was he sealed? If he really is this scary, in the past, how was he sealed?” Master Wu Chen sighed. “This is another enmity caused by sin. If the Palace Master of Huan Hua Palace was here today, there is no estimate to how much he would sigh with pity.” There was a woman’s voice full of astonishment. “Huan Hua Palace’s Palace Master? What does this have to do with Luo Binghe?” The voice was sweet and clear, like the song of a golden oriole. Shen Qingqiu’s gaze followed the sound of the voice. The one that was speaking was a slender, beautiful nun from the Tianyi Sect. As for which one, Shen Qingqiu was not able to say, because there were three nuns with the same face and outfit, like they came out of the same mold. When they stood next to one another, they looked like three astonishingly beautiful blue flowers. Even the feeling that they expressed was the same indescribable, peculiar feeling… of excitement. Yes, it really was the feeling of excitement. It was the three identical sisters in Luo Binghe’s Inner Palace. Long time no see, Inner Palace! If it was the past, Shen Qingqiu would definitely be overwhelmed with joy. He would then, on one hand, happily push for the scene where the protagonist would chase after a woman while on the other hand, aim a mouthful of complaints towards Airplane Shooting Toward the Sky. But now…. Luo Binghe’s voice was very deep and quiet, but the smell of vinegar has already drifted for over ten miles 260 . “Shizun, are they pretty?” Ai, fine, they don’t need to bring this up. Shen Qingqiu brought his gazeback. The plot has been changed into a jumbled mess and the three nuns weren’t made into containers for Luo Binghe so they shouldn’t be close to Luo Binghe. However, they still expressed concern when faced with information related to him. Shen Qingqiu automatically explained the excitement on their face as the blossoming affection of a young woman. Luo Binghe’s stallion power was still very powerful! Master Wu Wang said, “Amitabha. The Palace Master that we are speaking of is the Old Palace Master of the last generation. That Luo Binghe has utilized sinister means to obtain the title. How can he have the ability to serve as the Palace Master?” Luo Binghe lifted an eyebrow and unhappily slanted his mouth. Master Wu Wang continued speaking. “However, this situation is inseparable from the Huan Hua Palace. A few decades ago, the Old Palace Master had a chief disciple called Su Xiyan.” Shen Qingqiu’s spirit was trembling in excitement. Following this development, they are going to unravel the mystery surrounding the birth of Luo Binghe. “That woman had shocking talent, was intelligent and sensitive when making decisions, and she had the aura of a tyrant. The Old Palace Master loved and cared for this private disciple. He thought of her as a pearl that should be protected in his hands and trained her to be the next Palace Master of Huan Hua Palace. No matter where he went, he would bring Su Xiyan along with him. The importance that he placed in her was abnormal.” Shen Qingqiu thought back to the Old Palace Master in the Holy Mausoleum with his dull eyes and saliva flowing down his chin. He thought to himself that the Old Palace Master most likely did not think of Su Xiyan as a pearl that needed to be protected. The meat that was exclusively devoured by himself should be more accurate. In the Great Hall, no one made a sound. There was only the voice of Master Wu Wang. “On one occasion, the Old Palace Master and Su Xiyan followed the requests of a village and went to exterminate demonic creatures. When they were returning back to the Palace, they encountered an old city downstream from Luo Chuan. In that city, demons and other evil beings were running rampant. There was not many left of the city’s original population. However, Su Xiyan was able to meet a young man that was out alone in a tea house.” “That young man had an extraordinary aura coupled with a top gradeappearance. Sitting under a weeping willow, he was singing poetry overlapped by music. This type of character should not have appeared at such a place at such a time. At that time, Su Xiyan thought that it was strange. She had a brief conversation with that stranger and immediately deduced that this person had a goal and was definitely not ordinary.” Shen Qingqiu listened eagerly. Tianlang-Jun really was an artistic youth who loved the literary arts in the realms of humans since childhood. And what kind of artistic youth is the scariest? One that looks handsome who is also intelligent. If it was like this, then what happens next can be easily determined. As long as his singing didn’t make people feel too sorry for their ears, then the possibility of love at first sight was definitely possible. Who would have known that the plot would take a sharp turn for the worst? Su Xiyan immediately reported back to her shifu. As the Old Palace Master thought more on the subject, he also became more wary. When he noticed that the young man was affectionate towards Su Xiyan and that they were friendly enough to enjoy a conversation, the Old Palace Master decided to use this. He ordered her to get close to the other to get more information. Su Xiyan had quite a set of skills ━ she easily discovered that the young man wasn’t an ordinary person. He was the current ruler of the great demons that dominated the north and the south, Tianlang-Jun. Originally, many would think that in the meeting, the man had feelings while the woman had intentions; however, it actually pertained the internal affairs between the righteous and demonic sects. This wasn’t the common dramatic story of a nefarious Sacred Ruler of the demonic sect meeting a pure white flower. Instead, it was a story of an innocent king who didn’t know that human hearts were filled with evil intentions that met with a tyrannic flower with a heart that was both cold and dark. Shen Qingqiu finally understood the meaning behind the smile-yet-not- quite-a-smile that gave off the impression of being “cold and ruthless,” along with the odd tone of voice that Tianlang-Jun had when Shen Qingqiu mentioned Su Xiyan. “The Old Palace Master continued to let Su Xiyan pretend to get closer to Tianlang-Jun while he sent out other people to monitor the situation in the dark. Who would have known that the disciples that he sent out would all be avoided? The Old Palace Master had to personally head out. Finally, all the efforts had notbeen wasted ━ they finally discovered the reason Tianlang-Jun was staying in the Human realm. One day, Su Xiyan and Tianlang-Jun had a meeting on Bailu Mountain. They sat together on the head of a gigantic green snake as they talked quietly.” That giant green snake, if he didn’t guess wrong, was probably Zhuzhi- Lang. No matter how he thought of it, only Zhuzhi-Lang came to mind. Either as a nephew or as a subordinate, to be brought out on a date to be a seat cushion ━ no matter how you hear it, it sounded like Zhuzhi-Lang was way too pitiful! “The Old Palace Master, for fear of being discovered by Tianlang-Jun, hid nearby without daring to get too close and listened to their barely audible conversation. Su Xiyan patiently guided their conversation and took an indirect approach, coaxing Tianlang-Jun until he temporarily forgot himself enough to reveal his true purpose for sneaking into the human world: a massacre of the cultivation world in which every sect and faction’s treasures will be looted to strengthen the demon race’s power!” At the last sentence, there was the sound of the crowd gasping as one while Shen Qingqiu sighed. Frankly speaking, this type of typical and cliche BOSS-like reasoning wasn’t Tianlang-Jun’s style. He wasn’t the type of person who would come up with that kind of grandiose plan. Furthermore, as the Supreme Ruler, Tianlang- Jun could enter the demon race’s Mausoleum, a source of inexhaustible treasures, whenever he wished. This was a person who could arrange vendors’ stalls that were full of treasures in a circle on the ground to play with when he had nothing to do 261 . Would such a person really bother with the four sect’s few treasures? Shen Qingqiu had a lot of doubts about this story but Great Master Wu Wang continued: “The Old Palace Master immediately informed the sect master of every great sect about this matter. Tianlang-Jun met Su Xiyan twice a month at Bailu Mountain. All the sects agreed on a plan: on their next meeting, the sects would all join forces to encircle and suppress 262 Tianlang-Jun.” “As for what happened then, regarding the Battle of Bailu Mountain, it would be better for Sect Master Yue, who was present at the battle, to narrate the events of that day.” Yue Qingyuan said: “There’s not much to say about the situation on the battlefield that day. Tianlang-Jun didn’t expect that instead of Su Xiyan, he would encounter an attack from all sides 263 . There was only one demon general, Zhuzhi-Lang, with him who also got caught in the encirclement.Thus, in a manner of speaking, it could be said that their side won the battle. He spoke calmly, not making the slightest effort to whitewash the truth. There were many who had heard their seniors in the sect boasting about the Battle of Bailu Mountain since their childhood. When they heard the real story of the battle for the first time, they felt somewhat embarrassed. Yue Qingyuan said: “Because Zhuzhi-Lang protected his master, he was struck head-on by my master’s ‘Heaven’s Wrath 264 ’ technique. The spell wrapped around him and turned him back to his original, half-serpent form. He then fled. Tianlang-Jun was suppressed under Bailu Mountain.” So it turned out that the reason why Zhuzhi-Lang was in his half-serpent form at Luzhi Cave was because of the previous generation’s Qiong Ding Peak master’s heavenly thunderbolts. Based on Zhuzhi-Lang’s logic in which gratitude and grudges are clearly distinguished and the smallest grievance must be avenged… Shen Qingqiu didn’t have enough time to think about it because the System’s notification sound blared in his mind: Mission Released: Please help “Luo Binghe” complete the Zhao Hua Temple secondary story arc. Objective: The increase in reputation points 265 must not be less than 200 points! Reputation points? Shen Qingqiu suddenly remembered what the secondary story arc of Zhao Hua Temple was. At this point, Shen Qingqiu remembered Sha Hualing’s father Jiuzhong- Jun. This unfortunate demon noble had fallen on hard times when his selfish daughter, who didn’t know right from wrong and harmed her own family 266 , lost his territory. He spent some time roaming the southern lands gathering a motley crew, hoping to stage a comeback and take revenge on Luo Binghe. However, when he encountered the protagonist’s unbreakable halo, he couldn’t make either of his two glorious wishes come true… Since Jiuzhong-Jun’s plans were repeatedly foiled, he was nursing many grievances in his heart. What could he do about it? Of course, it was to vent his anger on someone else! And that “someone else” was none other than Zhao Hua Temple… This behavior was similar to Sha Hualing’s attack on Qiong Ding Peak. Having an exaggerated opinion of one’s abilities, not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth, they courted death. When Shen Yuan read that part of the novel, he mentally scoffed at this pair of father and daughter whose brain circuits seemed to wired in the same way.In the original novel, thanks to Jiuzhong-Jun sending a motley group of demon soldiers in the vicinity of Zhao Hua Temple to disturb the people and monks there, Zhao Hua Temple held a meeting, not to discuss the problem of Tianlang-Jun, but to sort out this troubled and depressed group of demons who were looking for others to notice their existence. However, the exact purpose for this meeting wasn’t important. What was more important was that this secondary story arc was indeed a way for Luo Binghe to improve his reputation. Jiuzhong-Jun’s tribe of demons mixed in with the crowd waiting for a chance to “teach those Buddhist monks 267 a lesson” (in the original novel’s words). Just a few seconds after they attacked, they were beautifully overwhelmed by Luo Binghe’s domineering pressure. Like this, his reputation was somewhat raised from “absolute evil” to “neither good nor evil.” Shen Qingqiu remained silent and looked around. Sure enough, among the crowd were some “people” who had a sinister look. Very well, the stage was set 268 ! Three beautiful Taoist nuns had an important role in this part of the original plot. These harem members were supposed act together 269 so that the efficiency of increasing reputation points was higher but now they have been relegated to the role of onlookers. Conclusion: The female lead’s roles were once again given to him, right? Wu Wang solemnly said: “In that dream, Tianlang-Jun rebuilt his body and bathed the human world in blood until the humans were in a terrible situation. This old monk thinks that this was his way of demonstrating his strength to us and a forewarning of his revenge for the Battle of Bailu Mountain.” Someone asked: “Since Tianlang-Jun’s original body has been damaged, even if he wants revenge, there’s nothing to be afraid of, right?” Wu Wang said: “You mustn’t underestimate Tianlang-Jun. He’s known as the Ancient Demon race’s most powerful heir, without equal among all the previous members of the past ruling dynasties. Moreover, in addition to his loyal and capable general Zhuzhi-Lang who has been restored to his original condition, he also has a son.”"
"岳清源道： “ 竹枝郎为护主 , 受我师尊天劫降罪之术正面击中，咒术缠身，半蜕回原形 , 变成 人不人蛇不蛇的模样 , 就地遁逃。天琅君则被镇压于白露山下。 ” 原来露芝洞那时竹枝郎的蛇男形态是被上一代穹顶峰峰主一个天雷轰顶轰成那样的 , 照他 那个恩怨分明睚眦必报的尿性 …… 沈清秋还没来得及想下去 , 系统滴滴叭叭发来提示： 【任务发布！请协助 “ 洛冰河 ” 完成昭华寺支线 , 目标：正面值提高不得少于 200 点！】 正面值？ 哦哦哦！沈清秋恍然大悟 , 终于想起来昭华寺是有什么剧情了！ 这里不得不提一提纱华铃她爹九重君。 这位倒霉的魔界贵族，被自家胳膊肘往外拐的女儿坑掉领地了以后 , 在南疆流浪了一段时 间，聚集了一帮乌合之众，指望东山再起，找洛冰河报仇雪恨。可遇上金刚不坏的男主光 环，他这辈子也别指望能完成这两个美好愿望的任何一个 …… 九重君的计划屡屡受挫 , 心里当然憋屈。憋屈怎么办？ 当然是找别人撒气！ 于是，这个 “ 别人 ”, 他找的是昭华寺 …… 这个行为，和当初纱华铃攻上穹顶峰一节，有异曲同工之妙。一般的不知天高地厚，上赶 着作死。沈垣看书当时就吐槽，不愧是亲父女，脑回路的清奇方式都这么雷同。 由于九重君派了一堆杂兵杂将在昭华寺附近一带扰民扰僧，原著中，昭华寺开会的原因， 不是为了对付天琅君，而是为了收拾这个乱找存在感的神烦落魄魔族。 不过，开会的目的不重要，重要的是，昭华寺，的确就是一段让洛冰河刷正面值的剧情。 九重君手下的魔族混入人群中伺机发难，想 “ 给这群秃驴点颜色看看 ” （原话），而他们才 发难了没几秒，就被洛冰河漂亮霸气地压了下来。如此展开，正面值当然多少能刷点。起 码能从 “ 十恶不赦 ” 刷成 “ 亦正亦邪 ” 。 沈清秋不动声色，眼珠转一转，果然在人群里，发现了一些神情不太对劲的 “ 人 ” 。 很好，道具都准备就绪了！ 三位美貌道姑原本也是这一段的重要角色，有后宫们里应外合，刷正面值的效率当然更 高。可是，现在她们已经变成了彻底的围观群众。 结论：所以就是又把女主的戏份加到劳资身上来了对吧 [ 手动拜拜 ] 无妄肃然道： “ 那梦境之中，天琅君凭借再造躯体，血洗人界，使至生灵涂炭。老衲以为 ，这是他对我们的示威，也是他对白鹿山一战复仇的前兆。 ” 有人道： “ 既然天琅君原本的肉身已经损毁，他即便是要复仇，也不足为惧吧？ ” 无妄道： “ 万万不可小觑天琅君。他是魔族内公认的天魔血系最强势的继承人，历代无出 其右者。况且，他手下除了有得力干将竹枝郎，还有一个儿子。 ” 众人纷纷交头接耳： “ 苏夕颜和他竟然有儿子？ ” “ 是谁？ ” 有的侧重点比较特殊，考虑到了生殖隔离： “ 人和魔族真能有后代么？ ” “ 长得都差不多，应该能有的吧。 ” 无妄道： “ 这个人，诸位都十分熟悉。正是方才提到过的，在幻花宫鸠占鹊巢的洛冰河！ ” 这一句话一出，殿中的窃窃私语瞬间涨成了轩然大波。 柳清歌也是一怔，难得在公共场合开口多说了几个字： “ 洛冰河是天琅君后人？ ” 沈清秋忍不住悄悄观察洛冰河。 起初的时候，洛冰河听着听着，还有心思调笑，越听到后来，越是严肃。此刻，笑容已完 全消失，脸看起来也有些苍白。只有一双眸子亮得发寒，如冰刺在瞳。 岳清源指节缓缓在玄肃剑柄上抚动，道： “ 我与苏夕颜数年前仙盟大会中有过一面之缘， 洛冰河相貌与其母有七分相似。原先也以为只是巧合，毕竟这世上容貌相似之人，为数不 少，可既然他还有一半天魔系的血统，这就无论如何也算不得巧合了。 ” 天一观一名老道惊疑不定： “ 老宫主将苏夕颜关押幻花宫中，一查之下，发现她已有身 孕。这我记得，可我还记得，这孩子是打去了的。 ” …… 我擦？！ 沈清秋头皮炸麻了。 这是啥。 这是啥！！！ 好像听到了了不得的东西？！ 那名霸气宗的男子又插嘴了： “ 这苏夕颜听来对天琅君十分爱慕痴迷，又怎舍得打去腹中 骨肉？ 无妄道： “ 的确，一开始老宫主软硬兼施，她也不肯听从命令。可如果，天琅君和洛冰河 ，只能二者取其一呢？ ” # 老公和儿子，究竟选谁？ # 沈清秋便是没想到，还能有这种类似保大保小的选择题。 无妄道： “ 苏夕颜在水牢关押期间，得知天琅君即将在白露山被围歼。老宫主对她说，若 肯服下药物，便能放她去和天琅君见面。苏夕颜便服了软，主动吃下了药物。 ” 洛冰河面无表情，手指却轻微地屈伸了几下。似乎是无意识的。 两人所站立的地方近旁，有人嘀嘀咕咕： “ 就算是为了给天琅君通风报信，这女子未免也 ……” “ 一个是尚未出世的孩子，一个是爱郎，两相权衡，当然是天琅君的性命更重要些。 ” 那名霸气宗的男子突然道： “ 慢着。这么说，苏夕颜服下了药物，你们却仍去围攻了天琅 君？ ” 忽然之间，大殿里鸦雀无声。 那人浑然不觉，接着说： “ 我就问问。不过，这不就是欺骗一个小姑娘吗？ ” 这位仁兄虽然每次都 ky ，但总算有一次 ky 的有点道理了。 打破这短暂沉默的还是无妄。 他白眉倒竖，合掌道： “ 与魔族私通得来的孽种，如何能留？若能除去这孽胎，什么手段 也不为过！只可恨那魔头生命强盛，即便是服用了药物，似乎也没能把胎儿除去。好在， 当年苏夕颜终究是没能赶上给天琅君报信。 ” 这一段话说得大义凛然，当下有人拍手大声叫好。无尘大师面露不忍之色，双手合十，直 念佛号。 不是没人觉得这样未免残忍，可听了无妄刚才那番话，再一想，那腹中的胎儿可是洛冰河 ，有什么值得同情的？于是，也跟着叫好喝彩了。 洛冰河垂着眼睫，像在听，又像已经神思游离。这几天原本逐渐在软化的轮廓重新变得冷 如冰雕。 大雄宝殿中这些人，正在为他的不死而咬牙切齿，为想象中他的死亡而欢呼叫好，他却仿 佛一句都听不到。 沈清秋心头不详的预感越发浓厚。 这个地方本来应当是这种发展：掌门们严肃地商议如何对付天琅君 → 突然出现捣乱挑衅的 魔族 → 洛冰河单挑魔族刷正面值和好感度。 可因为一群八卦人士聊着聊着，扒出了洛冰河的身世，导致重点出现了偏差。 看着一语不发的洛冰河，他现在有点后悔了。 也许，昭华寺这个任务，不该接的。 无尘大师叹气道： “ 其实又何必这么说？如果不是万不得已，哪个为人娘亲的愿意打下自 己的孩子？苏施主流落在外，老宫主爱徒之心不减，派人不懈寻找，终是不见踪影 ……” 无妄斥道： “ 师弟莫要胡乱心慈，在金兰城你被害至那般地步，就该明白魔族何其险恶。 这一对父子蓄谋已久，联手卷土重来，妄图覆灭我等。纵容他们不是仁善，不过妇人之仁 ，下场只会比那梦境中更为悲惨！ ” 这无妄和尚修为虽高，戾气却太重，除了少了点头发，身上佛性无几。不该拿法杖，应该 拿板斧。倒是无尘虽然功力平平，却心慈平和，更担得起 “ 大师 ” 这两个字，即便被斥责也 不改色，更不改口： “ 蓄谋联手，这 …… 也未必吧？ ” 这边昭华寺两位方丈扯不清楚，岳清源却忽然道： “ 无论他们联手与否，有一点是肯定 的。洛冰河绝非善类。 ” 他扬起声音： “ 清秋，还不出来？ ” 沈清秋背脊一毛。磨蹭了几秒，这才慢慢站了出来。 他有种小学生上课被老师点名批评的感觉，脸皮底下有点辣，不过好在脸皮厚，泰然自若 ，躬身一礼： “ 掌门师兄。 ” 既然注意到他，那他身旁的那位就更藏不住了。当即有人惊呼： “ 洛冰河！是洛冰河！ ” “ 真是他！什么时候混进来的？！ ” “ 沈清秋也在。他真没死啊？！ ” “ 当初花月城我可是亲眼见他自爆的 ……” 这些声音大多是如见恶鬼的语气，其中却混杂了几个娇柔的女声，正是天一观那三名美貌 道姑。三人互相捉紧对方手臂，脸泛起不自然的红晕。奇怪的是，这些红晕有的好像还是 对着沈清秋泛的 …… 岳清源坐着看他，淡淡地问： “ 这些日子，胡闹够了？ ” 岳清源从没用这么严厉的态度同他说话过。 “ 胡闹 ” 这个程度的词，相当于是在打板子。看 来刚才柳清歌没少说他坏话。 沈清秋发誓总有一天要把乘鸾偷过来切遍整个十二峰厨房的猪腿肉，切得油光盖满剑光。 掰回剧情！掰回剧情好吗！拜托你们把注意力放在混入寺中的魔族身上行不行！ 这样还怎么刷正面值！ 他刚要动点手脚，让旁人注意到那些伪装成杂派弟子者的异常之处，无妄法杖在地上猛地 一顿，冷笑道： “ 洛冰河，你自己送上门来，倒也省事。不如直说，天琅君打算何时实践 他梦境中的所作所为？ ” 洛冰河冷冷地说： “ 那是他要做的事，与我何干。 ” 旁人哼哧： “ 你们可是父子，你说与你何干？ ” 洛冰河漠然道： “ 他不是我父亲。 ” 无妄道： “ 铁证如山，还要狡辩，就没什么意思了。 ” 洛冰河摇了摇头，不知道在执着些什么，只是重复： “ 他不是我父亲。 ” 无妄哼道： “ 真是祸害遗千年，苏夕颜当初若是把你除了下来，倒也干净！ ” 这话未免恶毒。洛冰河呼吸仿佛停滞了一瞬，眼底隐隐有血色闪过。沈清秋顾不得多想， 一把捉住了他的手。 柳清歌抱手站在岳清源身后，看他众目睽睽去牵洛冰河，额头有根青筋跳了跳： “ 喂！ ” 柳清歌一恼怒、又不想多说话，就会喂一声，完全没有威胁力，沈清秋直接无视掉。要是 洛冰河在这种场合发作，那可不是好玩儿的。不光是正面值能不能刷上去的问题，关键在 于，昭华寺副本，不好硬打！ 用灵力，在场几百个人一起拿灵力打他一个，够呛；用魔气，这里可是结界高手如云的昭 华寺，最擅长的就是封魔。硬打，智商岂非沦落到跟省略号父女一个水平线。 洛冰河冷冰冰地道： “ 苏夕颜是谁？我母亲只是一名洗衣妇。 ” 沈清秋低声说： “ 无妄的转述不尽不实，老宫主是什么人你更清楚，这两人加工过的陈年 旧事，可信度很值得商榷。通通都先忘掉！ ” 他用的是对徒弟训示的语气，尽量冷静客观。洛冰河拖住他一条手臂，像是在求证，又像 是自证： “ 师尊，天琅君不是我父亲。我不需要父亲。 ” 沈清秋不知该说什么，只能握紧他的手，示意他先稳住。 原著中，洛冰河的身世并没有揭露的这么细，所以沈清秋无法判断这件事对洛冰河的打击 有多大，但恐怕不是几句安慰几下摸头就能解决的。 长久以来心存的微弱期待和幻想都毫不留情地被尽数粉碎。父不父，子不子，只字不提， 在圣陵里也毫不手软。母亲更是做出了明确的选择。虽然艰难，但那终归也是选择。 洛冰河，是不被至亲所需要的。 沈清秋只顾唏嘘，却忘了中未挑明的一大铁的定律。 这个定律还是他自己总结出来的： 每次受过打击、领略了世界的恶意之后，男主的黑化程度，都会自暴自弃地更上一层楼 ……","CHAPTER 70: IN ZHAO HUA TEMPLE PART 3 Everyone was stunned and began whispering amongst themselves: “Su Xiyan actually had a child with that person? “Who was it? “Wasn’t she just instructed to deceive Tianlang-Jun? How is it possible…” Some were more interested in the aspect of reproductive compatibility: “Can humans and demons really produce offspring?” “Physically, it’s not that big of a difference. It’s probably feasible.” Wu Wang said: “Su Xiyan may have approached Tianlang-Jun on her master’s orders, but if she had not been tempted to begin with, how could she have been swayed? My humble self believes she was initially able to restrain herself, but demons have always excelled at deception. Without constant vigilance, a single misstep will cause you to fall under the demon’s wiles and lead to a lifetime of regret. She was already pregnant around the time of the siege. As for the child born from the two of them, you are all here well acquainted with him. It is no other than the one you were just discussing ━ the Luo Binghe who has seized and taken over Huan Hua Palace!” As soon as the words left his mouth, the muted whispers in the temple suddenly rose to a roar. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but quietly observe Luo Binghe. In the beginning, Luo Binghe only listened and even had the mood to chuckle. But the more he heard, the more serious he grew. Right now, his smile had completely faded and his face was pale. Only his eyes were dark and wintry. Yue Qingyuan’s knuckles slowly brushed against the hilt of the Xuan Su sword as he spoke: “I have met senior 270 Su Xiyan once a few years ago during the Immortal Alliance Conference. Luo Binghe certainly bears a strong resemblance to his mother. Initially, I put it off as mere coincidence. After all, in this whole wide world, there are many who share similar features. But for him to carry half of the blood of a demon, it can no longer be a coincidence.” The man from BaQi Sect butted in again: “If she had been forced, then it’s not her fault. But why, knowing that she was carrying the child of that demon, did she give birth to it?” Someone else agreed immediately: “That’s right, if she hadn’t given birth, we wouldn’t be plagued by this Luo Binghe. Why didn’t Su Xiyan terminate the pregnancy?” “Tis a shame, really a shame! It’s no wonder I have never heard of thisperson called Su Xiyan. It’s only natural to hide such a scandal. Having a traitor within your midst ━ if they didn’t settle the matter themselves, how can they still face their sect master?” Hearing this, Great Master Wu Chen seemed to have something to say but hesitated. He shook his head slightly and finally said: “Originally, this matter involves a lady’s reputation; moreover, benefactor 271 Su has passed away. However, this matter is not simple. It should not remain hidden, else this issue will remain unresolved. The blood of the demon race is strong, and the fetus the mother carries is tied to her lifeline. At that time, attempting to abort the fetus would have carried a very high risk…. Benefactor Su had a proud heart; this was unacceptable to her. In her state, she wouldn’t tolerate the stares of strangers. The Old Palace Master gave her a drug that was harmful to the demon race. After she took it, she left Huan Hua Palace and disappeared. Buddha is merciful. May the rest of you be mindful of your words.” Luo Binghe remained expressionless, but his fingers flexed and clenched unconsciously. Near where they both stood, some people whispered furtively: “A child spurned by his own mother even before birth ━ not an ounce of mercy spared for her own flesh and blood. It’s amazing how women can be so cold-blooded.” “That’s right, if she hadn’t been so ill-fated as to fall for Tianlang-Jun’s wiles, she would have had such a bright and promising future and be a person of great renown today.” “I don’t care what fantastic rewards are promised to me ━ having an affair with a demon and getting knocked up with a monster child is just plain disgusting. This kind of merit, I wouldn’t accept even if it was served to me on a silver platter.” “Su Xiyan was probably too ashamed to remain, and thus ran away from the sect master.” The man from BaQi Sect suddenly said: “So from the beginning till the end, there are no facts or evidence pertaining to Tianlang-Jun, and this all rests solely on what the Old Palace Master has told us about Tianlang-Jun?” The hall fell silent. The man was oblivious and continued: “I’m just airing my thoughts; you guys can just listen. But, are you really going to launch an offensive just based on the Old Palace Master’s side of the story? Why do I get the feeling that, from the beginning till the end, these are the actions of a jilted lover? Moreover, letting a girl approach a dangerous demon, teaching her to be deceitful, andgiving her poison for the abortion, and in the end causing her to leave with grievances ━ I feel it’s rather despicable. Us from the BaQi Sect would have never done that.” His words surprised Shen Qingqiu somewhat. Really couldn’t tell that this dear fellow, who seemed to be perpetually ky 272 , could still sometimes talk sense even while he was being ky. It seemed that his IQ was not at the same level as that of the normal supporting characters. In the end, it was Wu Wang who broke the stilted silence. His white brows bristled disapprovingly as he rebuked: “Foolishness! From time immemorial, demons have been attacking the human world. Would you have us regret our inaction only after Tianlang-Jun has bathed the earth in blood? Moreover, as the head of one of the four major sects 273 , how would it benefit the Old Palace Master of the Huan Hua Palace to deceive everyone so maliciously? As for the bastard born of this illicit affair with the demon, we definitely cannot allow him to live! It is regrettable that the demon was able to survive the poison and was not aborted as a fetus!” This statement was delivered with a strong sense of righteousness and was immediately greeted with claps and cheers. Great Master Wu Chen clasped his hands together as he recited a prayer, disapproval writ large on his face. It wasn’t that no one felt such a pitiless act wasn’t particularly cruel, but having heard Wu Wang’s stirring speech, as well as influenced by the mood of the gathering, their thoughts had shifted. The fetus was Luo Binghe, after all, ━ why should they spare it any sympathy? And so, they also cheered along. Luo Binghe’s eyelids were lowered, his gaze hooded. He seemed to be listening still, but his mind had already drifted elsewhere. His features, which had been gradually softening in these past few days, were now glacial again. The people gathered in the Hall of Great Strength 274 were now gnashing their teeth over his escape from death, and exclaiming over how good it would have been if he had died in the womb. All this fell on deaf ears. According to the ideal flow of the script, in this location, the plot should have developed thus: the leaders gather to seriously discuss how to coordinate and deal with Tianlang-Jun → the sudden appearance of demons hellbent on wreaking havoc → Luo Binghe single-handedly defeat the demons in the ambush, and brush up on the feelings of goodwill. But because of this group of gossipy hens who brought up Luo Binghe’s background story, the focus has shifted. Eyeing Luo Binghe who remained mute, Shen Qingqiu suddenly regrettedhis decision. He should not have accepted the mission of Zhao Hua Temple. Great Master Wu Chen sighed: “Why are such words necessary? Benefactor Su, ai, benefactor Su was a single lady who lived on her own outside. The Old Palace Master sent out people to search for her for years in vain ━ who knows how much she had suffered before her death? The blood flowing in Luo Binghe’s veins may be half demon, but Luo Binghe has never caused any grievous harm….” Wu Wang rebuked him: “Shidi should not be so carelessly merciful. You almost lost your life back in Jinlan City. You should well understand the sinister hearts of demons. Against them, it is always best to take the pre-emptive course of action. This father and son duo have been planning for a long time ━ they will join hands and make a comeback to wreak destruction on us. Tolerating their existence is not an act of mercy, but a show of womanly weakness. The final outcome will be worse than anything you can dream of!” Although this monk Wu Wang’s cultivation was decent, he was too bellicose. Aside from not having hair, he did not radiate the sense of enlightenment that marked those who practiced Buddhist ethics. An ax would suit his temperament better than the abbot’s staff 275 . Unlike Wu Chen, whose skills were average but has a kind and peaceful heart, he was more worthy of bearing the title of “Great Master.” Even in the face of such harsh criticism, he remained serene, and did not back down: “Joining hands against us, this… is mere conjecture, no?” It was unclear how long the two abbots of Zhao Hua Temple intended to continue wrangling. Yue Qingyuan suddenly spoke up: “Whether they join forces or not is up for debate, but one thing is certain: Luo Binghe is not a good person.” He raised his voice: “Qingqiu, still not coming out?” Shen Qingqiu’s hair stood on end 276 . He dawdled for a bit, before slowly standing up. There was the sensation of being a primary school student who has been singled out by the class teacher for a scolding. His face felt hot, but he was fortunately thick-skinned enough to maintain a calm and unruffled appearance. He bowed in greeting: “Zhangmen-shixiong.” Since he has been called out, attention would also be drawn to the one next to him. Sure enough, someone immediately exclaimed: “Luo Binghe! It’s Luo Binghe!”“It really is him! When did he enter?” “Shen Qingqiu is here too. Isn’t he supposed to be dead?” “But I saw him self destruct at Huayue City with my own eyes….” The hubbub was as noisy as all hell, but mixed in it were the soft and delicate voices of women. They were the three beautiful Taoist priestesses from Tian Yi Monastery. The three women clasped at each other’s arms, their faces strangely flushed. Stranger still was that their maidenly shyness seemed to be directed at Shen Qingqiu…. Yue Qingyuan gazed at him while seated, and asked bluntly: “Are you done with this buffoonery 277 ?” Yue Qingyuan has never spoken to him so harshly before. For him to use the word “buffoonery” was on the same level as administering a heavy beating 278 . It seems like Liu Qingge had been very enthusiastic while bad- mouthing him. Shen Qingqiu vowed to one day steal Cheng Luan and use it to slice all the pork legs in the Twelve Peaks’ kitchens until the sword’s bright gleam was smothered under layers of grease. Follow the script, follow the script, okay? I’m begging you to please turn all your attention to the demons who have already broken into the temple, alright! How am I supposed to increase the values of goodwill! He was about to make a move to draw their notice to the suspicious figures who had infiltrated the ranks of the various sects disguised as their disciples, when Wu Wang slammed the butt of his staff on the ground, sneering: “Luo Binghe, you’ve saved us quite some trouble by delivering yourself to our doorsteps. Why not just tell us what Tianlang-Jun has dreamt up for us this time?” Luo Binghe replied icily: “That is his business, not mine.” Someone spoke up: “He is your father ━ dare you say it’s not your business as well?” Luo Binghe remained indifferent: “He’s not my father.” Wu Wang said: “In the face of overwhelming truth, you’re still trying to evade. Do you think all of us here are gullible children?” Luo Binghe shook his head stubbornly as he repeated: “He’s not my father.” Wu Wang snorted: “You really are the scourge of the century. If Su Xiyan had gotten rid of you back then, it would have saved everyone a lot of grief!” The vicious words struck a nerve. Luo Binghe’s breath caught in his throatfor a moment, his eyes reddening. Without a second thought, Shen Qingqiu caught hold of his hand. Liu Qingge had been standing behind Yue Qingyuan with his arms crossed. Seeing him openly move to Luo Binghe’s side under everyone’s watchful gaze, a vein jumped on his forehead: “Hey!” Liu Qingge was too irritated to say more and only barked out sharply once. However, it didn’t deter Shen Qingqiu, who willfully ignored it. It definitely wouldn’t be fun if Luo Binghe flew into a rage here and now. It’s not just a question of whether the feelings of goodwill can be increased. The crux was, in the novel’s Zhao Hua Temple chapter 279 , they had to tread carefully. If spiritual power was used, the hundreds of people present could pulp them with one collective blow; using demonic power, there were countless masters of spell arrays from Zhao Hua Temple who were most skilled in sealing away demon magic. It’s not like his IQ has fallen to the level of the Sha Hualing father and daughter pair. Luo Binghe said coolly: “Who is Su Xiyan? My mother is just a laundry woman.” Shen Qingqiu said softly: “Wu Wang’s words are without basis. You should know by now what kind of person the Old Palace Master was. The credibility of these people’s stories about what happened in the past is debatable. Just forget about it!” He used the tone of a master instructing his disciple, striving to appear calm and objective. Luo Binghe tugged at his arm, as if seeking proof and validation: “Shizun, Tianlang-Jun is not my father. I don’t need a father.” Shen Qingqiu didn’t know what to say. He could only grip his hand and motion for him to calm down first. Originally, Luo Binghe’s past was not sketched out in such detail. Shen Qingqiu really couldn’t predict how big of an impact it would be on Luo Binghe, but it was unlikely to be something that could be resolved with a few comforting words and pats on the head. The faint dreams and fantasies he had long held have been mercilessly crushed to powder. Father and son refuse to recognize each other. Tianlang-Jun, as a pure-blooded demon, has never had any concept of familial ties. Add to the fact that he has suffered at the hands of humans and Su Xiyan, that hatred has been spread to Luo Binghe. There was no mention of the relationship between the two in the Holy Mausoleum and no tenderness either. And towards this father and son pair, Su Xiyan had also long made her choices clear through heractions: deceiving, exploiting, loathing, rejecting, viewing them as disgraceful, and abandoning them. Luo Binghe was not a wanted child. Wu Wang frowned: “As expected of a demon, to be able to utter such words.” Luo Binghe turned a deaf ear to him: “If he is my father, why didn’t he mention it?” At most, when he had been beating up Luo Binghe, he had said off- handedly: “Looks like his mother.” And? What else? There had been nothing else. Shen Qingqiu was silent. Personally, he thought that it was most likely because… Tianlang-Jun was truly a nutcase? This was all wrong. Shen Qingqiu hurriedly turned around, saying: “Everyone, please don’t be hasty. Luo Binghe is not here at Zhao Hua Temple today to cause trouble, nor does he have any ill intent…” Great Master Wu Chen echoed: “That’s right, Shixiong may wish to listen to Peak Lord Shen.” Shen Qingqiu threw him a grateful look, but Wu Wang sneered: “No ill intent? How do you explain this then?” His voice rose to a shout on the last word. Dozens of warrior monks in red gold robes suddenly popped up within the crowd, seizing and twisting several people to the ground. From the bodies of the people who were pinned down, black qi slowly swirled out. Naturally, the scene was thus: “There are demons rushing in!” “Luo Binghe, you’ve really come well prepared!” This development was FUBAR! These disorderly lackeys of Jiuzhong-Jun were originally supposed to be used to brush up the goodwill towards Luo Binghe, but has now been turned around to implicate him instead, with Luo Binghe deemed as the mastermind of this ambush! With great foresight, he whipped out his folding fan and, sure enough, Wu Wang’s staff came crashing heavily against it. Shen Qingqiu lifted the fan a little, unyieldingly holding it against the staff in mid-air."
"无妄皱眉道： “ 果然是魔族 , 这种话都说得出口。 ” 洛冰河充耳不闻： “ 如果他是我父亲，为什么不提。 ” 充其量只是在殴打洛冰河的时候，不含褒贬地说了一句 “ 像他母亲 ” 。 像, 然后呢？ 就没有了。 沈清秋被问得哑口无言： 我怎么知道为什么！ 最大的可能就是因为天琅君真的是个神经病吧？ 气氛不太对，沈清秋没空大吐其槽 , 他转身道： “ 请诸位稍安勿躁 , 这次洛冰河出现在昭华 寺, 并非是为挑衅或心怀不轨 ……” 无尘大师附和道： “ 不错 , 师兄不妨先听沈峰主一言。 ” 沈清秋感激地看他一眼，无妄冷笑 道： “ 不是心怀不轨？那这是什么？ ” 最后一句 , 他是喝出来的。人群中忽然冒出几十个身穿赤金僧袍的武僧 , 扭住了一堆人，按 到地上。 被擒住的人身上慢慢溢出黑气。顺理成章的，现场一片： “ 有魔族混进来了！ ”xn “ 洛冰河果然是有备而来！ ”xn 这发展！坑爹呢！ 沈清秋要泪奔了。 九重君这些乱七八糟的手下原来是用来给洛冰河刷正面值的道具 , 结果起到了完全相反的 作用，被当成是和洛冰河一伙的埋伏了！ 他很有先见之明地抽出折扇，果然，下一刻，无妄的法杖便沉沉砸了过来。沈清秋举扇一 点，生生让那法杖在半空顶住。他用的力道很有分寸，刚好可以和无妄形成僵持，还有空 回头匆忙对洛冰河说了一句： “ 交给为师！ ” 刚要继续说点场面话，无妄当头斥道： “ 沈清 秋，你也和苏夕颜一样，让魔族迷了心智吗？身为一峰之主，多少要知点廉耻！ ” 沈清秋脚底一滑，险些没顶住。 这性质能一样吗？！？！ 他好不容易调整了扭曲的面部表情，谁知，洛冰河对着无妄就是一掌劈下。 雄孩子又来舔乱！沈清秋在扇尖灌入灵力，震开无尘的法杖： “ 不是说了交给我吗？！ ” 洛冰河满面阴霾： “ 他可以说我，但不能说你！ ” 几句话的功夫，二人已被大雄宝殿中服色各异的修士们团团包围住。果然，一用魔气就特 别容易引发敌意。无妄一挥法杖： “ 岳掌门，这魔头还口口声声叫沈清秋为师尊，沈清秋 也不加以否认，你怎么看？还承认洛冰河是苍穹山派门下吗？ ” 岳清源不答，脸上看不出喜怒哀乐，语气也不起不伏，仍稳稳坐着： “ 清秋，回来。 ” 沈清秋下意识朝他走了一步，心想不如先认个错，让老大消消火。岳清源如果能站到他这 边，绝对镇得住场子。可他人还没过去，洛冰河便一把拽住他： “ 别过去！ ” 沈清秋刚张了张嘴，洛冰河又说： “ 别过去。 ” 语气中竟带上了点哀求的意味。沈清秋正要 说话，数百道剑气灵光齐齐冲着包围圈中心的两人打去。 柳清歌瞳孔骤缩，乘鸾应声出鞘，正要护住沈清秋，忽然，整个大雄宝殿都震动了起来。 一层白电黑电滋滋交错流转的光罩爆开！ 震动过后，地上东倒西歪一片，大约只剩四分之一的人或站或靠。洛冰河双眼红得白日发 亮，仿佛熊熊燃烧的炙热岩浆，襟袖裹挟着黑气翻卷不息。 被按在地上的一名魔族放声大笑： “ 果然不要脸，对付天琅君时用围殴这下限法子，今天 还用！ ” 洛冰河单手揽着沈清秋，一字一句道： “ 你们围攻我随意。可我师尊做了什么，要跟我一 起被围击？ ” 他其实没受伤，刚才震得太厉害，刚踉跄了下，就被洛冰河扶住拖进臂弯里护着了，正想 继续调停，无妄道： “ 你喊他师尊，他不否认，难道这还不够？ ” 这秃驴！ 沈清秋皮笑肉不笑： “ 沈某否不否认，与尔何干？ ” 他将手中折扇转得飞起，从各种奇葩角度袭来的刀剑不断被扇子击飞，噼里啪啦之声不绝 于耳。一个转身，忽见岳清源一手按在玄肃剑柄上，迎面过了来。 他当场手一软，差点把折扇直直抛飞了出去。跟岳清源打？别闹！ 谁知，岳清源单手举起玄肃，并没对准沈清秋，而是打偏了几寸。耳边铛的一声巨响，沈 清秋猛一扭头。玄肃剑柄和无妄的法杖卡成一团，杠上了。 无妄打不着洛冰河，居然改成朝他后脑打了，卧槽！ 岳清源虽然插【入了混战，却并不攻击战圈中心的两个靶子，而是有一搭没一搭帮沈清秋 挡个刀什么的。掌门下水，柳清歌也跟着混了进来。两人一阵乱打，都是差不多的德性， 谁都打，就是不打沈清秋，纯属添乱，要命的是添乱的还是两个高手，出手又准又狠。无 妄终于忍无可忍，怒道： “ 柳峰主！ ” 柳清歌一剑把天一观众道人的拂尘通通削成秃掸子，面无表情地说： “ 手误。 ” 无妄气得胡子倒翘： “ 岳掌门！ ” 在岳清源把无妄砸向沈清秋的法杖砸开三次之后，岳掌门也淡淡地道： “ 眼花。 ” 在场众人不约而同默默想：苍穹山派护短派之说，果然名不虚传！ 一个手误可以解释，两个手误怎么回事？一次眼花可以理解，打自加入进来就一直在眼花 ，还能不能好好打架了，你们到底是站在哪一边的！ (  □′)   ┻━┻ 两位这是在用实际行动告诉其他人：打架，可以；欺负清静峰峰主，不行！ 沈清秋反手推了一把洛冰河： “ 想死？先走！ ” 洛冰河不但没被推开，反而捉住他手腕： “ 师尊，我们走。一起走！ ” 沈清秋没回头看他表情，一来无暇，二来也不大忍心，抽手催促： “ 还不动！让你走就走 ，听话！ ” 他不知道能拖住旁人多久，更不可能抛下这种混乱的局面跟洛冰河先跑路。岳清源他们放 水放的太明目张胆，无妄已经动怒，自己和洛冰河两人总得留一个，不然昭华寺和苍穹山 派之间又要生出龃龉。 片刻的沉默之后，洛冰河轻声说： “…… 好。 ” “ 既然是师尊你说的。 ” 下一刻，他就落在了大雄宝殿外的广场之上。 这速度太快了，快得恐怖，一时之间，众人居然忘了收回兵刃追着打下去。无妄叫道： “ 布界！ ” 数名僧人向广场抄去。沈清秋迅捷无伦拔出修雅，打个响指，剑身横冲直撞，把他们的阵 型和步伐扰得乱七八糟。他喊道： “ 为师先回苍穹山，之后再去找你。 ” 洛冰河有梦魇技能 ，想见面什么时候都不是问题，倒头大睡就行。后半句其实是在安抚洛冰河，意思是到时 候再好好安慰一下他受伤的心灵，可就这么当着人说出来，难免有点心虚，沈清秋忍不住 偷瞄了下苍穹山那边的两位。 见状，洛冰河嘴角扯了扯，露出了一个奇怪的微笑。 不少人看到他这个笑容，都一个寒噤，心中无端端得慌。 洛冰河缓缓道： “ 我会回来接你的。 ” 话音未落，他身形便消失在殿外。 人一不见，无妄发出一声懊恼的呔声。沈清秋却松了口气，立刻把修雅召回入鞘。 他解剑横持，双手托到岳清源面前： “ 方才形势紧急，清秋不得已，对在场诸位多有冒犯 ，请掌门师兄责罚。 ” 岳清源把剑推了回去： “ 人回来了，责罚一事，回苍穹山再议。 ” 沈清秋窥他脸色。 岳清源虽然看着十分严肃，但从刚才混战中的行为来看 …… 果然只是在外人面前做做样 子。 “ 回苍穹山再议 ” ，不就等于 “ 这件事就这么算了咱们回去吃饭吧 ” 一样吗 …… 自家掌门的确好说话，可无妄哪有这么好打法。洛冰河在众目睽睽之下被放跑了，虽然主 要得怪三位峰主搅混水，可昭华寺怎么说也有点丢脸，他合掌道： “ 这件事恐怕不能这么 算了吧？沈峰主多少要有个交待。或者，苍穹山一定要代沈峰主有个交待！ ” 有人在角落里尖声尖气： “ 方才说苏夕颜糊涂，师门恩义竟比不上一个男人几句花言巧 语。这沈清秋更糊涂，用不着洛冰河花言巧语，便这般不知轻重。 ” 沈清秋只当没听见，岳清源客气道： “ 苍穹山派的人，岳某自会管教。相信一定会给诸位 一个交待。 ” 无尘大师欣然道： “ 阿弥陀佛，那就最好不过。相信岳掌门和沈峰主一定能把此事平息。 ” 无妄哼了一声，还要责难： “ 那倒未必。莫非诸位都忘了，金兰城撒种人一事，其实沈峰 主还是没给出交待？在幻花宫水牢关押不久，便潜逃出外，之后在花月城更是假死遁。此 事至今苍穹山还没给出详细解释，如果这就是沈峰主和贵派的 ‘ 交待 ’ ，老衲实在不敢恭 维。 ” 他旧事重提，沈清秋却神游天外，压根没在听。 系统都发来红色警告了，谁踏马还有心思听老和尚炒冷饭翻旧账！！！ 系统：【 “ 昭华寺 ” 支线截止，数值统计：正面值 200 。任务完成情况：彻底失败！】 达到 200 了，不过不是 +200 ，是 200 ！ 这算是他跟系统拉拉扯扯了这么久以来，第一次任务失败。失败得彻底！ 沈清秋忙问： “ 失败有什么后果来着？ ” 突然，脑中袭来一阵尖锐的疼痛和剧烈的眩晕。 系统：【任务失败！请贵方做好准备， 60 秒之内将遣送您回到原世界。】 想起来了，任何一项数值低于 0 就会被遣回！ 沈清秋咆哮： “ 别啊草！这就直接送回原世界了？！我原账号注销了你不知道吗？！只是 一次失败而已，我爽度值那么高难道不能抵消一点吗？ b 格呢？！ b 格也很高啊！这么高总 得有点用吧？！ ” 他脑内排山倒海，脸上也变幻莫测，青白红绿交替，看上去随时要呕吐或者晕倒的样子， 柳清歌注意到他神情不对： “ 你怎么了？ ” 系统：【是否付出目前全部爽度，购买其他惩罚方式？】 沈清秋： “ 买买买！多贵都买！ ” 叮！系统：【购买成功。爽度清零。请注意余额。惩罚加载中。】 粉红色的爽度条真的变成 0 了 …… 呵呵，看来是等不到月结算的时候让爽度的数字震惊自 己的那一天了。这已经是第二次清零了 [ 手动拜拜 ] 第二次！ 沈清秋脑瓜是不疼了，可头还是晕。 岳清源也发觉他不对劲了： “ 刚被打中了？ ” 柳清歌一手抓住他，让他站稳，一面抬头，问： “ 谁打的？ ” 百战峰峰主发问，众人忙不迭纷纷摇头。 装的吧？！谁能打中沈清秋？！就刚才那情况，谁被打沈清秋也不可能被打好吗？！三个 人都明里暗里护着的是谁啊！还好意思晃！只有他打别人的份！ 外界的争执声越来越嘈杂。沈清秋晕着晕着，两眼一黑，在岳清源和柳清歌的中间，咚的 一声。 真倒了。 再睁开眼睛时，已经不在昭华寺了。 沈清秋环顾四周，空无一人。 这该是梦境吧？ 可是，一般来说，他现在只要做梦，场景一定是清静峰，因为他和洛冰河梦境相连，后者 最喜欢用的梦境地图就是清静峰。 沈清秋又走了一阵，仔细观察，猛然发觉，这个这方的确是清静峰。 不过，是被焚烧过后的清静峰。 竹林、竹舍，被焚毁殆尽，只有焦黑的残垣和枯根，歪斜倒塌，上有白烟混着糊味缕缕飘 散。 这荒凉凄惨的，沈清秋越看越是淡定不能。 烧太干净了，这得多大仇！ 沈清秋敲系统： “ 能报个地址吗？ ” 系统：【您好。惩罚程序运行中，系统其他功能不予正常开放，敬请谅解，祝您好运。】 wtf…… ！！！ 原来已经开始了！沈清秋捶了一下并不存在的墙，忽然，耳边传来踏碎沙石的脚步声。 这脚步声走一步，顿一步，缓慢而不拖沓，反倒给人一种蕴含劲力、蓄势待发的感觉。 一片焦土瓦砾之中，走来一道人影。 冷风穿原，那人黑袍宽袖微微浮动，脸和交叠的衣领一般的雪白无瑕，慢吞吞走出来，眼 睛像长在天上，一副目空一切的神情；抱着手臂，一脚踩在一块焦石上，一副兴味索然的 模样。 沈清秋下意识叫道： “ 洛冰河！ ” 洛冰河眨了眨眼，头部转了一个微小的角度，一道冰雪凝刃般的目光投射过来。 沈清秋被这目光一看，就像被钉了两刀子，心头突地一跳，忽然觉得风大，衣服有点薄。 不然为什么额头和背脊都凉飕飕的？ 洛冰河挑起一边的眉，弹了一下袖子上并不存在的焚灰，鼻子里发出一个略带疑惑的 “ 嗯？ ” 沈清秋猛地刹住脚步。 这个感觉，不对。 洛冰河歪了歪头： “ 沈清秋？ ” 越发不对。 这语气、神情、气质，不像是洛冰河，可也的确像是洛冰河。 一定要说清楚的话，站在沈清秋面前的，似乎是原著那个 “ 洛冰河 ” 。","CHAPTER 71: THE SYSTEM’S PENALTY The power he expended was controlled, just enough to cause a stalemate with Wu Wang. He even had time to look back and hastily say a few words to Luo Binghe: “Leave it to Master.” Wu Wang was about to continue mouthing some empty words, but he unexpectedly went straight to the point instead, scolding: “Shen Qingqiu, don’t be like Su Xiyanlosing her mind to the demon race in a moment of carelessness and regretting it for life. As a Peak Lord, you must at least have some sense of honor!” Shen Qingqiu’s feet slipped, and he almost failed to prevent himself from losing his bearings. How could these matters be the same? He managed to rearrange the distorted expression on his face with much difficulty. Who knew that Luo Binghe facing off against Wu Wang was a slap to the face? Shen Qingqiu poured spiritual energy into the tip of his fan, shaking off the attacker’s staff: “Didn’t I say to let me handle this?” Luo Binghe’s face was covered in gloom: “He can say things about me, but he’s not allowed to badmouth you!” In the time it took him to say these words, the two of them had already been surrounded by the cultivators from various sects who were present at the Hall of Great Strength. As expected, the demonic aura easily aroused hostility once it was used. Wu Wang waved his staff: “Lord Yue, this devil continues to call Shen Qingqiu master. Shen Qingqiu also does not deny it. What do you think? Do you also still recognize Luo Binghe as a disciple of the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect?” Yue Qingyuan did not answer. His face did not reveal any emotions, and his voice remained steady. He remained seated: “Shidi, come back.” Shen Qingqiu subconsciously stepped toward him, thinking that it would be better to own up to his mistakes and let his senior put out the fire. If Yue Qingyuan could stand on his side, it would definitely be a strategic location. But before he could come over, Luo Binghe grabbed him and entreated: “Don’t go!” He repeated himself: “Don’t go.” There was an imploring note to his words. Just as Shen Qingqiu was about to speak, hundreds of streams of sword energy rushed to surround and attack the two men. Liu Qingge’s eyes glared, and he drew Cheng Luan from its sheath in response. Suddenly, the whole of the Hall of Great Strength shook. A current ofblack and white electricity crisscrossed and expanded, and the encompassing light detonated. After the tremors passed, the ground still heaved and lurched, and only a quarter of the people present were left standing. Luo Binghe’s eyes were so red that they glowed in the daylight, as if they could leak hot magma or dark red blood. His clothes were wrapped in an endlessly churning dark aura. A member of the demon clan who had been pressed to the ground burst out laughing: “It seems it’s true that the cultivation world has no shame. When you dealt with Tianlang-Jun in the past, you used underhanded methods to surround and besiege him. You’re still using them today!” “Go ahead and use them. You don’t seem to fear death. Huh!” Luo Binghe held Shen Qingqiu against him with one arm and said: “I’m from the demon clan. You can attack me at will. But what did my shizun do to have you besiege him as well? Shen Qingqiu was actually unharmed. The tremors earlier had been quite strong. He’d stumbled, only to have Luo Binghe draw him into his arms to protect him. Wu Wang wanted to continue intervening, so he said: “You call him shizun. He doesn’t deny it. Isn’t that enough?” This stubborn ass! Shen Qingqiu flipped the fan in his hands until it flew up, and the swords that swept in to attack from all angles were continuously beaten back by the fan. He put on a fake smile and said: “Whether this Shen denies it or not, what does it have to do with you?” The sounds of clashing weapons were endless. Shen Qingqiu turned around. Suddenly, he saw Yue Qingyuan place his hand on Xuan Su’s hilt. With an imposing air, he drew closer until they came face to face. His hand went limp on the spot, and he almost hurled the fan away. Fight with Yue Qingyuan? Nonsense! Who would have expected that when Yue Qingyuan raised Xuan Su in his hand, it was not aimed at Shen Qingqiu at all? Instead, it was pointed several inches away. A loud noise rang in his ears, and Shen Qingqiu turned his head. Xuan Su’s hilt and Wu Wang’s staff blocked and circled each other head-to- head. Wu Wang couldn’t beat Luo Binghe, so he changed tactics and tried to hit him from behind instead! Although Yue Qingyuan had entered the melee, he did not attack the two targets who were at the heart of the battle. Instead, he idly assisted She Qingqiu and shielded him from attacks. Launching himself into the fray, Liu Qingge alsofollowed into battle. The two men struck indiscriminately, almost of the same mind. Hit anyone, as long as it wasn’t Shen Qingqiu. It was pure chaos. What was even worse was that the people wreaking havoc were two masters, and their attacks were both precise and ruthless. Wu Wang had finally reached the end of his patience, and he called angrily: “Peak Lord Liu!” With his sword, Liu Qingge whittled all the horsetail whisks of the Tianyi Monastery’s Taoists into bald stumps. “My hand slipped,” he said with a poker face. Wu Wang was angered until his beard curled: “Master Yue!” After Yue Qingyuan had deflected the staff that was aiming for Shen Qingqiu three times, Master Yue also said serenely: “My eyes are bad.” Everyone inside the hall silently agreed: The rumors about Cang Qiong Mountain Sect protecting its ownit’s definitely a well-deserved reputation!” One hand making a mistake could be explained, but how could both hands slip? One instance of mistaken identity is understandable. But acting willfully blind ever since you joined the battle, can this still be called a fair fight? Which side are you supposed to be standing on? (  □′) ┻━┻ You two are showing us with your actions: “Fighting is allowed. Fighting against the Qing Jing Peak’s Peak Lord is not!” Shen Qingqiu pushed Luo Binghe back: “Want to die? Go ahead!” Luo Binghe couldn’t be pushed aside. He caught him by the wrist instead, saying: “Shizun, let’s go. Follow me!” Shen Qingqiu didn’t turn around to look at his expression. First of all, he didn’t have the time for it. Second of all, he didn’t have enough patience to do so. He waved his hand, urging: “Still not moving! I’m telling you to go, so go! Listen to me 280 !” He didn’t know how long he could hold back the men surrounding them, so it was even more unlikely for him to abandon such a chaotic situation and run off with Luo Binghe first. Yue Qingyuan and Liu Qingge’s method of distraction was too obvious. Wu Wang was already enraged. Either him or Luo Bingheone of them should remain here, otherwise, a feud would arise between the Zhao Hua Temple and the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. After a moment of silence, Luo Binghe whispered: “Very well.” “Since it’s Shizun who says so.” The next moment, he landed on the square outside the Hall of Great Strength. His speed was so fast that it was terrifying. At that moment, peopleactually forgot to retrieve their swords and chase after them. Wu Wang screamed: “Surround them!” Several monks rushed to the square. Shen Qingqiu swiftly drew Xiu Ya in one smooth motion. He snapped a finger, and the sword ran amok, ruining their formation and messing up their steps. He shouted out: “Your master will return to Cang Qiong Mountain first. I’ll find you later.” Luo Binghe had the ability to enter the dreamscape. Any time he wanted to meet, there wouldn’t be any issues at all. Just nod your head and fall asleep, and when the time came, Shen Qingqiu can comfort his hurt feelings. But once these words were spoken out in public, Shen Qingqiu inevitably felt a bit guilty. He couldn’t resist sneaking a peek at the two men from the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. When he noticed this, the corners of Luo Binghe’s mouth lifted, revealing a strange smile. Quite a few people saw his smile and shivered, their hearts swallowed by irrational fear. Luo Binghe said slowly: “I will come back and get you.” Before his voice had even died away, he had already disappeared from the hall. Wu Wang let out a chagrined huff when he realized that he had gone missing. Shen Qingqiu breathed a sigh of relief and immediately summoned Xiu Ya back into its sheath. He unclasped his sword and held it horizontally, both hands extended in front of Yue Qingyuan in entreaty: “It was an emergency just now. Qingqiu had no choice but to act. I have offended you all. Please, allow my master and my martial brothers to pronounce their punishment on me.” Yue Qingyuan said “hmmm” and put away his sword: “Since you’ve already returned, let’s just discuss the matter of your punishment after we return to Cang Qiong Mountain.” Shen Qingqiu peeked at his face. Although Yue Qingyuan looked very serious, from his actions during the battle earlier… It should only be a front that he put on for outsiders. According to his past experiences, Yue Qingyuan’s “let’s just discuss after we return to Cang Qiong Mountain” was basically equivalent to “let’s just forget about this matter and go back home for dinner instead.” It was true that his own sect’s master was easygoing, but there was no way that Wu Wang would be so easily sent off. Luo Binghe had been allowed to escape in full view of everyone. Although the blame could mostly be laid on thethree peak lords who stirred up the waters, any way you looked at it, Zhao Hua Temple had also suffered a bit of embarrassment. He clapped his hands and said: “I’m afraid we can’t let it go just like this. Peak Lord Shen must at least give an accounting. Otherwise, Cang Qiong Mountain Sect must explain in his stead!” Someone shrieked from a corner: “Just now he said that Su Xiyan was being silly. It seems that a brother’s kindness cannot compare to one man’s flowery words. This Shen Qingqiu is even more silly. There’s no need to speak flowery words to Luo Binghe. He has no sense of what’s important at all.” Shen Qingqiu pretended not to have heard anything. Yue Qingyuan politely said: “I can discipline someone from the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect myself. Trust that I will give you all a proper accounting.” Abbot Wu Chen said agreeably: “Amitabha, that would be for the best. I believe that Master Yue and Peak Lord Shen will most definitely handle this matter both fairly and properly.” Wu Wang humped and continued his accusations: “That’s not necessarily true. Have you all forgotten how Peak Lord Shen promised to give an explanation about the sowers at Jinlan City? But actually, he hasn’t said anything about it to this day. He escaped not long after being imprisoned inside Huan Hua Palace’s water prison. Then he faked his own death and hid himself away at Hua Yue City for five years. Cang Qiong Mountain Sect hasn’t even given a detailed statement about this matter yet. If this is Peak Lord Shen’s “confession” to your sects, then this old monk really doesn’t dare compliment anyone.” He brought up old news again. But Shen Qingqiu’s mind had already wandered off, and he wasn’t listening at all. The system kept sending out red alerts ━ who still had the heart to listen to an old monk stir-frying cold rice and turning over old scores! System: “Zhao Hua Monastery” branching plot line cut off. Mission Stats: Reputation Value -200. Mission Accomplishment Status: Total Failure! He finally hit 200, but it wasn’t +200, it was -200! This would be the first time he’s failed a task in all the time he’s been dealing with the system. His brain was suddenly assailed with sensations of sharp pain and severe vertigo. System: Mission failed! May host please get ready. You will be sent back to your original world within 60 seconds. Any value below zero meant being sent back to one’s original world! Shen Qingqiu roared: “Quit fucking with me! This means being directlysent back to my original world? Don’t you know that my original account has already been canceled? It’s only one failure. My coolness value is so high, can’t I use that to offset a bit? How about B Points? My B Points are also very high! Such high values should be of some use, right?” His mind was spinning, and the color on his face kept changingfrom blue to white to red to green. He looked like he was about to vomit or faint at any time. Liu Qingge noticed that something was off with his expression and asked: “What’s wrong with you?” System: Do you want to use all your coolness points to buy a different penalty? Shen Qingqiu answered: “Buy, buy, buy! No matter how much it costs!” Ding! System: Purchase successful. Coolness points zeroed out. Please note your balance. Penalty is loading. The pink coolness points bar really turned into zero. This was his second time zeroing out. “Adios, wave bye-bye” The second time! Shen Qingqiu’s head no longer hurt, but he still felt dizzy. Yue Qingyuan also noticed that something was wrong with him: “Were you hit earlier?” Liu Qingge supported Shen Qingqiu with one hand and until he had steadied himself. Looking up, Liu Qingge asked: “Who did it?” Bai Zhan Peak’s Peak Lord asked a question, and everyone hurriedly shook their heads in succession. Was he joking? Who could manage to land a blow on Shen Qingqiu? Considering the scenario earlier, even if someone had managed to hit Shen Qingqiu, it probably wouldn’t have landed cleanly anyway. Who was it that the three masters had been secretly protecting earlier? Yet he still had the nerve to sling accusations when it was obviously only him who had the opportunity to beat up others! The sounds of arguments coming from outside were getting louder and louder. Shen Qingqiu was woozy, and his eyes were going dark. He was wedged between Yue Qingyuan and Liu Qingge when a loud boom sounded. Looks like he made the wrong decision. When he opened his eyes again, he was no longer at Zhao Hua Temple. Shen Qingqiu looked in all directions, but there wasn’t a single soul to be found. It looked like he was inside a dream. But if that was the case, and he was dreaming right now, then the location should be Qing Jing Peak. Because his dreamscape and Luo Binghe’s were connected, and the latter’s favorite dreaming location was Qing Jing Peak.Shen Qingqiu walked around aimlessly for a while. After careful observation, he eventually confirmed that this place was indeed Qing Jing Peak. However, it was Qing Jing Peak after it burned down. The bamboo grove and bamboo house had been burned to the ground. Only blackened ruins and withered roots remained. Everything had collapsed helter-skelter, as wisps of white smoke carrying a burnt smell drifted away. The more Shen Qingqiu saw this desolate and miserable scene, the more uncertain he became. The burning was done too thoroughly. Such terrible vengeance! Shen Qingqiu alerted the system: “Can you report our location?” System: Greetings. While the penalty is in progress, the system’s other functions cannot be accessed. Hoping for your understanding and wishing you the best of luck. So the penalty had already begun. Shen Qingqiu thumped on a nonexistent wall. Suddenly, the sound of footsteps on gravel reached his ears. The steps sounded outwalk a pace, stop a pace, slow but not sluggish. They gave off a feeling of strength and readiness. A figure appeared in the middle of the expanse of scorched earth and rubble. The man’s black robes and wide sleeves fluttered gently as the cold wind swept by. His face and his collar were the same flawless and snowy white. His arms were crossed as he slowly walked closer. There was a supercilious expression on his face, and from time to time he would kick away the charred gravel at his feet with a disinterested look. Shen Qingqiu unconsciously cried out: “Luo Binghe!” Luo Binghe blinked. Head turned at a slight angle, he shot a frosty, piercing gaze in his direction. For Shen Qingqiu, being speared by such a gaze was like being nailed in place by two knives. His heart jumped. All of a sudden, he felt that the wind was too strong, and his clothes were too thin. Otherwise, why would his brow and his spine both feel a chill? Luo Binghe raised a brow. He flicked some nonexistent ash off his sleeve and breathed a slightly doubtful “hmmm” through his nose. Shen Qingqiu stopped in his tracks. This feeling, it’s wrong. Luo Binghe cocked his head: “Shen Qingqiu?” Even more wrong."
"沈清秋僵立在原地 ,“ 洛冰河 ” 见他不答，朝这边走出了一步。 沈清秋下意识想握剑防身，可腰间手间空空如也。 他嚷： “ 系统！惩罚程序究竟是个什么玩意儿？！你是让我赤手空拳打 boss 吗？！ ” 系统：【您好 , 惩罚程序运行期间，系统一切其它功能不予开放 , 包括咨询。谢谢理解。祝 您好运。】 我屮！ 这个状况完全不知道该干点什么啊！ 洛冰河双手拢在袖子里 , 莞尔道： “ 沈清秋，你怎么在这儿？ ” 好吧，沈清秋能确定了，面前的 , 绝逼不是这个世界的洛冰河！ 洛冰河对他都是师尊前、师尊后 , 叫得蜜里调油 , 根本不敢这样直呼名字，更不会用这么随 便的口气。 反正是惩罚程序 , 应该死不了。这么一想 , 沈清秋稍微放松了点。 他镇定道： “ 这里是清静峰。 ” 洛冰河看了看四周： “ 你不说，我还想不起来了。 ” 为什么想不起来！ 如果这个真是原著的洛冰河，清静峰不正是他一把火烧成这样的吗！ 沈清秋道： “ 你又为什么会在这里？ ” 洛冰河耸肩： “ 不清楚。 ” 然后，他对着沈清秋露出一种诡异的笑容。 这种笑容，就像是他养了一条狗，有一天忽然发现这条狗会说人话。沈清秋被他看得毛骨 悚然。 洛冰河道： “ 你不怕我了？ ” 外面那个，不怕。里面这个，怕！！！ 洛冰河对他举起一只手： “ 过来。 ” 如果是原装货，被黑化后的洛冰河这么一招手，绝对就怕得要死乖乖过去了，沈清秋才不 想这么傻逼。 刚一转身，那道黑色的身影就出现在他面前，挡住了去路，只差不到几寸便要撞上。沈清 秋猛地撤步后退，险些仰面栽倒。洛冰河伸出两指，扯了下他的衣袖，把他拉了回来，温 和地说： “ 跑什么呢？ ” 现在再看这张脸，沈清秋总感觉情绪复杂，已经不能像以前那样简单无谓地面对了。 打也打不下去，怕也怕不彻底。五味陈杂。 他还不死心，狂敲系统： “ 这个真是原著的洛冰河吧？！不是这个世界的洛冰河吧？！我 该怎么做才能通过惩罚？难道是要打赢他？坑我呢？！ ” 系统：【您好，惩罚程序运行期间 …… 】 沈清秋叉掉了对话框。 洛冰河盯着他的脸看了半晌，皱眉道： “ 你好像有哪里不太一样。你真是沈清秋？ ” 沈清秋眨了眨眼，心中燃起一丝希望。洛冰河凝视着他的脸，似乎略感困惑，慢慢握住了 他的右手。 他的手掌一如既往，干燥又冰凉，沈清秋心中微动，刚想说点什么，忽然，右肩一凉。 那一瞬间，沈清秋并没有右手臂从肩膀脱离的感觉，只是看着一条东西飞了出去，半边身 子变轻了，还迷迷茫茫的，没反应过来。 直到毁天灭地的剧痛猛地蹿过他全身和大脑。 洛冰河生生把他的右手臂扯了下来！ 受到巨创，沈清秋的躯体自发反弹出一波灵力，被洛冰河拍了一掌，立即溃不成军。 喷涌的鲜血完全止不住，沈清秋头昏眼花，可能听到有人在惨叫，也可能没听到，耳鸣太 尖锐，他不清楚，只想着赶快从眼前这个人面前逃开！ 他踉跄着倒退，没退几步，绊到地上的焦竹残根，整个人仰面倒了下去。 断臂的疼痛太惨烈，以至于后脑摔地的感觉都被忽略了。洛冰河从容地随了上来，这次， 轻轻抚上了他的一只小腿。 人棍！ 洛冰河现在是打算把他做成人棍！ 沈清秋疼得呼吸都困难，用剩下那只手臂抓住他，胡乱摇头，上气不接下气道： “ 别 …… 别……” 别用这张脸做这种事。 洛冰河单手把沈清秋牢牢按在地上，目光几乎可以说是款款深情。 他柔声道： “ 师尊可千万不要再拒绝我了。 ” 刹那间，一阵撕心裂肺的剧痛从左腿根部迅速蔓延遍布全身。 沈清秋忍无可忍，厉声惨叫起来！ 突然，那阵疼痛陡然消失，沈清秋从地面上弹起。 系统平板的语音发来提示：【惩罚结束。】 惩罚？ 呵呵。 系统你妈炸了！！！ 沈清秋连吐槽和呼系统巴掌的心情都没有，跪在地上，看着冷汗一滴一滴坠上地面，好半 天都没有已经逃离出来的实感。 一旁有个声音忽然道： “ 你怎么回事？ ” 他这才注意到，这里不止他一个人。 而且，他似乎还没被拉回现实世界，这里仍是梦境。而且这个山洞有点眼熟。 当年第一次入梦时，梦魔呈黑雾状态潜伏的那个山洞。 旁边那人，正是梦魔。 沈清秋勉强定住心神： “ 我怎么在这里？ ” 梦魔道： “ 你进入了一个极其强势的梦境，元神剧震，老夫见似乎不妙，便把你拉入了这 边的结界。 ” 这么说，他没被完全削成人棍，还要感谢梦魔及时把他拉了出来。 印象中，梦魔应该不怎么待见他，居然会见势不好，把他拉出来，沈清秋略感意外，由衷 地道： “ 多谢。帮大忙了。 ” 梦魔哼道： “ 不必言谢。老夫不过惊讶，上次你居然真的能在圣陵坚持到那小子醒来。你 也算是帮了他不少。帮他，便是帮老夫。 ” 洛冰河。 一想到这个名字，沈清秋忍不住左手抱住右边肩膀。 那种生生被撕下一条手臂的剧痛已经深深烙印在他神经上，随时会被触发。 他吸了几口气，这才能声音不发颤地叫出那三个字的名字： “ 怎么没见洛冰河？ ” 照理说，最积极、最喜欢拉他入梦的应该是洛冰河。基本上沈清秋一睡着，他就过来骚扰 （…… ）。而这次，居然被梦魔抢先，把沈清秋拉进了结界中。 梦魔想起来就郁闷： “ 老夫怎知道？这小子自从掌控了我的梦魇奇术，我就再也进不去他 的梦境了。天底下只有他一人所思所梦，老夫分毫奈何不了。 ” 如果不能尽快见到那个乖巧的洛冰河，沈清秋觉得自己要发疯，会一直想到这个名字就四 肢疼，一直胡思乱想下去。 麻烦纯情少男小白花赶快出来给他吃一颗定心丸！ 梦魔斜眼瞥他，见沈清秋脸色发青，嘴唇发白，板着脸道： “ 那小子自会来找你的，你急 什么？之前不是避之不及？ ” 这算是 …… 安慰吗？ 沈清秋看着故作不屑状的梦魔，忽然觉得这老头儿有点可爱。 顿了顿，他忽然想起一事： “ 梦魔前辈，之前在圣陵，我带洛冰河往东走，途中遇到两个 人，其中有个女子，你有没有 ……” 那时，秋海棠昏迷了一阵，醒来时便无端发疯，落荒而逃。沈清秋极度怀疑，在那失去意 识的那会儿，她在梦境中遭遇了什么。 当时洛冰河也昏迷着，脑子烧得像炭火，当然无暇侵入秋海棠的梦境。那么，最大的可能 ，就是梦魔在其中动了手脚。 果然，梦魔一捻胡须，道： “ 正是老夫略施小计。 ” 他虽然说的是 “ 略施小计 ” ，故作淡然，却掩不住语气中自傲之意。沈清秋忍不住问： “ 你 究竟给她看了什么？ ” 一般而言，梦魔要击溃一个人的心理，就是给她看自己最灰暗痛苦的记忆。难道梦魔把秋 氏被灭门的记忆翻出来了？ 也不对。 如果是这样，那么秋海棠醒来之后第一眼看到沈清秋，不应该是那种反应，而应该是恨意 滔天、一剑刺过来、往他身上戳几百个窟窿才对。为什么会又哭又叫，转身就跑？ 梦魔道： “ 我给她看的，不是她的记忆，是你的记忆。 ” 沈清秋秒懂。 是残留在他身体里的一点沈九的记忆！ 他对向天打飞机之前提到的关于沈清秋原设没写出来的部分一直非常在意，立刻说： “ 能 请前辈调出来，给我看看吗？ ” 梦魔看他一眼，并没问他自己的记忆为什么要别人调给他看，只问： “ 你是不记得了？ ” 沈清秋正准备扯什么走火入魔记忆受损来搪塞，点头： “ 不错。 ” 要知道，走火入魔记忆受损什么的，这概率也是相当之低。梦魔居然也没追问怀疑，却道 ：“ 有些事情，不记得也好。 ” 别这样吊人胃口行不行！！！ 沈清秋道： “ 恳请前辈相助。 ” 梦魔道： “ 你真的要看？ ” 沈清秋连连点头。梦魔伸出一指，点于他额头之上： “ 闭眼，等我松手，再睁眼。 ” 沈清秋依言闭目。梦魔又道： “ 你记忆残缺不全，跳跃而不连贯，也可能会见到面目模糊 的人像。这是你自身所致，不必在意。 ” 这意思，其实是在强调，如果出了 bug ，那是你自身源文件的问题，不是他技术的问题！ 沈清秋心中默数十声，等到额头压力消失，一睁开眼睛，一个身形单薄的少年披头散发， 被麻绳五花大绑着，跪坐在他前面的地上。 这少年白脸尖下巴，眉清目秀，面相却带一股挥之不去的阴郁，嘴角额头两块於紫。正是 年纪尚幼的沈九。 在花月城的时候，沈清秋从洛冰河的梦境结界中逃出，无意间落入了沈九的残识记忆中， 见到的就是这幅场景。 一番环视，他发现，这是间书房和卧室连在一起的宽敞屋子，中间用檀木月洞门隔开，陈 设富丽，四壁挂着裱装精美的字画。 沈清秋抱起手臂，靠在一旁多宝格的架子上，静静地等着。 前方的雕花木门无声无息打开。 沈九头僵定不动，眼珠上转，来人身形的倒影被映入瞳孔之中。 迈入门槛的，是个衣饰华贵的青年男子。 看他那张和秋海棠五官有六分相似的脸庞，沈清秋便知道，这必然是秋氏灭门事件最大的 苦主，秋海棠她哥哥了。 那时沈九眼里的人影，居然是秋少爷，这可出乎意料，沈九看上去根被虐待多年似的，沈 清秋本来还以为那人影是人贩子。 看这情况，沈九在秋家里的日子，怎么也不像秋海棠所说的 “ 待他亲厚非常 ” 。","That tone, that expression, that temperament. They were not like Luo Binghe, but they were indeed also like Luo Binghe. What needed to be clarified was that the one who stood in front of Shen Qingqiu… seemed to be the “Luo Binghe” from the original novel. Shen Qingqiu froze in place. When “Luo Binghe” saw that he didn’t answer, he took a step towards his side. Shen Qingqiu subconsciously sought to wield a sword in defense, but both his waistband and his hands were empty. He knocked at the system: “System, what the hell kind of joke is this penalty supposed to be? Where did you even drag this out from? Are you asking me to fight the BOSS with my bare hands?” System: Greetings. While the penalty is in progress, the system’s other functions cannot be accessed, including consultation. Hoping for your understanding and wishing you the best of luck. Fuck, fuck, fuck! He had no idea what to do in this kind of situation! Luo Binghe tucked his hands inside his sleeves and smiled as he remarked: “Shen Qingqiu, why are you here? I don’t seem to remember letting you in?” Shen Qingqiu was 10,000% certain that the man in front of him was definitely not this world’s Luo Binghe. Luo Binghe treated his shizun as the beginning and end of his world, always addressing him in the sweetest and most affectionate manner. He would never dare to call him by name so directly, let alone use such a provocative tone of voice with him. Anyway, this was just part of the penalty procedure. He probably wouldn’t die. Thinking like this, Shen Qingqiu relaxed a little and calmly mentioned: “This is Qing Jing Peak.” Luo Binghe looked around: “If you hadn’t said so, I never would have thought it.” How could he not remember? If this really was the original Luo Binghe, then wasn’t it him who set fire to Qing Jing Peak?CHAPTER 72: THE PERSON NAMED SHEN JIU Luo Binghe said, “You’re not afraid of me anymore?” Not of the one outside. But the one in here, yes! Luo Binghe raised a hand towards him. “Come here.” If this was the original Luo Binghe after being blackened, no matter how he beckoned him, Shen Qingqiu definitely would have been so afraid that he would’ve just obediently gone over. But Shen Qingqiu still had the courage to fight to the death. However, the moment he turned around, that black-robed figure appeared in front of him, blocking his path. Shen Qingqiu was only a scant few inches away from knocking into him. Shen Qingqiu violently backpedaled and narrowly avoided tripping. Luo Binghe reached out two fingers, tugging on his sleeve and pulling him back. He said gently, “Why are you running?” Facing this face, right now Shen Qingqiu couldn’t even hit him, nor could he be completely afraid of him. He still didn’t give up and continued to knock on the System. “This is really the original Luo Binghe, right? It’s not this world’s Luo Binghe? What should I do to get through the punishment? Do I have to beat him? This isn’t much different from you just sending me back to my original world, is it!” The System: Hello, while the punishment program is running… Shen Qingqiu closed the dialogue box. Luo Binghe stared at his face for a while before he frowned and said, “I keep feeling as if… it seems like there’s something different about you. You’re really Shen Qingqiu?” Shen Qingqiu blinked, maintaining his vigilance. Luo Binghe gazed at his face, looking a little perplexed before he slowly reached out and held Shen Qingqiu’s right hand. His palm was the same as always: dry yet ice-cold. Shen Qingqiu’s heart was slightly moved, and he was about to say something when his right shoulder suddenly went cold. In that instant, Shen Qingqiu didn’t actually feel the sensation of his right arm leaving his shoulder. He only saw something fly away as half of his body grew light before he had time to react. Up until a monstrous, enormous pain suddenly washed through his entire body and brain. Luo Binghe just completely ripped off his right arm!Upon receiving the heavy injury, Shen Qingqiu’s body backlashed with a wave of spiritual energy all on its own. Luo Binghe struck him, and the energy immediately broke and scattered. There was no way to stop the blood gushing out. Shen Qingqiu’s vision blurred, and he might have heard someone screaming, but he also might not have. His ears were ringing too sharply, and he couldn’t understand. He only wanted to quickly escape from this person in front of him! He stumbled backward. After just a few steps, he tripped over the remnants of some charred bamboo, and he toppled, face-up, onto the ground. The pain from losing an arm was too terrible, to the point that it even overwhelmed the feeling of his head smashing onto the ground. Luo Binghe calmly followed him. This time, he lightly stroked one of Shen Qingqiu’s calves. Human stick! Right now, Luo Binghe was planning on making him into a human stick! It hurt so much that it was hard to breathe. Shen Qingqiu used his remaining arm to grab onto Luo Binghe, shaking his head wildly as he gasped for air. “Don’t… don’t…” Don’t use that face to do something like this. Luo Binghe used one hand to firmly restrain Shen Qingqiu on the ground. His gaze could nearly be described as sincere and affectionate. He said gently, “It’s not as if this is my first time doing something like this. How is Shizun still so unaccustomed to it? Then, let’s do it a few more times until you slowly get used to it. How about that?” In a heartbeat, a gut-wrenching agony spread rapidly from the base of his left leg throughout his entire body. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t bear it any longer, and he let out a bloodcurdling scream! Suddenly, the System’s monotonous voice issued a notice: The punishment has finished. The pain abruptly vanished, and Shen Qingqiu violently turned over and stood up before immediately collapsing onto his knees again. He didn’t even have the energy to curse the System and slap it in the face as he half-knelt on the ground, watching his drops of cold sweat land in bursts, dazed. A voice suddenly spoke from the side. “What happened to you?” Only then did he notice that he wasn’t the only one here. In addition, it seemed as if he hadn’t been pulled back to reality yet. This was still the dreamscape.This cave also seemed a little familiar. It looked like the same cave that the Dream Demon hid in when he appeared as a black mist that first time Shen Qingqiu entered the dream all those years ago. The one next to him was precisely the Dream Demon. Shen Qingqiu forcefully calmed himself down and asked in reply, “Why am I here at your place?” The Dream Demon said, “You entered an extremely powerful dreamscape, and it seemed like your primordial spirit was in danger of ripping apart. I wanted to intervene the entire time, but I couldn’t. I tried many times before I suddenly succeeded just then, and along the way, I pulled you into the formation over here.” Before, he had the impression that the Dream Demon didn’t really like him, but unexpectedly, when the Dream Demon saw that the situation wasn’t good, he ended up pulling Shen Qingqiu out “along the way.” Shen Qingqiu felt slightly surprised, and he said sincerely, “Many thanks, Elder… you’ve helped me greatly.” The Dream Demon snorted. “No need to thank me. I’m just astonished that last time in the Holy Mausoleum, you actually managed to hang on until that brat woke up. You helped him quite a bit too. Helping him means helping this old man.” That kind of agony from having an arm completely ripped off was already deeply embedded into Shen Qingqiu’s mind, and it was triggered any time that face floated up in his brain. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but grip his right shoulder with his left hand. He had to take in several breaths of air before he could say that name without his voice trembling. “Why don’t I see Luo Binghe?” Usually, the one who tried the hardest and liked pulling him into dreams the most should be Luo Binghe. Basically every time Shen Qingqiu fell asleep, Luo Binghe would come over to disturb him. But this time, the Dream Demon actually beat Luo Binghe to it and pulled Shen Qingqiu into the formation first. The Dream Demon grew depressed just thinking about it. “How would I know? Ever since the brat learned how to control my nightmare technique, I couldn’t enter his dreamscape ever again. In this world, only he dreams what he wishes to. I can’t do anything about it.” If Shen Qingqiu couldn’t see the adorable Luo Binghe as fast as possible, he felt as if his limbs would continue to hurt the instant he recalled that name. Could the young man who was a pure and innocent little white flower quickly come out and feed him a tranquilizer?The Dream Demon shot a glance at him. When he saw that Shen Qingqiu’s expression was ashen, his lips pale, the Dream Demon’s face grew serious. “That brat will come to find you on his own Why are you worrying? Before, weren’t you doing your best to avoid him?” Could this count as consolation? As Shen Qingqiu looked at the Dream Demon, who was feigning disdain, he suddenly felt that this old man was a little cute. He relaxed and sat on the ground. After a pause, Shen Qingqiu suddenly remembered something. “Elder Dream Demon, when I was in the Holy Mausoleum before, I carried Luo Binghe east. On the way there, I met two people. One of them was a woman. Did you…” Back then, Qiu Haitang had lost consciousness for a little. When she woke, she went crazy for no reason at all and ran away. Shen Qingqiu suspected greatly that when she was unconscious, she encountered something in the dreamscape. At that time, Luo Binghe was also unconscious, his head burning like coal, so of course, he didn’t have time to invade Qiu Haitang’s dreamscape. In that case, the most likely possibility was that the Dream Demon did something. As expected, the Dream Demon twirled his beard and said, “Just a little trick I did, that’s all.” Even though he called it “a little trick” and pretend to be indifferent, he couldn’t conceal the arrogant tone to his voice. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t resist asking, “What exactly did you show her?” Generally speaking, if the Dream Demon wanted to destroy somebody’s mind, he would show her her own darkest and most painful memories. Could it be that the Dream Demon pulled out her memories of the Qiu clan being wiped out? No, that wasn’t right either. If that was the case, Qiu Haitang shouldn’t have reacted the way she had the moment she opened her eyes and saw Shen Qingqiu. She should’ve overflowed with hatred and struck out with her sword instead, trying to stab several hundred holes in him. Why would she cry and scream before turning and running? The Dream Demon: “What I showed her wasn’t her memories. It was yours.” Shen Qingqiu understood instantly. It was the bits and pieces of Shen Jiu’s memories that were still remaining in his body! He had always cared a lot about what Airplane Shooting Towards the Skymentioned before, concerning the portion of the original Shen Qingqiu that he hadn’t written down. Shen Qingqiu immediately said, “Could Elder please pull it out and show it to me?” The Dream Demon looked at him, but he didn’t ask why Shen Qingqiu wanted someone else to pull out his own memories for him to see. He only asked, “You don’t remember them anymore?” Shen Qingqiu prepared to toss out some excuse about how his memories were damaged when he had a qi deviation in order to avoid the question. He nodded. “Correct.” It had to be said that the probability of having one’s memories damaged from qi deviation was still fairly low. But the Dream Demon didn’t actually pursue the topic. Instead, he said, “It’s better not to remember some things.” Shen Qingqiu said, “I earnestly request Elder’s help.” The Dream Demon: “You really want to see it?” Shen Qingqiu nodded his head. The Dream Demon reached out a finger and pressed it against Shen Qingqiu’s forehead. “Close your eyes. Open them only when I let go.” Shen Qingqiu obeyed and closed his eyes. The Dream Demon spoke again. “Your memories are badly damaged and are not complete. They skip over parts and aren’t continuous. You might also see people whose faces are blurry. This is caused by your own body. There’s no need to pay attention to it.” What he meant to say was that if there was a BUG, it was a problem with your body’s source file, not my technique. Shen Qingqiu counted to ten in his mind, and when the pressure against his forehead disappeared, he opened his eyes. A thin young man with disheveled hair was kneeling on the ground in front of him, his upper body bound by hemp rope 281 . This young man’s face was pale, his chin sharp and his features pretty. But his face carried an irremovable sense of gloominess, and there were purple sections at the corners of his mouth and forehead. It was Shen Jiu when he was still young. At Huayue City, when Shen Qingqiu escaped from Luo Binghe’s dreamscape formation, he inadvertently landed in the remnants of Shen Jiu’s memories. What he saw was precisely this scene. With a glance around, he discovered that, sure enough, what he saw during his hasty glimpse back then wasn’t wrong. This was a spacious room with a library and a bedroom linked together, separated only by a hardwood moon gate door. It was furnishedlavishly, and exquisite calligraphy and paintings hung on the walls. It was impossible for a family that wasn’t rich to obtain these so this couldn’t be the lair of some human traffickers 282 . Shen Qingqiu crossed his arms and leaned against a nearby shelf that had many treasure slots on it, waiting quietly. The wooden door carved with flowers and plants in front of him opened soundlessly. Shen Jiu’s head remained rigid and he didn’t move, but his eyes swept upwards as the newcomer’s figure reflected in his irises. A young man with luxurious clothing stepped over the threshold. When Shen Qingqiu saw that face of his, which looked 60% like Qiu Haitang’s, he knew that this had to be the eldest member from the Qiu clan extermination: Qiu Haitang’s older brother. What he had suspected before was correct. No matter what, the days that Shen Jiu spent in the Qiu family wasn’t like what Qiu Haitang said, nor had he been “treated like family.” The youth strolled leisurely over to Shen Jiu and circled half around him. Shen Jiu’s face was tightly drawn, his lips pressed together. Even though his expression was dark, his shoulders trembled slightly. He was clearly extremely afraid, but he was forcing himself to remain calm. Suddenly, Young Master Qiu kicked him square in the back. Shen Jiu immediately sprawled onto the ground face-first. Young Master Qiu chuckled coldly. “What, you don’t dare to hit back this time?” Shen Jiu landed with a nose full of blood and dust. He said lowly, “Spare me, Young Master. I didn’t know that was you.” Young Master Qiu said, “You didn’t know? You didn’t know, and you still dared to provoke me!” He slapped Shen Jiu onto the ground with one hand, and Shen Jiu’s head made a muffled noise when it slammed against the floor as two streams of blood flowed down his chin. Young Master Qiu seemed to derive immense pleasure from doing this, and he took great joy in slapping him like playing with a ball. Shen Qingqiu continued to watch from the side, maintaining his silence. This happened over a dozen times before Shen Jiu finally couldn’t bear it any longer and he shouted, “What exactly do you want to do?” Young Master Qiu laughed maliciously. “You belong to our family now. Naturally, I can do whatever I want.”Suddenly, a gentle and beautiful voice belonging to a young woman sounded from outside the door. “Brother? Brother? Are you inside?” The moment Young Master Qiu heard his little sister calling for him, his expression changed, and he unbound Shen Jiu before he threatened him softly, “Wipe your face! If you dare to say anything wrong, I’ll kill you!” Shen Jiu was both afraid and resentful. A fierce glint flashed through his eyes, but he didn’t dare to say anything despite his rage. He viciously wiped his face, rubbing away the dust and the blood from his nose, but the more he wiped, the dirtier it became. When Young Master Qiu saw this, he picked up a flower vase from the window and splashed the water inside onto Shen Jiu’s face. Young Master Qiu changed his expression before opening the door, beaming. “Why did Tang-er come over?” Shen Qingqiu finally knew how the original Shen Qingqiu’s ‘fawning on the surface but spiteful behind people’s backs’ character developed. It was most likely acquired and influenced by Young Master Qiu… Qiu Haitang wore an embroidered lilac robe and a pair of small white satin boots. The tips were embellished with jewels, and she was truly a delicate young mistress born from a flower bud. It was a different kind of beauty compared to her later allure, which was tempered through hardship. She stepped in through the door and giggled. “I heard that brother bought somebody, and I came over to take a look.” She saw a teenager shrunk in the corner, his head hanging low. But his face was quite delicate and pretty, and her eyes lit up. She walked over before she said, all smiles, “You’re Xiao Jiu 283 , then?” Shen Jiu’s face was already wiped clean, but he still looked quite unhappy, and he didn’t answer her. Young Master Qiu stood behind his sister, his eyes threatening. He laughed and said, “He doesn’t really like to speak. His personality is quite strange.” Qiu Haitang took Shen Jiu’s hand and said, “Why don’t you like to speak? Talk to me a little, please?” Her voice was soft and coaxing, her tone intimate, her attitude innocent and pure. Nobody could have the heart to embarrass her. Shen Qingqiu thought, When Qiu Haitang was a young woman, she was truly a bit similar to Ning Yingying. It turned out that the original Shen Qingqiu had always liked this type. At first, Shen Jiu’s face was stiff, but he still couldn’t hold out against a young maiden’s gentle cajoling. His expression was one of silent enduring, and he turned his head, his ears slightly red. When Qiu Haitang saw this, she clappedand said, “Brother, he’s so much fun. No wonder you bought him even though you never liked to bring in people from outside. I kind of like him.” Young Master Qiu smiled fakely. “I also quite like him.” When Shen Jiu heard the word “like,” he couldn’t help but shudder. At this point in the memories, the entire scene suddenly darkened. The people present all swiftly vanished. Shen Qingqiu started before he immediately understood that the Dream Demon’s so-called ‘rupture’ had occurred. Since the memories that the original Shen Qingqiu left in his body weren’t complete, the ruptures would happen extremely frequently. The previous memory had already ended, and now another one began. The scene was still set in that room. This time, Shen Jiu wasn’t bound, and he was lying on the ground with a swollen face as he picked viciously at the woolen rug on the floor to the point that his fingers were bloodstained. Abruptly, two light knocks came from the door. A young man’s lowered voice came from outside. “Xiao Jiu, Xiao Jiu?” The moment Shen Jiu heard this voice, he suddenly moved and threw himself against the door. He pressed his face against the lock and said, “Qi Ge 284 !” The young man outside said, “Quiet down, I snuck inside.” At first, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t tell who the person outside was. When he thought about it again, he realized that the reason Shen Jiu had the character for “nine” in his name was because he was ranked ninth in the hands of the human traffickers. Naturally, there would be a ‘one through eight’ as well. However, Shen Qingqiu was truly a little astonished that Shen Jiu actually had a good friend with his kind of personality. Rattling noises came from the door as if the person outside was shaking it. Shen Jiu said, “It’s useless. There are five or six locks on the inside and outside. The window is also locked.” The youth said worriedly, “They didn’t do anything much to you this time when the escape didn’t succeed, did they?” Shen Jiu’s temper suddenly surged up, and he cursed, “They didn’t do anything much to me? Are you stupid? They’ve locked me in here for two days already and broke both my legs. What do you think?” In reality, Shen Qingqiu could see clearly that though Shen Jiu had suffered a beating and he couldn’t walk, both of his legs were still fine. They were hardly broken. But the young man couldn’t see the circumstances on the other side of the door, and he seemed to believe Shen Jiu. He said with guilt,“It’s all my fault.” Shen Jiu said angrily, “Of course it’s all your fault! I blame you. We weren’t close with those newcomers, so what if we were stepped on a little? Why did you have to play hero! Are you afraid that people like us with such lowly lives can’t bear it? If you hadn’t played hero, why would I have helped you? If I hadn’t helped you, how would I have provoked him, and how would that Qiu guy have ended up buying me? If he hadn’t bought me, how would I have become like this? Every two days I get beat up a little bit and every three days I get beat up a lot ━ he plays me like I’m a dog!” The young man repeated, “I’m sorry, it’s all my fault.” Sure enough, with Shen Jiu’s personality, if he had friends, they definitely had to have incredibly good tempers. After several continuous apologies, Shen Jiu finally forcefully dispelled his anger and said, “Whatever! I’ve never valued that damn thing called loyalty. I’ll give all my loyalty for this life to you.” The young man said gratefully, “I know.” Shen Jiu said viciously, “What the hell do you know.” The youth said, “I really know. Seventh Bro will remember your loyalty. I will definitely repay it to you in the future.” Shen Jiu spat, “What future! For people like you who are in the possession of human traffickers for your entire life, in the future, your fate will also be to become a human trafficker. No, you’re a good person, so you can’t be a human trafficker. At the most, you’ll just continue to beg for food.” The youth said, “Xiao Jiu, I came to talk to you about that. I’m going to leave. I came today to say goodbye to you.” Shen Jiu was startled, and he immediately sat up. “Leave? Where are you going?” The young man called Seventh Bro said, “I can’t stay here anymore. The Qiu family has a lot of influence and wealth in the city. We can’t possibly beat them, nor can we escape from them. There are so many cultivating sects in this world. I’m going to join one and learn how to cultivate so I can come back and rescue you.” Shen Jiu’s eyes suddenly lit up with a brilliant radiance. “Seventh Bro, I heard there’s an immortal mountain to the east that recruits disciples who are exceptionally talented each year. Are you going there?” The youth answered, “I don’t know… but I’ll go give them all a try. There has to be one sect that will take me?” Shen Jiu murmured, “If I weren’t locked in here, I could also go with"
"那青年慢悠悠踱到沈九身边，绕着他转了半圈。 沈九紧绷着脸，抿着嘴唇。虽然阴沉沉的 , 肩膀却在微微发抖，明明十分害怕 , 却强作镇 定。 忽然 , 秋少爷踹了一脚，正踹在他背上。沈九顿时脸扑上地。 秋少爷冷笑道： “ 怎么，这次不敢打回来了？ ” 沈九碰了一鼻子灰和血 , 低声道： “ 少爷饶命。我不知道那是您。 ” 秋少爷道： “ 不知道？不知道你也敢惹我！ ” 他一巴掌把沈九拍到地上，后者脑门咚的撞出闷响，两道鼻血顺着下巴流。秋少爷像是从 中得到了莫大的乐趣 , 拍皮球一样玩儿得不亦乐乎。 沈清秋： …… 这人是有 s 喜好吧？变态的人的变态的魔，真是各有各的酸爽！ 如此来回数十次，沈九终于忍不住，大叫道： “ 你究竟想怎么样？！ ” 秋少爷笑得恶毒： “ 你现在是我们家的人了 , 自然是我想怎么样就怎么样！ ” 忽然，门外响起一个柔美的少女声： “ 哥哥？哥哥？你在里面吗？ ” 秋少爷一听妹妹叫唤，脸色一变，把沈九身上绳子解开，低声威胁道： “ 把你脸抹抹！敢 说错一句话，要你的命！ ” 沈九又恨又怕，眼睛里凶光闪动，敢怒不敢言，恶狠狠在脸上抹了两把，擦去鼻血和灰 土。秋少爷已换了一副表情，打开门，笑的满面春风： “ 棠儿怎么过来了？ ” 沈清秋总算是知道原装货那种当面奉承背地阴人的性格是怎么形成的了，多半是在秋少爷 身边耳濡目染养成的 …… 秋海棠身穿淡紫色锦衣，脚上一双白缎小蛮靴，迈进门来，嘻嘻道： “ 我听说哥哥买了个 人，过来看看是什么样的。 ” 她见角落里站着一个少年，低头耷脑，缩手缩脚，脸蛋却清秀得很，眼睛一亮，走过去， 笑盈盈地道： “ 你就是小九了？ ” 沈九闷头闷脑，一句不答。秋少爷站在其妹身后，目露威胁之色，笑道： “ 他不怎么爱说 话，脾气古怪的紧。 ” 秋海棠牵起他的手，道： “ 你为什么不爱说话呢？跟我说一说，好不好？ ” 她声音娇柔，语气亲近，又是一副天真烂漫之态，任是谁也不忍心给不好的脸色。沈九原 本板着脸，却也扛不住一个小姑娘这样软磨，神色松了松，转过头去。 看到这里，沈清秋多少有点想法了。少女时期的秋海棠，和宁婴婴真是有点相似。原来沈 九一直都喜欢这种类型。 秋海棠见状，拍手道： “ 哥哥，他真好玩儿。我有点喜欢他。 ” 秋少爷皮笑肉不笑道： “ 我也很喜欢他呢。 ” 沈九听见 “ 喜欢 ” 二字，不由自主打了个寒噤。 记忆到这里，忽然整个画面黯淡下来。 在场的几个人都倏地消失无踪。沈清秋一怔，立即明白这是出现了梦魔所说的断层情况。 由于原装货留在他体内的记忆残缺不齐，断层会十分频繁。上一段记忆已经结束，现在是 另一段记忆的开始了。 场景还是这间房。沈九这回没被绑，鼻青脸肿趴在地上，手指正狠狠抠着地毯绒子，抠得 手指间血迹斑斑。 忽然，传来轻轻两下叩门声。外边一个少年压低嗓子叫道： “ 小九，小九？ ” 一听这声音，沈九忽的一动，扑到门上去，把脸凑到锁边： “ 七哥！ ” 外边那少年道： “ 小声些，我是偷跑进来的。 ” 沈清秋原先猜不到门外的人是谁，而转念一想，沈九之所以名字里有个九字，是因为在人 贩子手里排行第九，那么往上去，自然也有一二三四五六七八了。 不过，沈九居然也有交好的朋友，这点真让沈清秋稍微有些吃惊。 门上传来嘎啦嘎啦之声，似乎是外边的人在晃门。沈九道： “ 没用。里面外面都锁了五六 道。窗子也锁了。 ” 那少年担忧道： “ 这次没跑成功，他们没把你怎么样吧？ ” 沈九忽的气涌上来，骂道： “ 没把我怎么样？你蠢吗？把我关这儿两天了，打断了我两条 腿。你说呢？！ ” 其实沈清秋看得清楚，他虽然挨了一顿好打，不能行走，两条腿却是好好的，哪里被打断 了。那少年却看不见门内情形，似乎当了真，内疚道： “ 都是我不好。 ” 沈九怒道： “ 当然是你不好！都赖你。那几个新来的咱们又不熟，被他踩就踩踩得了，要 你出什么头！你还怕咱们这种命贱的受不起？！你不出头，我怎么会帮你？我不帮你，怎 么惹到他，姓秋的怎么会买了我？！他不买我，我怎么会这样？！两天一小打三天一大打 ，把我当条狗玩儿！ ” 那少年不住地道： “ 对不起，都是我不好。 ” 果然，沈九这种性格如果有朋友，那对方一定脾气好得惨不忍睹。一连道歉了数声，沈九 才勉强消了气，道： “ 算啦！我这辈子从不讲义气这鬼东西。一生一次的义气就给你了。 ” 那少年感激道： “ 七哥知道。今后一定好好补偿你。 ” 沈九吸吸鼻子，郁郁道： “ 还说什么今后。像你这样一辈子窝在人牙子手里，今后也是当 人牙子的命。 ” 那少年道： “ 小九，我就是来跟你说这件事的。我要走了，今天是来跟你道别的。 ” 沈九吃了一惊，上身立刻坐起： “ 走？你走哪儿去？ ” 被叫做七哥的少年道： “ 我不能在留在这里了。秋家在城里势力大，我们打也打不过，逃 也逃不过。天下修仙术的门派那么多，我要去投一个，学好仙术，回来救你。 ” 沈九眼睛里忽然放出明亮夺目的光彩： “ 七哥，听说东方有一座仙山，每年都会招收资质 优异的弟子，你会去那里吗？ ” 那少年道： “ 我不知道。但是我都会去试试，总有一派肯收我。 ” 沈九喃喃道： “ 要是我没被关在这里，也能和你一道去了 ……” 他脸上忍不住流露出嫉妒之 色，过了会儿，又叹了口气，道： “ 七哥，你今后可千万别那么冲动了。每次都坏事。这 次算我倒霉，可以后你投了那些仙人的门派，还这个样子，那该怎么办啊？ ” 那少年惭愧道： “ 我一定记住。 ” 沈九勉强爬起来，因为有了希望，声音都热切了： “ 七哥，你千万记住说过的话，你一定 要回来救我啊！ ” 七哥仿佛在用力点头，重重地说： “ 好！你且忍一忍，等我学成，一定来带你走！ ” 两个少年隔着一道门，沉默了一阵。沈九问： “ 你走了吗？ ” 那少年忙道： “ 还没呢。我等你说话。 ” 沈九道： “ 七哥，你凑过来，让我从门缝里看一看你吧。也不知道还要过几年才能再见。 ” 那少年道： “ 好。 ” 沈九艰难地挪起身子，把脸朝门缝处凑去。 沈清秋大感好奇，也跟着凑了上去，越过那一道极细的门缝，向外望去。 ……wtf ！ 沈清秋不是在为对方的脸而暴走。如果是的话那就好了，可关键是门外的少年  特么的 长着一张大糊脸！！！ 跟打了马赛克似的！！！ 虽然一开始梦魔就说过，有一定概率出现人脸模糊和记忆断层，可这概率真被沈清秋撞上 了，他还是有一股强烈的呕血 * 。 梦魔巨巨咱就不能把这个 bug 修复一下吗？！ 好想知道这张脸究竟长什么样啊啊啊！ 正当沈清秋准备穿出门，看看距离近点能不能把马赛克消掉时，记忆又断层了。 这次的场景是书房。 秋少爷在案上写字，沈九侍立一旁，给他默默研墨。 这时的沈九已经不再是个瘦弱的少年，身量拔高，在同龄人中算得上修长，站在那里侍奉 ，带着一阵冷淡的书卷之气。 一张纸即将写完时，沈九低眉顺目地说： “ 少爷，有一件事 ……” 秋少爷眼睛也不抬： “ 你想说的，是不是城里那江湖骗子的事？ ” 沈九辩解： “ 那位前辈不是江湖骗子。 ” 秋少爷搁笔，蹙眉道： “ 你就老老实实待在这家里，做你的姑爷，跟我妹妹安心过日子就 行了。老想那么多虚幻之事做什么？ ” 沉默了一阵，突然，沈九咬牙切齿： “…… 过日子过日子 …… 我不想过这样的日子！ ” 秋少爷终于抬起眼皮，瞥了他一眼，蓦地一脚踹在他小腿弯上。 沈九扑通一下，正面栽倒在地。 这两位莫非这么多年了一直是这个相处模式吗 …… 秋少爷起身离座，冷笑道： “ 教了你这么多年，学的东西，居然还比不上江湖骗子的邪门 小伎俩。 ” 沈九碰了一鼻子灰和血，低声道： “ 那不是邪门伎俩，是仙术。 ” 秋少爷蹲 □ 来，拉了拉他的头发，亲昵地道： “ 仙术？难不成你这个小贱种，还想修仙？ ” 沈九一别头，想躲过他的手，秋少爷慢慢拍着他的脑门，动作中饱含侮辱之意，笑道： “ 你人都不算，还想做仙呢？ ”","you…” He couldn’t help but show the envy on his face as he pushed against the door, looking as if he was about to put some sinister plot in motion. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t resist worrying slightly for the person outside. After a while, Shen Jiu sighed again and said, “Seventh Bro, from now on, you must not be so impulsive anymore. It ruins things every time. This time, I just got unlucky, but if you’re still like this later when you join the cultivators’ sect, what will you do then? Be calmer!” Shen Qingqiu inexplicably found it a little comical that Shen Jiu was so young, yet he was still lecturing someone older than him. But the young man wasn’t the least bit unhappy. Instead, he said, ashamed, “I’ll bear it in mind.” Because he had hope now, Shen Jiu’s voice grew passionate. “Hey, you have to remember what you said before. You must come back and save me!” Seventh Bro seemed to be earnestly nodding his head, and he said heavily, “Okay. Wait a little, until I learn it all. I’ll definitely come back and take you away!” The two of them stayed silent for a while, separated by a door. Shen Jiu asked, “Did you leave?” The youth hastily replied, “Not yet. I was waiting for you to speak.” Shen Jiu said, “Seventh Bro, come closer. Let me take a look at you through the crack in the door. I don’t know whether you will… how many years will pass before I can see you again.” The young man laughed and said, “You wanted to say you don’t know whether I’ll die outside, right? Okay.” Shen Jiu spat and said, “You said that yourself! Don’t blame me for saying something cruel.” He shifted closer to the door with difficulty and moved his face close to the crack in the door. Shen Qingqiu was extremely curious as well, and he also moved closer. He passed through the extremely tiny crack in the door and looked outside.CHAPTER 73: EXTRA: AIRPLANE’S FORTUITOUS ENCOUNTER Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky was a stallion writer. A relatively reputable stallion writer. A stallion writer who, even on the Zhongdian novel site with writing deities running all over the place and lesser writers sprouting up like grass on prime soil, was spoken of by others with some frequency. That perseverance in cramming three years’ worth of work into one, releasing ten thousand words a day with expert speed and willpower, those periodic eight-chapter burst releases, that daring energy engulfing the whole country. To those writers who had followed the same path up from openly prostrating themselves on the streets, it was a legend only to be glimpsed but not attained, a myth that would take audiences but not demands. Those harem episodes which had their integrity eaten by dogs, as well as those storylines which had their IQ eaten by dogs, merely signified the defining characteristics of his style enthusiastically discussed by his millions of readers. Regarding his works, the most common assessment was: “A mindless book 285 . Of course it’s a mindless book! But what a satisfying read!” That’s right, Airplane Flying Towards the Sky’s newest masterpiece, Proud Immortal Demon Way, was that typical kind of novel with many haters but even more fans. This sort of plaything was collectively known to everyone as a red book with no reputation. The people who liked it loved it, and the people who hated it could stomp it into the shit and spit on it several times without satisfying their hatred. This type of controversial work would always be a prime breeding ground for people picking fights. For example, right now, while Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky was mindlessly hammering out today’s new content, he opened up a certain well- known novel forum, ready to spout nonsense to freeload points. Hurriedly sweeping his eyes over the page, the first glance made him shudder, having landed on a trending post with an aggressive title bearing his pen name and the title of his book fiercely bobbing up and down on the home page. This was not the first time he had been on the scene while people were fighting over his works. As always, Airplane Shooting Toward the Sky didn’t hesitate to join in on the excitement, gleefully clicking on the link.Sure enough, it was a familiar recipe, familiar taste. #1 Ten Years of Reading Sharpens One SwordOP: After reading webnovels for close to ten years, I’ve never seen a cultivation novel as rotten as Proud Immortal Demon Way. Ah wait, spending day and night eating, sleeping, and collecting sisters, and you fucking tell me this is a cultivation novel. The logic can go die, the writing style can go die, and the author can [bleep] with it, last year I bought a pack [rage] [rage] [rage]. People who like this book come here and tell me, what part of it do you even like? What sort of mindset do you have to be in? How much do you have to hate everyone else to recommend this book? I really can’t bear it, I’m done! #2 Your Infatuated Pupil: I’ve wanted to roast for a long time [sweating]… is there even any meaning to the ranking system? There’s no difference between the golden core in the nascent soul stage and in normal people, every time I see more writing about eating food and sleeping ah I can’t bear to continue, it’s really just spare decoration. And face-slapping once or twice is alright, but if you face-slap thousand times in the same way it’s really just boring. In short, it’s simply not as cool as they say, there’s a bit of an an Amway scam feeling to the whole thing… Anyways this book’s fans are very swift and fierce, I’d estimate they’re going to gang up on you soon, best of luck OP, I’ll send you a pot lid, I’m out. #3 Swordsman Must Say: The writing is shit. All the readers are idiots. #4 You, This Sin Cannot be Forgiven: Who are you calling an idiot up there? What a low character. #5 Taking Red For Green, One After Another: Before I jabbed open this post I knew it would be going in this sort of direction. Every time people start chatting about this book they start arguing  (  ”)  I’ve never seen a single exception. Pull up a chair and watch the fun. #6 You, This Sin Cannot be Forgiven: I’m bored to death of you guys arguing every time. What’s there to argue about, just because you don’t like it doesn’t mean other people won’t like it, it’s really simple logic. If you like it then read it, if not then get lost. Write your own story, you can you up you understand? OP started spewing bs before they even finished, what’s the point of spewing bs just for the sake of spewing? #7 Ten Years of Reading Sharpens One Sword: Watch and see, kiddos. We’ve even gotten a U CAN U UP 286 , this is really just rubbing the dog’s head 287 . Kid, read novels for a few more years. Is it reallygood for you to waste your time on the forums before break, if you can’t finish your homework watch out or your teacher’s going to tell your parents. Just because you like it doesn’t mean other people will like it, I’m quoting your own words back to you. Also, I don’t need to finish eating a ball of shit before I realize it’s a ball of shit, OK? #8 Sha Hualing’s Little Bell: [heart] [drooling] [drooling] I don’t think it’s as rotten as OP says, I like reading this book, I like sister Sha, huehuehue~~~ #9 Peerless Cucumber Expert: I understand what OP is thinking. Lately I’ve been reading this book straight through, it’s so damn long, long and pumped full of filler. I’ve never seen villains with a lower IQ than the ones in this book, the average cannon fodder has an IQ of 40 and the protagonists have an IQ of 60, it’s like the author went on a 24-hour face-slapping craze without losing steam. Most of the female protagonists are stupid flower vases, and you don’t even push down Liu Mingyan, the only righteous one? You don’t push down the righteous empress, are you fucking kidding me? If Airplane’s ever had a girlfriend, I’ll eat this book raw. All my fellow readers have already roasted it for three hundred thousand words, so I’ll stop talking. In fact the most interesting thing are the monsters of the Demon Realm, it’d be best if those were written about more. The rest is just throwing fifty sisters into the family, each one doesn’t even have a distinguishable personality. The writing style is so weird, each time a woman appears it’s “her soft chest trembled”, you could at least try a different phrase for shivering mud, a different word would be fine ah? Seriously, what substitute teacher taught Airplane literature in elementary school? At least the portrayal of the male lead was alright, the transformation from innocent and upstanding to hateful and sinister was detailed and natural, debts of kindness and grudges were paid off, those who should have been killed were mercilessly killed. Seeing that sort of lovey-dovey male lead just makes me want to steal his girl. Bing-ge deserves that ‘ge’, he’s cool enough and blackened enough, I like it, haha! Shen Qingqiu this cheap person doesn’t bear explaining. #10 Cang Qiong Mountain Stair Cleaning Manager: Does anyone here like Yue Zhangmen, I like the gentle gong type the most, whispering, silently passing by. #11 Warrior’s HammerBoring. It’s not written as well asImmortal XX Battle, the difference is huge. This is what’s called a real cultivation novel. #12 You, This Sin Cannot be Forgiven Teacher, trampling on praise feels good doesn’t it, haha. #13 Refusing to be a Potholer The 9th floor’s 288 Cucumber Bro wrote that many words just to hate on it, it must be true love. #14 Ten Years of Reading Sharpens One Sword: To answer floor 12, hehe I don’t dare accept, I’ll return the original to you. Are there not that many Proud Immortal fans who leap up to trample other books? Do you want me to flip through my records for some screenshots to fling in your face? #15 Cang Qiong Mountain Gate Guard Platoon: To answer floor 10, Does anyone here like Yue Zhangmen, whispering, silently passing by. Grab the sister on floor 10! You’re a sister right?! I also like Zhangmen Shixiong! I like him a lot! ☆ \\(  )/ ★ Is there anything more moe than pampering and indulging something with no bottom line! (???) It’s a pity the partner was this disastrous a Shidi, the bad ending was so complete I couldn’t read any comfort out of it… #16: Dear Brother Qingge 289 : Don’t resolve that bitch Shen Qingqiu +10086! My god floor 15 can even moe over this type of scum. I always felt it was a pity Bai Zhan Peak’s Peak Lord died that early, Airplane-juju just refused to write him, or else there would be more CPs to contend with. #17 Occasionally Filling Holes: There’s so much info in those last few levels, did this forum get invaded by weirdos… #18 Peerless CucumberExpert: Upstairs, calm down. This form has a lot of green Dingding Net sisters [sunglasses] #19 A Stately Waiter: It really is true love for Cucumber bro, it’s just the stuff he spews here isn’t as vicious as what he puts in the reviews. Not malicious enough, poor evaluation. #20: Hoeing Wheat is my Noontime Occupation:The Proud Immortal fans are here to stir up trouble again, I see this book everywhere, it makes me want to puke. This book’s quality isn’t worth this much passion, if you say Airplane didn’t invite the navy I wouldn’t believe it. Sit and wait for the next time the skill emperor opens an invitation, look and you’ll know if he got a ticket or not. #21 Hoeing Wheat is my Noontime Occupation To answer floor 4: Who are you calling an idiot up there? What a low character. You’re joking, the schoolkids who like to read rotten books like Proud Immortal have the nerve to talk about character. No one has as low a character as you. #22 Dear Brother Qingge: Because those one or two people firing area cannons are all drunk. Seeing floor 20 stir up the discussion, isn’t this trumpeting for landlord… not to speak of anything else just look at Airplane’s update rate. 10k every day and 25k on the weekends, how many people can do it. En, first put the question of quality to the side. #23 Looking for Hungry Friends at the North Pole Every Day: This fan wrote some Bing-ge x scum Shen slash 290 _(:з) ∠ )_ don’t know if anyone wants to see. It’s so painful, moe over a cold CP is like going to the North Pole, I’m also just courting death looking for CP in a Zhongdian novel. #24 Cang Qiong Mountain Stair Cleaning Manager: The slash writing sister, don’t go! Is it with the eighth letter lord?! Please wuwuwu! #25 Occasionally Filling Holes: Airplane really doesn’t know how to write romance plotlines, best if he just doesn’t. I feel like Luo Binghe doesn’t have feelings for any of his wives, he just wants to use them. And I can’t see any of those women with real moving emotion for him. #26 Warrior’s Hammer: As long as he collects all the sisters it’s fine, it’s whatever if there’s emotion or not. #26 Peerless CucumberExpert 291 Filling Holes Bro on floor 25, you’re joking, you want Airplane not to write the harem? Two-thirds of the book would be gone. #27 Taking Red For Green, One After Another: But I feel like I can see which peak lord has real moving emotion forwhich peak lord… hoping for the skies. Seriously speaking, the scenes he wrote with emotional interactions between brothers were all much more exquisite and natural than Bing-ge’s scenes with his wives, they practically contain deep love visible to the bare eyes. Airplane really is a natural expert fudanshi. PS: The sister on floor 24, beggars can’t be choosers… #28 Hoeing Wheat is my Noontime Occupation: This level was blocked due to personal attack, currently waiting for writer to edit … … … Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky-juju, while stirring his instant noodles with one leg propped, nonchalantly rolled the scroll wheel on his mouse, skimming over the forum posts. His eyes automatically highlighted every message from that familiar ID Peerless Cucumber. Black sniping like a running stream, a cucumber made of iron. Even though this famous lord cucumber would constantly spew criticism without end in his review sections, his subscriptions and urges for updates never slowed a bit. Because of this, he always suspected this person was a masochist. “Very good, you have successfully attracted my attention.” Like some sort of tyrant chairman, Airplane-juju began to nonchalantly observe Cucumber bro’s bluster in the review sections. In the end, he concluded: it’s just like if a woman was married to a disappointing husband, itching to ride on his back, grab him by the neck, and shake; kissing and spitting on him with mixed love and hate. Peerless Cucumber was locked in precisely this kind of inextricable chase while giving a loathing “Why can’t I control this damn author of the novel I chose to read!” “An upright body with a mouth full of resentment!” Airplane-juju laid down his final conclusion and smacked his computer table, howling with laughter. This one smack was disastrous. The instant noodles toppled over, splashing all over his hard working and meritorious beloved keyboard, spicy broth flowing a thousand miles. Airplane turned pale with fright, quickly jumping up to rescue it. But, he jumped too high and his foot caught on the power strip. With a crackle, his laptop screen went dark. After this chain reaction of extreme joy turning to sorrow, Airplane’s face was deathly white.WTFFFFFF! He was just scrolling forums while downloading movies and padding his word count, his file was still open! Fuck, he couldn’t have lost today’s update just like this, he’d gotten to 8000 ah! He subconsciously threw himself down next to the power strip, picking up the the wire to shove it back in the socket And experienced firsthand what could be called “electricity running through the whole body, godly thunder from the Ninth Heaven”."
"沈九抱着头，一语不发。 见他蔫了 , 秋少爷下手的力道轻了些 , 语重心长道： “ 乖乖待着 , 老实本分 , 有什么不好的？你 都十五岁了，年纪不小 , 都要成家了，早错过了修炼的最佳时机，能修出个什么来？你稀 里糊涂跟着走 , 人家还不一定肯要你呢。 ” 作死，简直作死！ 原装货生平最在意的就是他的修为 , 容不得有人比他好，更听不得别人说半句不好，不然 也不会对洛冰河嫉恨得丧心病狂了。 这厮居然敢直接说他没前途！ 沈九猛地一翻手臂 , 把桌案上的墨台抓下 , 朝秋少爷摔去。 这个角度看，也像是在朝沈清秋砸去 , 他下意识往旁边一躲。 墨台当然砸不到他，也砸不到秋少爷，可后者被甩了小半摆子的黑墨点，一件精工细绣的 袍子就这么毁了。 秋少爷的脸立刻垮了下来，呵斥道： “ 我妹妹喜欢你，那是你几世修来的福气！不是我们 家，你现在还在街头扮乞儿坑蒙拐骗讨生活，如今你不愁吃穿还能读书写字，人模狗样的 ，这些是谁给你的？ ” 他把沈九脑袋拍到地上去： “ 分毫不知感恩。 ” 沈九像是豁出去了，恶狠狠地道： “ 我是人。你是个畜生！ ” 勇气可嘉！ 秋少爷一掌把他掼到墙壁上去，骂道： “ 以为这几年你真有点长进了，果然还是烂泥扶不 上墙！ ” 白墙上挂着一柄宝剑，被沈九一撞，坠下地面。沈九跌坐在墙根，手摸到剑柄，情急之下 ，一把抽出，哆哆嗦嗦双手握着，对准眼睛爆满血丝的秋少爷。 后者根本不信他敢真动手，指着他道： “ 火气还挺大。骨头又痒了？ ” 眼看他走近了几步，沈九魂飞魄散，大叫道： “ 别过来！ ” 秋少爷道： “ 没出息！你 ……” 一个 “ 你 ” 字之后，他就再也说不出话了。 慢慢低头，那把剑直接捅进了他肚子里。 秋少爷一脸不可置信，沈九猛地拔出剑来。 沈清秋在一旁那个酸爽 …… 卧槽卧槽卧槽，凶杀现场直播！ 瞬息之间风云变，没说上几句话，惨案就发生了！ 沈九傻了眼，秋少爷一手捂住小腹，气势汹汹夺过剑，一脚把他踹趴下，喊道： “ 来人！ ” 沈九忙扑上去勒他脖子，扭打撕扯中，几名家丁闯了进来，一看到书房里这种场景，大声 喝将起来。沈九又慌又怕，比了个不知道什么诀，秋少爷手里那把剑飞猛地横了出去，几 名家丁被穿膛而过。 再一转头，秋少爷踉踉跄跄朝他走来，猩红的手像要来抓他头发，沈九又是一剑刺出，这 回刺穿了他的肺部。 然后，一剑接一剑，用尽全力，沈九越刺越狠，脸上表情也越发狰狞，一连刺了五十多剑 ，直到尸体面目和要害都血肉模糊，他才气喘吁吁停下手来。 这估计是沈九第一次杀人，更是第一次用自身灵力杀人。 沈清秋目睹全程，震惊了。 第一次就这么凶残！ 他对着满室横尸愣了半晌，忽然清醒过来，哐当一声，扔下了剑，在书房里走来走去。不 过，也只六神无主了一阵，居然极快地镇定了下来。 整个情绪的变化，只花了不到一分钟。这心理素质，沈清秋再次给跪。 沈九定住身形，试探着勾了勾手指。地上那柄触目惊心沾满鲜血的宝剑缓缓升起。 看着飞到他面前的利剑，沈九脸上绽放出奇异的兴奋，一把牢牢握住！ 他甩了甩剑锋，提着凶器跨出书房。沈清秋只站了一会儿，系统传来消息：【温馨提示： 请锁定填坑目标，建议距离不超过 10 米，以保证剧情收集完整！】 原来不跟上填坑目标会遗失得分点？沈清秋忙紧随其后，一步也不敢落下。沈九刚拐了个 角，撞上两个膀大腰圆的家丁。他手臂一挥，冷光横闪，两条肥得流油的脖子一齐被抹了 ，血如喷泉。 沈九几乎见人就杀，越杀越起劲，嘴角阴毒的笑意上扬的越来越厉害。一路惨叫不断，干 脆利落地斩了十来人，沈清秋正看得心惊肉跳，忽然背后传来一声惊叫。 秋海棠站在长廊尽头，愣愣地看着这边。沈九满身鲜血，犹如活鬼，正把剑从一名家丁脖 子里抽出。 秋海棠明媚的脸抽搐了几下，双眼一翻，躺在了在一片血泊之中。 看来这姑娘从前就是个容易在关键时刻晕倒的体质！ 可能是看见秋海棠，稍微冷静了些，沈九握着剑的手垂了下来。他沉吟片刻，朝伙房走 去。 沈清秋注意到，他只杀男人，一个女人也没杀过，性别区分明确，仇恨倾向非常之明显。 小丫鬟和仆妇都躲在厨房角落里不敢出来，他也不特地去灭口。 不久之后，一把火烧了起来。秋府上方夜空的黑云被映得红如炼狱岩浆。 沈九把秋海棠的身子拖到外边一处灌木丛中，身后无声无息现出一人。他回头一看，松了 口气，道： “ 前辈。 ” 这个 “ 前辈 ” ，肯定就是在城中开坛试灵，引得沈九逆心大起的那位高人了。 对方桀桀道： “ 不杀光？ ” 沈九默然片刻，道： “ 我想杀的人，已经死了。 ” 那人道： “ 其实你哥哥说的有一点倒也不错。你天资固然是好的，可已经错过了最佳的修 行年纪，根骨受损。今后应该也能有一番成就，不过，想要更上一层楼，真正登顶，那是 不可能的了。 ” 这人既然听到了秋少爷的话，就说明他把这一桩惨剧从头看到了尾。却无插手之意，反而 作壁上观。看来这位 “ 前辈 ” ，也不是什么温柔角色。沈九若是真跟他走了，怕也不会走什 么阳关大道。 话说回来，沈清秋本以为能十几年结丹就够强悍的了，怎么，原来他这具身体的资质，本 来可以更牛的吗！ 沈九冷冷地说： “ 那畜生不是我哥。事到如今，我还有别的路可走吗？ ” 那人啧啧惋惜道： “ 若是早几年，那又大不一样 ……” 沈九握剑的手背青筋凸起。 那人已转了身，见沈九还站在秋府门口，问道： “ 还不走？你在等谁？ ” 这个 “ 等谁 ” ，应当只是随口的一句反问和催促。 沈九回头望着秋府冲天的火焰，瞳孔也仿佛燃烧了起来。 幸存未死的秋家下人们争先恐后逃出宅中。一片哭嚎声中，只有他这一道苍白的人影顶顶 立在大门前，身上赤黄的火光明明暗暗，交错乱舞。 秋府的大火越烧越旺、梁宇倾塌，沈九被熏得满是烟灰的脸，似乎被冲刷出了一道浅色的 痕迹。 他把剑用力掷出，投入一片火海之中，也跟着转身了。 “ 不等了。 ” 沈清秋就知道。 保证一定会回来救他的那个少年，果然没有回来。 这不是理所当然的吗！ 这是 flag 啊！信誓旦旦保证 “ 我一定会回来的 ” 、 “ 我马上就回来 ” ，都是妥妥的 flag ！ 说这话的人，绝逼就再也见不着影了！ 尤其是这俩孩子想得太美太天真。 一个一个地拜师，一定有一家肯收？完全错！ 即便是拜师成功，过了几年，真的学有所成，见了更广阔的世面，有了更多需要烦心忧虑 的事，他又不一定肯回来找幼时玩伴了。 再加上江湖不测，还有各种飞来横祸的可能性，这少年真能回来解救沈九的概率低于 5% 。 不过，填坑填到这个份上，沈清秋总算能理解向天打飞机说的话是什么意思了。 也难怪他直接砍设定，把 “ 沈清秋 ” 改成个脸谱化的贱人角色了。 真按着原设定写，这类型的角色，绝对吃力不讨好！ 你说他渣吧，他又可怜；你看他可怜，他又的确心狠。又渣又惨的角色，往往是掐掐的盛 宴。 秋海棠更是无辜。爱之深，恨之切，整件事中，她并没做错什么，仇恨却生生把一个天真 无邪的少女，磨成了一个处心积虑苦大仇深的妇人。圣陵里死得更是冤枉。结局还不如原 著种马文来的幸福。 若是当初能顺手拉她一把就好了。 沈清秋正唏嘘，画面忽然像老旧电视机一样，黑白雪花狂闪起来。场景和人脸都扭曲得惨 不忍睹，声音呱唧呱唧，聒噪如外星语。 系统提示：【记忆残缺，损失资料完整度 5% ；损失资料完整度 7% ；损失资料完整度 9%…… 】 记忆断层在不断扩大！ 损失百分点数值越来越高，沈清秋狂拍系统提示框，就像他小时候给人家 “ 修 ” 电视那样， 边拍边喊： “ 调频！调幅！专治信号不良接触不良！ ” 拍了几十掌，居然真有奇效，在资料完整度损失到 10% 的时候，提示音终于戛然而止。 画面雪花陡然消失，转为清晰。 沈清秋这才松了口气，一收手，后退。还没站稳，便瞪大了眼睛。 他身前几步之处，蹲着一个小小的少年。 白白的脸蛋上有几道灰印，脖子上挂着一枚红绳吊着的玉观音，背上捆一个小破布包裹， 正认认真真地在地上吭哧吭哧地 …… 挖坑。 沈清秋脱口而出： “ 洛冰河？ ” 小洛冰河没听见，兀自努力挖坑填土。 环视四周，一片开阔谷地中，数百名年龄不一、男女不限的杂服人士，都在齐刷刷卖力地 …… 挖坑。 沈清秋脑内灵光一闪，抬头望去。 果然，谷地上方，有一块峭立的山石，其上站着两人。 一人身着深色玄端，气度沉稳，专注地俯瞰下方谷地百人。另一人腰悬长剑，几只手指慢 慢转折指间的折扇，青衫如绿水随风起微澜。角度微妙地昂着头，眼珠下转，对下面的蝼 蚁一副爱看不看的姿态。 正是岳清源与 “ 沈清秋 ” 。 这是洛冰河拜师入苍穹山派那年的入山试炼现场。 是的你没看错没错，试炼题目就是挖坑！ 虽然向天打飞机用很多段落以及作者题外话解释过，挖坑不仅仅是挖坑，而是通过看似简 单的运动，测试出挖坑者的耐力、速度、恒心、灵力运作方式，甚至品性等等等等，但沈 清秋一个理由也没记住。 在他心里，扯再多的解释，那就是单纯的挖坑而已！ 这时候的沈九，应当已经坐上了清静峰峰主之位。 苍穹山派的规矩是这样的，十二峰峰主共同进退，接任一起接，退位也一起退，举办仪式 都搭伙挤作一团，归隐更是成群结伴。即便是在任期间，哪位峰主不幸身陨，也只会把他 的位置空出来。 当初沈清秋假死遁的那五年里，清静峰飞峰首之位便是空的。所以不会存在不同辈的峰主 共事的局面。 虽然有特殊情况会比较麻烦，但胜在没有代沟，凝聚力和峰主之间的情感维系特别强。 想到这里，沈清秋忍不住又跳到了另一个规矩上。 历代峰主确认首席弟子后，都会按照字辈给弟子改名，彰显其身份的不同。天底下 “ 清 ×” 的名字那么多，沈九却偏偏分到了一个 “ 秋 ” 字，真是世界的恶意。 沈九对 “ 秋 ” 这个字恨之入骨，偏偏被赐了这个名字，岂不得心塞得要死。连沈清秋也忍不 住想要怜爱 30S 。难怪原装货对上一代清静峰峰主也不怎么尊敬感激了。 话说，修仙之人最忌师从多人，沈九要拜入苍穹山，原先把他带出秋府的那个师父，再留 着恐怕会十分麻烦，只好 “ 死于非命 ” 。 从这点也能推测出，原装货也不是啥懂得感恩的人。 岩石上，两人似乎正在交谈。沈清秋看了一眼埋头努力的小洛冰河，虚虚摸了摸他的脑袋 ，跃上山石，站到两人身边，听他们说话。 岳清源道： “ 今年似乎比往年人还要多。 ” 沈九眯了眯眼，面无喜怒，两指微动，手中折扇微微开合。 侧方走上来一人，向岳清源行礼： “ 掌门师兄。 ” 这人直接无视了站在一旁、怨色都要溢出眼睛的沈九。 这么 * ，除了柳巨巨还能有谁！ 此时的柳清歌正式坐上百战峰之位也应该还没几年，五官轮廓尚能看出两分青涩，气势中 的凌厉尤为明显，行止之间，有种属于年轻人的意气风发。 岳清源道： “ 柳师弟来得正好，不妨看看，哪个好。 ” 柳清歌只看了一眼，道： “ 天资最好是他。 ” 沈清秋满意地点头。柳巨巨眼光果然不错，指的正是背对着三人努力挖坑的洛冰河。 岳清源道： “ 柳师弟可想要？ ” 柳清歌道： “ 要来的，自然会来。 ” 百战峰一向都是：爱来不来，来了就要做好挨打的准备。不主动上百战峰来求打求虐、而 是坐等别人来挑他的弟子，那都是没有战斗力，没有前途的！ 沈九淡淡地道： “ 天资好，未必有所成。 ” 柳清歌连个乜眼都不屑给他，道： “ 比起十六岁才正式修习的野路子，成就一定要高。 ” …… 这两个人从前果然极度不对盘。柳清歌不爱说话，为了嘲讽沈九，居然能说二十个 字！ 如今柳清歌跟自己关系倒还不赖，简直是个奇迹。 岳清源责备道： “ 柳师弟。 ” 柳清歌不听说教，转身就走： “ 练剑去。 ” 说走就走，来去如风。沈九僵立在原地，被他几句话气得发抖，扇骨捏的太用力，咔咔响 了两声。岳清源温言道： “ 柳师弟只是不会说话，你向来知道的，千万不要和他计较。 ” 沈九哼了一声，阴阳怪气，正不知准备说点什么，宁婴婴爬了上来。 她一把抱住沈九的腰，叫道： “ 师尊、师尊，婴婴究竟能不能有师妹，或者师弟啊？ ” 沈九看到她，脸色缓了缓，道： “ 想要师弟师妹？ ” 宁婴婴连连点头。沈九抬起头，展扇摇了摇。 他忽然道： “ 我要那个孩子。 ” 他盯的是洛冰河，岳清源一怔。 原装货此前对待天资优异徒弟的斑斑劣迹，估计早已闻名全派上下了，这时候又开口找岳 清源讨要好苗子，实在 …… 不能不好好斟酌。 见岳清源沉吟不答，沈九又冷冷重复了一次： “ 我要他。 ” 跟掌门也这么说话，找打吗？！ 谁知，岳清源缓缓点头，真的同意了： “ 好。 ” 沈清秋彻底无语。 岳清源居然还能容忍他 …… 好醉！ 这具身体究竟是怎么安然无事活到今天的！ 还有柳巨巨。搞半天，沈九非要把洛冰河讨到自己手上，原来是你害的！ 宁婴婴欢呼一声，奔下岩石，到谷底人群中去拉洛冰河。 这一段，就是原著中洛冰河拜入 “ 沈清秋 ” 门下的开场！ 不过，因为是男主视角，向天打飞机菊苣可没有把这三位峰主之间的暗涌也写出来，而是 直接从香喷喷的小萝莉拉走洛冰河开始下笔的。 相信每一个读者看到那一段，都和当时的沈垣一样，以为这是男主一生狗屎运桃花运不断 的开门红。 殊不知，这根本是虐童实录前的一丢丢糖渣渣！ 沈清秋知道接下来等着洛冰河的是什么。 可他只能干着急。真想和他说，别去！！！ 洛冰河随着宁婴婴来到清静峰竹舍。沈九坐在沈清秋最常坐的那个位置，端着茶盏，兀自 刮着茶叶。 他早早支走了叽叽喳喳的宁婴婴。明帆侍立一旁，代他开口： “ 今天开始起，你就留在清 静峰。 ” 小洛冰河的脸涌上一层惊喜的晕红，规规矩矩跪下行礼，清脆的声音朗朗地道： “ 弟子洛 冰河，见过师尊！ ” 沈九扯了一下嘴角，总算把茶盏从下巴边挪开了。 他慢条斯理道： “ 你为什么要来苍穹山派？ ” 洛冰河腼腆道： “ 弟子仰慕仙山上诸位仙师风采，如能拜入门下，弟子学有所成，母亲在 天之灵亦能安宁。 ” 沈清秋知道，这是他来时路上反复想了无数次的答案。 沈九 “ 哦 ” 了一声，道： “ 家中有母亲？ ” 他看似漫不经心地问： “ 母亲怎么样？ ” 洛冰河认真地说： “ 母亲是这世上对我最好的人。 ” 沈九的脸抽了抽，抬手让他打住。 他上下打量洛冰河一番，道： “ 的确是最适合修行的年纪。 ” 沈清秋能从原装货脸上看出三个词。 嫉妒，嫉妒，还是嫉妒。 嫉妒洛冰河有 “ 世界上对他最好的母亲 ” ，嫉妒洛冰河的天资，嫉妒洛冰河在最合适的年纪 拜入了苍穹山派。 跟一个小孩子嫉妒，他就是这样的人。 沈九站起身来，朝洛冰河一步一步走去。 沈清秋下意识挡在他面前，可哪里挡得住？ 洛冰河仰起脸，看着向他走过来的清静峰峰主，仿佛仰望天神。 谁知，天神目不斜视地侧身走过了他，顺手将手中那盏茶水，连杯带盖浇在了他身上。 茶不是刚泡的，只有七分烫，可洛冰河还是整个人都呆住了。 明帆嗒嗒跟上径自负手走出竹舍的沈九，回头呵斥道： “ 跪好！师尊不让你起来，你要是 敢起来，当心把你吊起来打！ ” …… 沈清秋第一次发现，明帆这孩子，在作死炮灰这方面的天赋，真是满格的！ 洛冰河刚刚拜师入门，正满心欢喜、满心感激，突然莫名其妙被迎面泼了一桶冰块夹水， 整颗心都冷了熄了。 他呆呆地跪在原地，眼睛一眨不眨。 无声之中，两颗泪珠滚下眼眶。 这是洛冰河自从养母死后第一次哭，也是在苍穹山派最后一次哭。 自此以后，他无论受了多大委屈，无论原装货为了发泄扭曲的情绪如何虐待他，洛冰河都 再也没哭过。 沈清秋蹲在他面前，可袖子举起便穿透过去，碰都碰不到，抱也抱不了，连想给他擦擦眼 泪都办不到，难受得想死，心疼得要命。 明知洛冰河听不到，他还是说： “ 不哭了哈。 ” 洛冰河盯着自己的膝盖，拳头在腿上慢慢握紧，眼泪越流越凶，滴滴坠在衣襟上。 沈清秋徒劳地擦着他的脸颊，哄道： “ 师尊再也不打你了。别哭了。 ” 洛冰河抬起手掌，揉了揉眼睛，将地上的茶杯收拾好，放到一旁，握一握心口那枚玉佩， 端正了跪姿。 沈清秋知道他此刻的心理活动。 肯定是自己哪里做得不对，惹恼了峰主，这才要给他个教训。跪一跪师父也是应该的。 再见到他这个举动，沈清秋忍不住面对着他，跪了下去，伸出手，把洛冰河整个小小的身 体紧紧揽在虚无的怀抱里。 再一次睁开眼睛时，雪白的床幔和四角流苏占据了整个视线。 突然间看到不一样的场景，沈清秋还没反应过来，一动不动。 岳清源的声音从旁边传来： “ 醒了？ ” 沈清秋机械地又眨了几下眼睛，嗓子有点干，勉强出声道： “ 师兄。 ” 岳清源坐在床边，看了他一阵，道： “ 你一直在叫洛冰河的名字。 ” 沈清秋： “…… 哦。 ” 岳清源： “ 边哭边叫。 ” 沈清秋擦了一把脸，这才发现，除了冷汗，真的糊了一脸的泪水。 草，眼泪这玩意儿，果然感染力强。 “……” 他心虚地说： “ 师兄你听我解释 ……” 解释个毛线！ 能解释什么？ 什么理由才能够使 “ 沈峰主梦里边哭边叫自己徒弟名字 ” 这个事实听起来让人信服？！ 见他说不出话，岳清源叹了口气，道： “ 算了。醒了就好，不必解释。 ” 沈清秋讪讪地坐起。忽然觉得这个场景有点熟悉。 说起来，第一次在这个世界醒的时候，也是岳清源守在他床边。 岳清源观察他脸色，道： “ 你睡了五天。还要不要继续再睡？ ” 睡了五天！ 沈清秋险些没当场再倒下去。 怎么不一觉睡到天琅君他们打过来！ 猪一样，还醒个屁！ 系统：【填坑项目 “ 沈九 ” ，完成进度 70% 】 才完成 70% ！ 等等，除去记忆残缺导致资料不全的那 10% ，还有 20% 呢？到哪儿去了！ 没时间想那么多了，沈清秋一把抓住岳清源道： “ 师兄，下雪第一天，在洛川！ ” 发现自己过于激动，语无伦次，他定了定神，换了一副从容严肃的神情，道： “ 我的意思 是，天琅君很可能在这个时间这个地方，用心魔剑打开两界入口，开始合并。 ” 岳清源： “ 你怎么知道？ ” 沈清秋又卡了。 他能说，因为原著写过，这个时间和这个地点是最适合的吗！ 沈清秋： “…… 我在天琅君手里呆过一段时间。 ” 岳清源： “ 所以他就直接告诉你了？ ” 事出突然，沈清秋一时间找不到理由，只能硬着头皮说： “ 师兄千万要相信我。 ” 岳清源看了他半晌，闭目一阵，站起身来，温言道： “ 你先休息。这件事交给其余的同门 便好。 ” 休息。是指睡觉吗？ 都睡了五天了！ 金丹还要睡这么多天，换一本小说真是要被笑掉大牙！ 岳清源前脚刚走，沈清秋后脚便一骨碌从床上滚下，到处找外衫。 正团团乱转，冷不防一人欺近身后，一只手蒙住了他的眼睛。 沈清秋下意识一肘击去，喝道： “ 谁！ ” 胆子这么大，又爱和他玩这种无聊把戏，还能有谁？ 他的手肘被稳稳接住，一个熟悉的声音在他耳边道： “ 师尊不如猜猜？ ” 都开口说话还叫师尊了，还猜个毛线！ 沈清秋翻了个白眼，背后那人忽然把他腰一搂，滚到一旁的竹榻上。 两个人的重量压得竹枝嘎吱作响。眼前的遮挡物移开，果然是洛冰河。 他的手改为捂着沈清秋的嘴，道： “ 别眨眼睛。师尊睫毛好长，刮得我手痒，心里也痒。 ” 你才睫毛长，睫毛最长的就是你！ 沈清秋一连眨了几十次眼睛以示怒意。洛冰河笑了笑，啾的一下，亲了亲他的眼皮。 他说： “ 千万别叫。万一在清静峰被人发现，师尊多年清誉就真的毁于一旦了。 ” 呵呵。 还有个屁的清誉，早就毁的差不多了。 洛冰河顺着沈清秋的眼睛，一路亲下去，道： “ 我说了要来接你的。这么多天没见，师尊 想我不想？ ” 按照沈清秋的标准答案，应该是先一个膝弯顶上他小腹，把这逆徒踢下榻去，再优雅地整 理一下仪容，最后回一句冷艳高贵的 “ 不想 ” 。 可不知怎么的，想到刚才记忆中洛冰河孤零零跪在竹舍中，默默收拾地上茶杯的模样，这 腿怎么也抬不起来。 沈清秋连呼吸也像在洛冰河手掌心里颤抖了起来。 他闭上双眼，点了点头。","CHAPTER 74: RIGHT ON SCHEDULE … WTF! Shen Qingqiu’s outburst wasn’t because of the other’s face. If only that were the case, but the crucial thing was that the youth outside the doorfuck, his entire face was burnt off. It was like there was a mosaic over the whole thing! Even though the Dream Demon had said at the start that there was a certain possibility of people’s faces being obscured or ruptures appearing in the memoryafter actually running into this possibility, Shen Qingqiu felt an intense desire to vomit blood. Dream Demon-juju, can’t we give fixing this bug a go? I really want to know what this face looks like ah ah ah! Just when Shen Qingqiu wanted to pass through the door and see if closing the distance could make the mosaic drop off, another rupture appeared in the memory. This time, the setting was a study. Young Master Qiu was writing on a table. Shen Jiu stood in attendance to the side, silently grinding his ink. The Shen Jiu of this time was still a thin and weak youth, but he had stretched in the vertical direction. Among his peers, he would count as rather tall and thin. Standing there to wait upon Young Master Qiu, he gave off a kind of cold and tranquil scholarly aura. When one sheet of paper was almost complete, Shen Jiu spoke, head lowered and gaze obediently. “Young Master, there’s one matter…” Young Master Qiu didn’t even lift his eyes. “The matter you wish to speak of, is it that charlatan in the city 292 ?” Shen Jiu defended, “Elder Wu Yanzi isn’t a charlatan.” Young Master Qiu set down his brush and frowned. “Just behave yourself and stay at home, be a good son-in-law, stay peacefully with my younger sister and live your life, that’s enough. What use is thinking of those illusory fantasies all the time?” After a spell of silence, Shen Jiu suddenly gritted out, “Live your life, live your life… I don’t want to live this sort of life!” Young Master Qiu finally lifted his eyes. Shooting him a gaze, he suddenly shot out a foot and kicked him in the back of the knees. With a plop, Shen Jiu smacked face-first into the ground. Shen Qingqiusubconsciously rubbed his own intact calves. Could it be that these two spent this many years with this mode of interaction… Young Master Qiu rose from his seat and sneered, “I taught you this many years, and the things you’ve learned can’t even compare to that charlatan’s evil little tricks.” Shen Jiu, nose covered in ash and blood from his fall, lifted his head to scoff with a faint air of arrogance. “They aren’t evil little tricks; they’re immortal techniques. Someone with a trash constitution like you can only call them charlatans to trick and comfort yourself.” Young Master Qiu crouched down. Grabbing a handful of his hair, he crooned in his ear, “Immortal techniques? Could it be that you, these little cheap goods, want to cultivate to immortality?” Shen Jiu tilted his head to avoid his grasp, but Young Master Qiu gave him a slow pat on the forehead, the action brimming with intent to insult. He smiled, “You don’t even count as human, and you still want to become an immortal?” Shen Jiu held his head, not saying a word. Seeing him wilt like this, Young Master Qiu did lessen the strength of his grip a bit, and his next words were serious and heartfelt. “Staying here obediently, being well-behaved and playing your partwhat’s so bad about that? You’re fifteen already. You’re not young; you’re even about to get married. You’ve long missed the optimal time to begin cultivatingwhat can you become? If you muddle along with him, he isn’t even guaranteed to want you.” This was just looking for death. The thing the original goods cared the most about in life was his cultivation. He couldn’t tolerate anyone being better than him, and especially couldn’t tolerate others saying half a bad sentence about him. Or else, he wouldn’t have been driven into such a deranged state out of resentment for Luo Binghe. And this guy dared to out and say he had no prospects! Shen Jiu suddenly turned his arm, grabbing the inkstone on the table and throwing it towards Young Master Qiu. From this angle, it looked like it was flying towards Shen Qingqiu, and he subconsciously dodged to the side. Of course, the inkstone couldn’t hit him, and it couldn’t hit Young Master Qiu either. But, the latter was covered in a half arc of black ink spray, a set of exquisitely embroidered robes ruined just like that. Young Master Qiu’s face promptly collapsed, and he berated, “Tang-er likes you, that’s good fortune you’ve collected over several of your lifetimes! If not for our family, right nowyou would be on the street begging and swindling to eke out a living. This life you havewithout worry for food or clothes and the chance to read and write, who gave it to you?” He slapped Shen Jiu’s head down onto the ground. “Not the least bit of gratitude!” Shen Jiu seemed to have thrown caution to the wind, viciously spitting, “I am human. Why do I have to feel gratitude towards a beast?” Praiseworthy courage! Young Master Qiu one-handedly flung him to the wall, cursing, “I thought you’d actually made some progress in these few years, but it turns out rotten mud really doesn’t stick to the wall 293 !” A sword hung on the white wall. When Shen Jiu knocked into it, it dropped to the ground. Shen Jiu collapsed into a seated position at the foot of the wall, found the hilt with his hand, and, in a moment of desperation, drew the blade with a shaky two-handed grip and pointed it at the red-eyed Young Master Qiu. The latter didn’t at all believe he would actually make a move, pointing at him and saying, “You’re quite fired up. Are your bones itching?” Seeing him approach a few steps closer, Shen Jiu’s soul just about flew off in fright. He yelled, “Don’t come over here!” Young Master Qiu said, “No future prospects! You…” After this “You,” he would never again speak a word. Slowly lowering his head, he saw that sword sticking straight into his stomach. While Young Master Qiu’s face was still full of disbelief, Shen Jiu suddenly pulled out the sword. Shen Qingqiu stood to the side, enraptured… Fuck, fuck, fuck, an on-site live broadcast of murder! The atmosphere changed in such a split second. They hadn’t even spoken a few sentences and a massacre occurred! Shen Jiu stood in a daze. One hand covering his abdomen, Young Master Qiu aggressively snatched back the sword and kicked him to the ground, yelling, “Help!” Shen Jiu hurriedly threw himself over to grab his boots. During the ensuing violent scuffle, a few old servants rushed in the door. Seeing this type of scene in the study, they began to shout in loud voices. Shen Jiu, in panic and fear, made some sort of seal and the sword in Young Master Qiu’s handsuddenly shot out to skewer the old servants through their chests. The next he turned his head, Young Master Qiu was staggering towards him, scarlet-covered hands reaching for his hair. Shen Jiu stabbed out again, this time piercing his lung. And then, stab after stab, using his full strength, Shen Jiu stabbed fifty times in a row, fiercer and fiercer, the expression on his face growing more and more malevolent until the body’s face and vitals were a bloody mess of flesh. Then, he finally stopped, panting for breath. This must have been Shen Jiu’s first kill, and the first time he killed someone using his own spiritual energy. Shen Qingqiu watched from beginning to end, astonished. The first time and already this savage! Shen Jiu stared blankly at the room full of toppled corpses for a while. Suddenly, he awakened, throwing down the sword with a clang. He paced back and forth through the study, subconsciously wiping his hands on his clothes again and again, looking like he was out of his wits 294 . But, he was only distracted for a spell and managed to calm down extremely quickly. This whole process of changing states of mind took less than a minute. This type of mind. Shen Jiu halted, experimentally hooking his finger. The ghastly blood- covered sword on the ground slowly rose. Seeing the sharp sword flying before him, a strange sort of excitement blossomed on Shen Jiu’s face, and he took the sword firmly in his grasp! He flicked the point of the sword and strode out of the study, murder weapon in hand. Shen Qingqiu stood for a while before the System notified: Hint: please focus on the plot hole-filling objective. Recommended distance is within 10 meters to guarantee the complete collection of plot line! So if he doesn’t follow, he’ll lose points on the plot hole-filling objective? Shen Qingqiu hurriedly went to follow behind, not daring to fall behind a single step. Shen Jiu had just turned a corner when he ran into two burly house servants. With a wave of his arm, a cold light flashed out to skirt against two oily-fat necks and blood spurted like fountains. Shen Jiu was practically killing people on sight. The more he killed, the more enthusiastic he was; the sinister smile at the corner of his mouth tilted up into a more and more ferocious expression. Unceasing blood-curdling screams followed his path as he efficiently beheaded a dozen people. Shen Qingqiu noticed that he only killed men and not a single woman. The division between sexes was clear, and the direction of his hatred was very obvious. The littlemaids and servant women all hid in the corners of the kitchen, not daring to come out, and he didn’t go out of his way to silence them. While watching this shocking scene in trepidation, a cry of fear suddenly sounded out from behind 295 . Qiu Haitang stood at the end of the long corridor, blankly staring in their direction. Shen Jiu was covered in fresh blood like some sort of living ghoul, just drawing his sword from a servant’s neck. Qiu Haitang’s bright and beautiful face twitched a few times. Her eyes rolling back, she collapsed in a puddle of blood. Clearly, this girl was the type to faint at crucial times all along. Seeing Qiu Haitang, Shen Jiu cooled down a bit and his sword hand drooped down. After muttering to himself for a bit, he set off for the kitchen. Not long after, a fire began to burn. The black night clouds above the Qiu residence reflected red light like the lava of purgatory. Shen Jiu had dragged Qiu Haitang’s body outside into a shrub when a wordless figure appeared from behind. He threw his head around, sword in hand and an ominous glint in his eye, but let out a held breath when he saw who it was. “Elder.” This “Elder” had to be that Wu Yanzi who set up shop in the city to show off spiritual tricks, the one who incited Shen Jiu’s rebellious uprising. The other said cruelly, “You didn’t kill them all?” Shen Jiu was silent for a time, then said, “The person I wanted to kill is already dead.” The person said, “Actually, one of the things your brother said was not wrong. Though your innate talent is admittedly good, you’ve already passed the optimal time to begin cultivating. In addition, after suffering torture, even your bones are somewhat damaged. From now on you should be able to achieve some success, but actually climbing to the peak is impossible. If it were a few years earlier, then it would be a different question.” Since this person had heard Young Master Qiu’s words, that meant he had watched this wretched play from head to tail. But, he had no intention of interfering, only making like a wall to observe. Looks like this “Elder” wasn’t any sort of gentle character. If Shen Jiu really followed him, it probably wouldn’t be on any sunlit open road. Shen Qingqiu had thought that even after entering late, one could reach core formation in ten or so years. This body’s aptitude was already quite impressivehow could he guess that the original Shen Qingqiu’s ability wasanother level higher? Knowing the truth of the situation, even an unambitious person like him would inevitably sigh in regret. In addition, it wasn’t hard to understand why the ambitious and aggressive original goods always had a heart full of resentment and always felt aggrieved. After all, it hurt much more to have had and lost than never to have had at all. Blue veins popped up on Shen Jiu’s sword hand. He said coldly, “That beast isn’t my brother. In addition, now that things have reached this stage, is there another path I can take? Are you giving me another path?” That person had already turned around. Seeing Shen Jiu still standing at the gate of the Qiu residence, he asked, “You’re still not coming? Who are you waiting for?” This “Who are you waiting for?” should have just been a throwaway rhetorical question, meant to urge him to follow. Shen Jiu turned to gaze into the blaze shooting into the sky, his pupils seeming to ignite along with the Qiu residence. The lucky survivors of the Qiu house servants fought to escape, all fearing to be the last. In the chaos of cries and howls, only his pale silhouette stood steadfast in front of the gate, scarlet and yellow firelight playing shadows across his body, intertwining in a messy dance. The fire in the Qiu residence blazed higher and higher, and the roof beams collapsed. A pale track seemed to have washed itself into the layer of ash on Shen Jiu’s smoke-covered face. He forcibly tossed the sword into a sea of fire, turning to follow his master. “I won’t wait anymore.” It was then that Shen Qingqiu knew that the youth who promised to come back and save himturns out he didn’t come back after all. Wasn’t this natural and inevitable? This was a legendary flag ah. It’s one of the two great flags along with “I’ll come back home and get married.” People who solemnly vow that “I’ll definitely come back” or “I’ll come back right away”you’ll definitely never see a shadow of them again! In particular, these two kids’ wishes were too beautiful, too naive. If they went to find a master one by one, was it certain that there’ll be one house that’ll accept both? Completely wrong. Even if he successfully found a master and, after a few years, really achieved some success in his education, after seeing the face of the wide world and gaining more worries that demand his attention, it’s not certain he would bewilling to come back to find his childhood playmate. In addition, the jianghu was unpredictable and full of all kinds of unexpected dangers. All in all, the chance that this youth would really be able to come back and save Shen Jiu was less than 5%. But, after getting to this stage in the plot hole-filling, Shen Qingqiu could understand Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky’s outline-chopping tendencies a little bit more. If he actually wrote this type of character with his original backstory, it would definitely be an arduous and thankless task. If you said he was scum, he was also pitiful; if you pitied him, he was undeniably ruthless. A character who was both scum and wretched was usually a godly body and prime disaster area for fights to break out. Might as well chop him down into a bare-faced cheap character for the protagonist to stomp under his footeasier to write and more satisfying for the readers. Nevertheless, Qiu Haitang was innocent. Her love was deep, her hate was righteous, and she hadn’t really done anything wrong in this whole affair. But, revenge had ground this artless and innocent girl into a bitter woman with a heart full of schemes. Her death in the Holy Mausoleum was even more of an injustice. Her conclusion wasn’t even as fortuitous as the one she got in the original stallion novel. If he was able to give her a hand at the beginning, that was for the best. Right when Shen Qingqiu was sighing in sorrow, the scene suddenly warped like a picture on an old TV, black and white snowflakes flashing wildly. The scenery and people’s faces all distorted into a spectacle too horrible to see, the sound scritching, the clamor as if in an alien language. The System notified:Memory badly damaged, data loss at 5%; data loss at 7%; data loss at 9%… The ruptures in the memory were getting bigger and bigger! The loss percentage grew higher and higher. Shen Qingqiu madly slapped the System notification window like how he tried to “fix” bad signal or bad connection on the TV when it was little. After a couple dozen slaps, it was actually weirdly effective. The data loss percentage hit 10%, and the notification sounds finally ground to a stop. The snowflakes in the scene suddenly disappeared and the picture became clear. Shen Qingqiu finally released a held breath, withdrawing his hand and retreating. Before he had steadied his stance, he stopped to stare. A few steps in front of him squatted a small young boy.A few streaks of ash crossed a pale and tender face that might have accidentally been smeared there when wiping sweat. A jade Guanyin on a red rope hung around his neck and a shivering rag bundle was tied on his back. He was earnestly huffing and puffing on the ground… digging a hole. Shen Qingqiu blurted out, “Luo Binghe?” Little Luo Binghe didn’t hear him, still striving to dig holes and fill them with dirt. Casting a glance around his surroundings, hundreds of boys and girls of mixed clothing and differing ages stood in an open valley, each putting their whole strength into… digging holes. A realization flashed through Shen Qingqiu’s head, and he raised his head to look. Sure enough, above the valley was a steep mountain cliff and two people standing atop its peak. One wore dark-colored ceremonial robes, bearing steady and calm, overlooking the people in the valley with fixed attention 296 . A longsword hung at the other’s waist and a folding fan slowly turned between his fingers. His robes were green as clear water, ripples stirred by the wind. He subtly raised his head, looking askance at the ants below like he didn’t particularly care to watch. That’s right, it was Yue Qingyuan and “Shen Qingqiu.” This was Luo Binghe’s trial site the year he took a master and entered Cang Qiong Mountain. You didn’t see wrong; you’re not wrongthe trial subject was digging holes! Even though Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky had spent many paragraphs and author notes explaining that digging holes was not just digging holes, but a way to test through a seemingly simple action the hole-digger’s endurance, speed, perseverance, spiritual methods, even their character etc. etc., Shen Qingqiu didn’t remember a single justification. In his heart, no matter how many explanations you rip out it was just digging holes, pure and simple! The Shen Jiu of this time should have already taken the seat of Qing Jing Peak Lord. Cang Qiong Mountain Sect’s rules were like this: the twelve Peak Lords advance and retreat together. They receive their assignments together, and when they abdicate they abdicate together too. When they hold ceremonies, they would partner up and crowd into a clump, and especially when they retreat into seclusion they would join up and retreat in groups. Even if any Peak Lord meets misfortune and perishes in office, they would just leave their seat empty. Thosefive years Shen Qingqiu had faked his death and fled, the Qing Jing Peak Lord’s seat had remained empty. This was so that there wouldn’t be a situation of Peak Lords of different generations working together. Even though there were extenuating circumstances when this rule would be rather inconvenient, it had succeeded in preventing a generational gap, and it maintained particularly strong cohesion and bonds between Peak Lords. Thinking of this, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t resist jumping to another rule. After the past generation of Peak Lords confirmed their head disciples, they would change their disciples’ names according to the generation name to demonstrate their change in status 297 . Out of all the “QingX” names under the sky, Shen Jiu was unfortunately given the character “Qiu.” It was truly the malice of the world 298 . Shen Jiu hated this character “Qiu” to the bone. Having this name, of all things, conferred upon him, how couldn’t he feel sick to death at heart? Even Shen Qingqiu couldn’t resist wanting a tender moment of silence for this guy. No wonder the original goods didn’t hold much reverence and gratitude towards the last generation’s Qing Jing Peak Lord. On top of the cliff, the two people seemed to be having a discussion. Shen Qingqiu looked at the small Luo Binghe, immersed in his endeavor. He placed an immaterial pat on his head, then leaped up the cliff to stand beside the two people and listen to their conversation. Yue Qingyuan said, “This year, there seem to be even more people than in years past.” Shen Jiu narrowed his eyes, no happiness or anger on his face. Two fingers twitched, the folding fan in his hand spreading slightly open. A person walked up from the side, greeting Yue Qingyuan: “Sect Leader- shixiong.” This person did not even spare a glance for Shen Jiu, the one standing to the side, resentment about to spill over from his eyes. This cool a character, who could it be but Liu-juju! The Liu Qingge of this time had only officially occupied the seat of Bai Zhan Peak Lord for a couple of years, and an unseasoned air was still visible in the outline of his features. His gaze was swift and fierce, and there was a type of youthful mettle beneath his movements. Yue Qingyuan said, “Liu-shidi, you’ve come just in time. There’s no harm in looking. See which ones are good.” Liu Qingge only took one look and said, “He has the best innate talent.”Shen Qingqiu nodded, pleased. Sure enough, Liu-juju had some good eyes. The one he pointed to was precisely Luo Binghe, his back towards the three, still striving to dig holes. Yue Qingyuan said, “Liu-shidi, do you want him?” Liu Qingge said, “If he wants to come, he’ll come himself.” Bai Zhan Peak was always like this: whether you wanted to come or not, if you came then get ready to get thrashed. If you didn’t take the initiative to go up to Bai Zhan Peak crying and shouting, looking for tyrannical beatings, but sit there waiting for others to pick their disciples, then you had no way forward, destined not to find your fate at Bai Zhan Peak. Shen Jiu said placidly, “Good natural talent doesn’t guarantee any achievement.” Liu Qingge didn’t spare him a trifling glance. “Compared to the unorthodox method of officially starting cultivation at sixteen, achievement will definitely be higher.” … Sure enough, these two despised each other from the beginning. Liu Qingge didn’t like to talk, he especially didn’t like to talk with people he disliked, but he even got out sixteen words to taunt Shen Jiu! His okay relationship with Liu Qingge today was nothing short of a miracle. Yue Qingyuan reprimanded, “Liu-shidi.” Liu Qingge didn’t listen to his preaching, turning to leave. “Going to practice.” Says he’ll go and he goes, coming and going like the wind. Shen Jiu was rooted to the spot, shaking with anger at his few sentences. He squeezed his fan with too much strength and the ribs cracked under his grip. Yue Qingyuan said helplessly, “Liu-shidi just doesn’t know how to talk; you’ve always known not to let him get under your skin.” Shen Jiu humphed, giving off a strange air. Before they got a chance to find out what he was preparing to say, Ning Yingying climbed up. She hugged Shen Jiu’s waist and shouted, “Shizun, Shizun, will Yingying have a shimei or shidi?” Seeing her, Shen Jiu’s face relaxed. “Do you want a shidi or shimei?” Ning Yingying nodded over and over. Shen Jiu lifted his head, waved his open fan, and once again carefully calculated something with narrowed eyes. He suddenly said, “I want that kid.” He was staring at Luo Binghe. Yue Qingyuan started.He’d reckon the original goods’ spotty record of treatment towards disciples with exceptional innate talent was long renowned throughout the whole sect. Now that he was opening his mouth to ask the Sect Leader for the good seedlings, Shen Qingqiu could understand Yue Qingyuan’s hesitation. It was really… something you couldn’t be too careful in considering. Seeing Yue Qingyuan muttering to himself, not answering, Shen Jiu coldly repeated himself. “I want him.” Daring to speak like this to the Sect Leader, are you looking for a beating? Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. Unexpectedly, Yue Qingyuan slowly noddedhe really agreed. “Okay.” Shen Qingqiu had nothing to say. That Yue Qingyuan could still tolerate him… how did this body live peacefully until today! And there was Liu-juju. So it turns out the reason why the original goods was so bent on getting Luo Binghe into his own hands was the root of the problem you buried! Ning Yingying cheered, rushing down the cliff to pull Luo Binghe out from the crowd in the valley. This section was the beginning of the “Luo Binghe comes under ‘Shen Qingqiu’s’ tutelage” arc in the original work! But, because it was the male protagonist’s POV, Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky-juju didn’t bother describing in detail the bright currents and dark tides between these three Peak Lords. Instead, he started to put pen to paper right where a fragrant little loli suddenly dropped from the sky to pull out Luo Binghe. He would believe that seeing this section, every single reader, like Shen Yuan at that time, thought this was the fortuitous opening of the protagonist’s life-long bullshit luck in continuous romance plots. Little could they have imagined this was just a scrap of candy before the big knives came stabbing down. Shen Qingqiu knew what was waiting for Luo Binghe next. But, he could only look on helplessly and watchwatch Luo Binghe follow Ning Yingying into the bamboo house on Qing Jing Peak. Shen Jiu sat in Shen Qingqiu’s favorite seat holding a teacup, still blowing on the leaves. He had long sent away the chattering Ning Yingying. Ming Fan stood in attendance to the side and started to speak for him. “From now on, you will stay at Qing Jing Peak.” A surprised and flush rose on little Luo Binghe’s face. He kneeled down to present his orderly salutations in a clear voice. “This disciple Luo Binghe hasseen Shizun!” Shen Jiu tugged at the corner of his lip, at long last lowering the teacup from his chin. He said leisurely, “Tell us, why did you come to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect?” Like he was reciting a lesson, nervous but conscientious, Luo Binghe said, “This disciple has admired the elegant manner of all the masters atop this mountain of immortals since youth. If I could gain entry and achieve success in my studies, my mother’s spirit in heaven could also be gratified.” Shen Qingqiu knew this was the answer he had tossed and turned again and again on the road here to polish. Shen Jiu let out an “oh.” “You had a mother at home?” He said, almost absent-mindedly, “What was she like?” Luo Binghe raised his smiling face, both eyes sparkling. “My mother was the person who was best to me in this world.” Shen Jiu’s face twitched, raising a hand to stop him. He looked Luo Binghe up and down. “You are indeed at the age that’s best for cultivation.” Shen Qingqiu could see three words on the original goods’ face. Envy, envy, and more envy. He envied Luo Binghe’s “mother who was best to me in the world,” envied Luo Binghe’s innate talent, envied that Luo Binghe was accepted into Cang Qiong Mountain Sect at the optimal age. To have an indignant heart full of envy for a small child, he really was this type of person. Shen Jiu stood up, walking over to Luo Binghe step by step. Shen Qingqiu subconsciously blocked him, but how could he stop him? Luo Binghe lifted his face and looked at the Qing Jing Peak Lord walking towards him like he was beholding a god. But who would have thought the god would walk by him without a sideways glance and pour the cup of tea in his hand onto him as he passed, lid and all? The tea wasn’t just boiled, so it was only somewhat hot, but Luo Binghe’s whole body was frozen, dumbfounded. Shen Jiu, hands tucked behind his back, walked out of the bamboo house without taking his leave. Ming Fan tapped along behind, turning round to chide, “Kneel down! Shizun didn’t tell you to rise. If you dare to rise, I swear I’ll hang you up for a beating then shut you in the woodshed for three days!”… This was the first time Shen Qingqiu discoveredthis kid Ming Fan, his gift for looking for death like a cannon fodder really was fully leveled! Luo Binghe had just been accepted into the sect, so his heart had been full of joy and gratitude. After inexplicably getting tea poured over his head for no reason, it was like a bucket full of cold water with ice cubes mixed in had been thrown in his face. His entire heart was quenched by the cold. He kneeled dumbly in place, not even blinking. Soundlessly, two teardrops rolled down his cheeks. This was the first time Luo Binghe cried since he buried his adoptive mother with his own hands, and it was also the last time he cried on Cang Qiong Mountain. Since then, no matter what wrongs he suffered, no matter what “Shen Qingqiu” did to him to vent his own twisted feelings, Luo Binghe never again let out unrestrained tears like he did that day. Shen Qingqiu crouched in front of him, but his sleeves passed right throughhe couldn’t touch, couldn’t hold, couldn’t even wipe his tears. His heart hurt for him; it was unbearable enough to drive him to death. Knowing very well that Luo Binghe couldn’t hear, he still said, “Come on, don’t cry.” Luo Binghe stared at his own knees, fists slowly tightening on his legs. The tears flowed faster and fiercer, dripping onto his lapel. Shen Qingqiu futilely attempted to wipe his cheeks, coaxing, “Shizun won’t hit you ever again. Don’t cry.” Luo Binghe raised his palm to rub his eyes. He picked up the teacup on the ground and set it to the side. Grasping the jade pendant over his heart, he straightened up into a proper kneeling posture. Shen Qingqiu knew the current motions of his heart. It must have been some rule he didn’t understand, something he did wrong to offend the Peak Lord, and he was educated for that reason. As a disciple, kneeling for Shizun should be expected. Seeing these tiny movements, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t resist turning to face him, kneeling down as well. Reaching out his arms, he held Luo Binghe’s oh-so-tiny body tightly in his incorporeal embrace. After closing his eyes to a field of darkness for some time, the next time he opened them was to snow-white bed curtains and tassels in the four corners occupying his field of view.Suddenly seeing a different scene, Shen Qingqiu hadn’t quite adjusted, not making a move up until Yue Qingyuan’s voice sounded from beside him. “You’re awake?” Shen Qingqiu mechanically blinked his eyes a few times. His throat a bit dry, he forced out, “Zhangmen-shixiong.” Yue Qingyuan sat by the bed. After looking at him for some time, he said, “You kept calling Luo Binghe’s name.” Shen Qingqiu: “En.” Yue Qingyuan: “Crying and calling.” Shen Qingqiu wiped his face. Aside from cold sweat, there really was some other liquid there. Sure enough, tears were an infectious sort of thing. “…” He said meekly, “Shixiong, I can explain.” Can explain what? What reason for the true story “Qing Jing Peak Lord cries and calls out his own disciple’s name in his dreams” would be sufficient for people to believe? Seeing him unable to come up with the words, Yue Qingyuan sighed and said, “Let it be. It’s good that you’re awake; you don’t need to explain.” Shen Qingqiu sat up, embarrassed. He suddenly realized that this scene was a bit familiar. The first time he had woken up in this world, it was also Yue Qingyuan keeping guard at his bedside. Yue Qingyuan observed his complexion and said, “You’ve been asleep for five days. Do you need to sleep some more?” Asleep for five days! Shen Qingqiu scarcely avoided toppling over again on the spot. System:Plot hole-filling event “Shen Jiu”: completion progress 70% He’d only completed 70%? Hold it, other than that 10% incomplete material from memories damaged beyond repair, what about the other 20%? Where did it go! He didn’t have time to ponder it that much. Shen Qingqiu grabbed Yue Qingyuan. “Sect Leader, the first day it snowed was at Luochuan!” Finding that he was excessively agitated and that his words were without coherence or order, he fixed his expression and began again with a calm and solemn tone. “What I meant was, it’s very likely that Tianlang-Jun will use Xin Mo to open a rupture and begin to merge the Two Realms at this time and this place.” Yue Qingyuan: “How do you know?” Shen Qingqiu was stuck again. Could he out and say it was because theoriginal work said that this time and this place was the most fitting one? Shen Qingqiu said, “I spent some time in Tianlang-Jun’s possession.” Yue Qingyuan: “So he just told you directly?” Shen Qingqiu couldn’t find an explanation on short notice. He could only harden his face and say, “Zhangmen-shixiong, please, I need you to trust me.” Yue Qingyuan looked at him for a while. Closing his eyes for a spell then standing up, he said warmly, “You rest first. This thing can be handed over to our other comrades to handle.” Rest. Do you mean sleep? I’ve already slept for five days! A core formation cultivator needing to sleep for so many daysonly in Proud Immortal Demon Way would this be taken as nothing out of the ordinary. If you switched for a different novel author, they would definitely be ridiculed until their own mother wouldn’t recognize them! Yue Qingyuan had just left when Shen Qingqiu rolled off the bed, looking all over for an outer robe. He turned this way and that, when a person took advantage of his distraction to sneak up behind him, a hand coming up to cover his eyes. Shen Qingqiu subconsciously struck out with an elbow, yelling, “Who is it!” A person with this much guts, who also likes playing this sort of senseless game with him, who else could it be? His elbow was firmly caught, a familiar voice saying by his ear, “Shizun, why don’t you guess?” He’d already opened his mouth to call him Shizun, the hell do you want him to guess? Shen Qingqiu rolled his eyes. The person behind him suddenly grasped his waist, rolling them both onto a bamboo couch at the side. The bamboo creaked under two people’s weight. The object covering his eyes shifted awayof course, it was Luo Binghe. His hand changed places to cover Shen Qingqiu’s mouth. “Don’t blink. Shizun’s eyelashes are so long, they’re making my hand itch, and my heart itches too.” You have long eyelashes; the one with the longest eyelashes is you! Shen Qingqiu blinked some dozen times in a row to express his fury. Luo Binghe smiled and leaned in to press a kiss on his eyelid. He said, “Don’t yell under any circumstance. If we’re discovered at Qing Jing Peak, Shizun’s clean reputation really will be wrecked at once.” What clean reputation do I have left? It’s all long been wrecked by this rebellious disciple.Luo Binghe kissed down the line of Shen Qingqiu’s eye. “I said I’d come to get you. We haven’t seen each other for so many daysdid Shizun miss me?” The correct response, in his mind’s eye, should be first a knee to the stomach to kick this degenerate disciple off the couch, then a graceful rearrangement of his appearance, and finally an elegant and aloof “No.” But for some reason, thinking of the Luo Binghe in the memory kneeling all alone in the bamboo house, silently picking the teacup up from the ground, he couldn’t bear to raise his leg. Shen Qingqiu began to breathe like he was trembling in Luo Binghe’s palms. He closed his eyes and nodded."
"洛冰河估计早就做好了被一脚踹下去的准备，完全没料到沈清秋真的会点头。 他当场就僵在沈清秋身上，表情凝固了。 沈清秋也才反应过来自己做了什么事、刚才那个点头意味着什么。他杀人灭口再羞愤自尽 的心都有了。 不不不不不不不是不是你想的那样的你听我解释！！！ 洛冰河却不给他这个机会 , 搂腰的手猛地收紧 , 声音沉了下去： “…… 真的想我？ ” 沈清秋给他勒得眉头一皱。洛冰河气息急促 , 追问不休： “ 真想？ ” 你捂着我嘴呢就算我想回答也没法回答啊！ 只能要么点头 , 要么摇头的意思？ 沈清秋一会点头一会儿摇头，胡搞一气。洛冰河急道： “ 到底想不想？ ” 见他又一副快哭了的表情，沈清秋实在没辙 , 认输了。 他生出一种莫名的悲壮之感，豁出老脸不要，又磨磨蹭蹭，点了一下头。 这一次，沈清秋看得真真切切。确认的那一瞬间，洛冰河的呼吸滞住了。 一点微弱的星火在他瞳孔里慢慢亮起 , 迅速以燎原之势席卷了这整张脸、整个人。 就在沈清秋以为他要喜极而泣的时候，洛冰河深深埋下头去，把脸搁在沈清秋颈窝里 , 捂 住沈清秋的手慢慢松开，然后，开始又碎又密地啄着他的嘴角。沈清秋好容易能喘口气， 齿缝间蹦出两个字： “…… 胡闹。 ” 洛冰河喃喃道： “ 我也好想、好想。没有一时一刻不在想 ……” 沈清秋提到胸间的一口气又慢慢泄了出来。 他死鱼一样躺在榻上，自暴自弃似的盯着竹舍上方屋顶，半晌，叹气道： “…… 那你为何 前几天又不去梦境中找为师。 ” 洛冰河又黑又湿润的眼睛盯着他道： “ 师尊不嫌我烦么。 ” 白天也缠，晚上梦里还缠，一天十二个时辰全都对着这张脸，当然烦！ 可一不小心，就被缠习惯了。现在洛冰河都趴他身上来了，沈清秋居然也觉得不是不可以 接受 …… 这是怎么回事，怎么回事！ 究竟是怎么走到这一步的。是不是有点过了！ 沈清秋干巴巴地道： “ 知道自己烦，还不收敛。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 反正师尊也不是第一次嫌弃我了，烦就烦吧。 ” 听他这么说，沈清秋忍不住有些心酸。 洛冰河究竟有多喜欢他啊。 即便是初入苍穹山的日子里，遭受了那样的对待，一旦沈清秋对他表露了一点善意，洛冰 河就把曾经受过的伤害忘得一干二净，毫不犹豫地将他放进了心底。 一颗玻璃心，就这样被沈清秋毫无知觉地打碎，再自己小媳妇样一点一点捡起来粘好，再 满怀期待小心翼翼地递过来，再被打碎、粘合 …… 洛冰河低声道： “ 师尊每次在苍穹山派都笑的那么开心。我还以为不怎么会想我。 ” 鬼扯。 沈仙师这么多年装 B 装成了习惯，尤其在苍穹山派，最多也只是含蓄而意味深长地似笑非 笑，或者皮笑肉不笑，再不就是敷衍了事的假笑，哪有 “ 开心大笑 ” 过。沈清秋： “ 胡说。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 诚然师尊脸上总不会笑得开怀。但师尊心里笑没笑，我当然是知道的。 ” 一边趴在人身上哼哼撒娇，一边捉着人一缕头发玩儿，你是小女生吗！ 沈清秋翻白眼道： “ 是。你是我肚子里的蛔虫。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 我不要做蛔虫。 ” 沈清秋拍蚊子一样拍他玩自己头发的手： “ 那你还想做什么！你倒是说说，为师、都对 谁、笑、过！ ” 说到后来，说几个字就拍一下，那只闲得发慌的手还挥之不去。洛冰河真 的开始数了： “ 很多人。柳 …… 柳师叔，岳掌门，尚清华，明帆，宁师姐，仙姝峰的，万 剑峰的，千草峰的，穹顶峰的，百战峰的，守山门的，扫山梯的 ……” 连守山门和扫山梯的都不放过，这孩子何止是记仇，整个苍穹山派都要被他的魔界进口特 浓飘香陈醋给淹了！ 沈清秋批评： “ 那声师叔叫得太没有诚意了。以后不许这么叫。 ” 洛冰河怨念道： “ 他管我叫小畜生白眼狼，那倒是诚意十足。 ” 沈清秋忍不住笑了出来。折扇就放在榻边，他顺手抓起来，在洛冰河脑门旁敲了敲： “ 他 说错了？你不是小畜生是什么？狼爪子都敢伸到我身上。 ” 话说得太顺溜，连他自己都没有觉察，这句有点没把持住度，语尾随嘴角上挑，似轻还重 ，略显轻佻，极不端庄。 洛冰河居高临下，把这幅情状看在眼里，只觉得一把无名火在心头腹部毛躁躁地乱烧，不 自觉动了动，把一条腿插【进沈清秋双膝之间，又怕被发觉后给踹下竹榻，忙把头送过去 ，让沈清秋拿着扇子敲个够，道： “ 就算是小畜生，也只是师尊一个人的小畜生。别人不 许叫。 ” 沈清秋险些没把折扇掰断。 肉麻。 太特么的肉麻了。 又酸又痒！又麻又爽！ 不行，不能再这样下去了。沈清秋决定谈点正事，把这种越来越诡异的气氛歪掉。 他用折扇戳戳洛冰河胸口，撑住： “ 起来。 ” 要谈正事，首先要端正坐姿。一个压一个的姿势，话题再怎么正经也会变得不正经。洛冰 河不大甘心，还是爬了起来，坐到榻边。 沈清秋睡了五天，老腰都睡断了，总算能直一直。他觉得自己是一副老头子愁眉苦脸捶腿 揉腰的模样，在别人眼里可不大一样。 发丝微乱，散于肩头，中衣领口歪斜，露出一段白皙的颈与肩，喉结和锁骨明晰。因为才 在榻上滚了一遭，脸颊涌上一层薄红，蹙眉不语，低头揉着后腰。 洛冰河眼睛一眨不眨，凑过来，慢慢帮着他揉。沈清秋满意地说： “ 乖。贴心。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 我更贴心的好处，师尊还不知道呢。 ” 好会邀宠。沈清秋正要切入正题，洛冰河继续说下去了： “ 和天琅君对上的时候，若是师 尊有什么需要帮忙的地方，尽管叫我。 ” 沈清秋一直避免触及天琅君的话题，防止刺激到洛冰河，真没想到，居然会是他主动提 起。 沈清秋琢磨了下，斟酌着道： “ 你父亲 ……” 洛冰河把头埋在他肩膀上，闷闷地说： “ 我没有父亲。只有师尊。 ” …… 怎么感觉我跟你爸一样了！ 沈清秋挥去这股感，认真地说： “ 若是勉强，千万不要逼自己。 ” 再怎么奇葩，好歹也是洛冰河他爹。好歹也是洛冰河曾经悄悄憧憬过的人物。虽然真人和 洛冰河脑补憧憬的相去甚远。 洛冰河手上动作不停，无所谓道： “ 不勉强。 ” 沈清秋仔细观察他。嗯，的确是一脸 …… 发自真心愿意帮忙围殴的正直表情。没有勉强的 痕迹。 这其实是件好事。如果洛冰河真愿意和修真界联手斥退天琅君，不但人界这边多了强悍的 助力，洛冰河也能顺便刷爆正面值，把昭华寺那里刷出的负值补救一下。 他稍微放下心，又觉着有点不厚道。 联合儿子去坑爹，是件不太厚道的事情。 沈清秋沉吟道： “ 掌门师兄可能不会让我出战。 ” 刚才岳清源走前说，让他好好休息， “ 这件事交给诸位同门便好 ” ，摆明是不要他参战的意 思。沈清秋道： “ 初雪之时，洛川。这个时间和地点，你最好留意一下。 ” 洛冰河捏着他腰的力道缓了下来，温声道： “ 有时候，我觉得，师尊对一些事真是了解得 过了头。 ” 咯噔一声，沈清秋的心打了个突。 是不是有点得意忘形了。 洛冰河继续道： “ 就像在圣陵那时。师尊分明从未进入过圣陵，却对其中墓室布局，守陵 魔物了如指掌，还能善加利用。 ” 沈清秋刻意轻描淡写道： “ 清静峰那么多典籍，并非一纸空文，连篇累牍，总有些可用之 处。 ” 洛冰河 “ 哦 ” 了一声，揉完了腰，开始用手慢慢梳理沈清秋散在背心的长发： “ 那些典籍弟 子也读了读，却没看见这么多。果然比起师尊还差得太远。 ” 擦。怎么能忘了，洛冰河还有逆天的学霸挂。清静峰上那堆灰扑扑的陈年老书，他说 “ 读 了读 ” ，意思就是 “ 已倒背如流 ” ，当然知道里面究竟有没有 “ 可用之处 ” 。 这孩子不是岳清源。他不想说，岳清源就不会追问，洛冰河却是绝对会死缠烂打刨根问底 ，没那么好忽悠。沈清秋正绞尽脑汁想该怎么把这一弯绕过去，忽然，竹舍外传来宁婴婴 的声音： “ 师尊，您是醒了吧？婴婴可以进来么？ ” 好孩子，真是乖徒弟！ 沈清秋低声道： “ 你先走。 ” 洛冰河的手顿了顿： “ 为什么是我走，不是他们走？ ” 明矾的声音也响了起来，他嚷嚷道： “ 师尊，几位师叔都来了，您方便起来吗？ ” 怎么一来就来这么多！ 沈清秋跳下榻，把洛冰河推到窗前。洛冰河边走边回头道： “ 原来师尊喜欢这样偷偷摸摸 ……” 沈清秋一折扇敲他脑门上去： “ 究竟是偷偷摸摸的是谁，是谁的错！ ” 为什么每次都非得弄得跟偷情似的不可！ 洛冰河身子无声无息翻出了窗，手又伸进来，握住沈清秋，柔声道： “ 师尊，等到这些事 情都平息之后，你要不要跟我走？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 为师还是清静峰峰主呢。 ” 洛冰河想见他的话，直接来找不就行了，为什么非 得跟他走不可？春山恨又要有新素材了！说到底，还是老脸拉不下来。 洛冰河叹息道： “ 我想也是这样。 ” 刚关上窗，竹舍竹门便开了。齐清萋人未到声先至，撩起帘子，露出一张明艳的面孔，努 嘴道： “ 真是越发娇贵了。你在昭华寺挨了几杖还是被打到吐血了啊？一睡能睡五天！ ” 沈清秋转身，半真半假道： “ 齐师妹别这样，我体弱你是一向知道的。 ” 齐清萋哼道： “ 你麻烦事多，我是一向知道的。 ” 她身后跟着柳溟烟，进屋后欠身失礼，再后面就是柳清歌。明帆和宁婴婴跟着木清芳走在 最后。不大不小的竹舍里，一下子挤满了人。沈清秋汗颜，幸好让洛冰河翻窗出去了，不 然这怎么藏得下去！ 木清芳笑道： “ 我就说沈师兄气色不错，并无异恙，真的只是在睡觉而已，这回你们该信 了我吧？ ” 沈清秋口中说惭愧，给众位峰主指了座位。见柳清歌进来后，一直在整个屋里扫视，目光 冽冽，道： “ 柳师弟，我在这里。 ” 柳清歌收回了目光，转向沈清秋，道： “ 刚才谁来过？ ”","CHAPTER 75: FLURRY ARRIVES ON GREEDY WINDS He reckoned that Luo Binghe had already prepared to be kicked off at once and did not entirely anticipate that Shen Qingqiu would actually nod. He went stiff on top of Shen Qingqiu on the spot, his expression freezing. Shen Qingqiu finally realized what he had just done and the meaning of that nod just now. He wanted to kill himself out of shame and even had the heart to kill someone to silence them. Nononononono it’s not what you think ━ let me explain! But, Luo Binghe didn’t give him this opportunity. The hand holding his waist suddenly tightened, his voice lowering. “You really missed me?” Shen Qingqiu’s brow creased. Luo Binghe, his breath harried, wouldn’t abandon this path of questioning. “You really did?” You’re covering my mouth. Even if I wanted to respond I can’t! Does this mean I can only either nod or shake my head? Shen Qingqiu nodded and shook his head in succession, messing around for a time. Luo Binghe pressed, “Did you miss me or not?” Seeing his expression like he was about to cry, Shen Qingqiu really didn’t have a way out ━ time to admit defeat. An ineffable tragic emotion stirring within him ━ time to sacrifice this old face ━ he slowly nodded again. This time, Shen Qingqiu could see full and clear. He could confirm that in that split second, Luo Binghe’s breath froze. A faint spark slowly ignited in his eyes, quickly engulfing his whole face, his whole body, growing with the force of a prairie fire. Just when Shen Qingqiu thought he would break down crying tears of joy, Luo Binghe lowered his head and buried his face deep in the crook of Shen Qingqiu’s neck. The hand covering his mouth slowly let go. And then, like a chick pecking at rice, he began to lay a broken and dense thicket of kisses on the corner of Shen Qingqiu’s mouth. Shen Qingqiu finally extricated himself to breathe, forcing three words through the gaps in his teeth. “Making a scene.” Luo Binghe muttered, “I also missed you a lot ━ a lot. There wasn’t a time, a moment when I wasn’t thinking of you…” The breath that was rising in Shen Qingqiu’s chest slowly drained backout. Laying flat on the couch like a dead fish, he stared at the roof of the bamboo house in despair. After a while, he sighed. “Then why didn’t you look for this teacher in the dreamscape these last few days?” Luo Binghe’s dark and moist eyes stared at him. “Shizun, don’t you think I’m annoying?” He’s sticky during the day, he’s sticky in dreams at night, twenty-four hours of the day and always looking at this face ━ of course, it’s annoying! But, in a moment without caution, he had gotten used to the stickiness. Now, Luo Binghe was lying right on top of him, and Shen Qingqiu didn’t even feel like it was something unbearable… How did it get to this stage? Isn’t this a bit excessive! Shen Qingqiu said dryly, “You know you’re annoying, and yet you still don’t restrain yourself.” Luo Binghe said, “Either way, this isn’t the first time Shizun turned his back on me. If he’s annoyed, then so be it.” Hearing him say this, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t resist feeling a bit sick at heart. How much does Luo Binghe like him after all? Even though he suffered that sort of treatment the days when he first entered Cang Qiong Mountain, as soon as Shen Qingqiu showed him a drop of kindness Luo Binghe swept away every injury he had suffered, clean and tidy. He put him in the bottom of his heart without the slightest hesitation. A glass heart had been shattered by Shen Qingqiu just like that, completely unaware. Like a young wife, he had picked up the pieces one by one by himself and stuck them back together to gently and carefully hand back over, heart full of expectation, only for it to be shattered again, stuck back together… Luo Binghe said softly, “Every time Shizun was on Cang Qiong Mountain with others, he smiled so happily. I thought you wouldn’t miss me very much.” Master Shen had spent so many years putting on a mask until it became habit, especially in Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. At most, it was a meaningful look, like a smile yet not. Or, it was a smile on the skin but not the flesh, making it impossible for others to guess his true thoughts underneath. Otherwise, it was a half-hearted performance of a fake smile. Since when did he “smile so happily”? Shen Qingqiu couldn’t accept it. “Nonsense.” Luo Binghe said, “Indeed, Shizun would never show an open-heartedsmile on his face. But whether or not Shizun was smiling in his heart, of course, I knew.” Lying on someone’s body and acting like a spoiled child while playing with a strand of their hair, are you a little schoolgirl! Shen Qingqiu rolled his eyes and said, “Yes. You’re the roundworm in my stomach.” Luo Binghe said, “I don’t want to be a roundworm.” Shen Qingqiu smacked the hand playing with his hair like he was swatting a mosquito. “Then, what do you want to do? Tell me, who did this teacher smile at before?” After finishing, he had hit him on every word, but that idle hand still wouldn’t be driven off. Luo Binghe actually began to count. “Many people. Liu… Liu-shishu, Sect Leader Yue, Shang Qinghua, Ming Fan, Ning-shijie, the people at Xian Shu Peak, Wan Jian Peak, Qian Cao Peak, Qiong Ding Peak, Bai Zhan Peak, the gate guards, the stair sweeps…” He wouldn’t even let off the gate guards and the stair sweeps ━ where would this kid stop his grudge? The whole of Cang Qiong Mountain would get swallowed by this special concentrated-flavor vinegar from the Demon Realm! Shen Qingqiu criticized, “The way you called Shishu was too insincere. From now on, don’t call him that.” Luo Binghe said resentfully, “When he calls me a little brute or a thankless wretch, he’s sincere enough.” Shen Qingqiu couldn’t resist laughing at that. His folding fan was sitting beside the couch, and he picked it up to give Luo Binghe a few taps on the head. “Was he wrong? You dare lay your wolf claws on this teacher’s body. If you’re not a little brute, then what?” The words were coming too smoothly, not even he himself realized that this was pushing the bounds of propriety. The tail end of his words lifted the corner of his mouth, seeming frivolous yet heavy, a bit coquettish, and extremely undignified. Luo Binghe looked down from above. When this scene entered his eyes, he only felt some sort of fire tickling its way up to burn wildly in his heart and stomach. He subconsciously moved to place a leg between Shen Qingqiu’s knees, but fearing getting kicked off the bamboo couch after discovery, he hurriedly moved his head over to let Shen Qingqiu hit him with his fan to his heart’s content. “Even if I am a little brute, then I am only Shizun’s little brute. Other people can’t call me that.”Hearing this, Shen Qingqiu felt like a liter of sour plum juice had been forcibly poured down his throat, sickening enough to make his hair stand on end. He almost snapped his fan in his grip. He hurriedly used it to jab Luo Binghe in the chest to prop him up. “Get up.” If they wanted to speak of official matters, they had to be sitting upright in a proper position. With one person on top of the other, no matter how serious the topic of conversation, it would turn indecent. Luo Binghe wasn’t quite willing but still climbed up to sit on one side of the couch. After sleeping for five days, Shen Qingqiu felt like his old waist was about to break, but at least he could still straighten. He thought he looked like some old man with pursed brows and pained face beating his legs and rubbing his back, but in others’ eyes it was a completely different scene: hair in disorder, loose over the shoulders; inner robe with collar askew, showing a strip of pale shoulder and neck, throat and collarbone clearly defined. Because he had just been rolling around on the couch, a pale layer of red was painted across his cheeks, silently frowning and rubbing his lower back. In this type of situation, errant hearts couldn’t help but stray further and further. Luo Binghe, not blinking a single blink, scooted closer, slowly helping him rub his back. Shen Qingqiu said, satisfied, “Good. Considerate.” Luo Binghe said, “Shizun still doesn’t know how considerate I can be 299 .” He really knows how to ask for pampering. Luo Binghe continued, “When facing Tianlang-Jun if Shizun needs my assistance at any point, don’t hesitate to call for me.” Shen Qingqiu had been avoiding the topic of Tianlang-Jun to keep from upsetting Luo Binghe. He never thought he would raise the topic himself ━ sure enough, it was a bit too considerate. He thought for a bit, then said deliberately, “Your father…” Luo Binghe buried his head in his shoulder, saying stuffily, “I don’t have a father. Only Shizun.” … Why do I feel like I’m your dad? Shen Qingqiu waved away this helpless feeling and said earnestly, “If you are reluctant, by all means, don’t force yourself.” No matter how much of an exotic flower he was, he was still Luo Binghe’s father. In any case, he was still a person Luo Binghe had once secretly longed to meet, even if in reality he was far from the image of Luo Binghe’s longings.The movements of Luo Binghe’s hand never stopped. He said indifferently, “I’m not reluctant.” Shen Qingqiu carefully examined him. En, sure enough, this face… was an honest expression of one who sincerely wished to help gang up on someone and beat them up. No traces of reluctance at all. Actually, this was a good thing. Though joining up with the son to entrap the father wasn’t a very upright path, if Luo Binghe truly wanted to join hands with the cultivation world to dethrone Tianlang-Jun, not only would the human realm gain a ferocious ally, Luo Binghe would also max out his righteousness points while he was at it. He would be able to remedy the losses he incurred at Zhao Hua Temple a bit. Before Yue Qingyuan had left just now, he had told him to rest well and that “This matter can be handed over to our other comrades to handle,” meaning that he didn’t want him to go to battle. Shen Qingqiu muttered, “Sect Leader- shixiong might not let me go to battle. When the snow begins to fall, Luochuan. It’s best if you be mindful of this time and this place.” Luo Binghe softened the grip on his waist, saying in a warm tone, “Sometimes, I feel Shizun really has an excessive understanding of some things.” Shen Qingqiu’s heart thumped in his chest. Luo Binghe continued, “Just like that time in the Holy Mausoleum. Shizun had clearly never entered the Holy Mausoleum before, but he knew the layout of the rooms inside and the demonic artifacts guarding the tombs like the back of his hand, and could even exploit them to his own advantage. It draws this disciple’s esteem and makes him sigh in admiration.” Shen Qingqiu deliberately traced out, “All those ancient books Qing Jing Peak has accumulated over the years are not worthless scraps of paper and verbose nonsense. There’s always useful information inside.” Luo Binghe let out an “Oh.” Done massaging his waist, he began to use his fingers to slowly comb out the long hair loose at Shen Qingqiu’s back. “This disciple has also read some of those ancient books but didn’t catch sight of this much. Sure enough, he is still too far from Shizun’s ability.” … How could he have forgotten? Luo Binghe also had a heaven-defying top student halo. If he said he’d “read some,” that means he already knows all of those dusty old books on Qing Jing Peak by heart. Of course, he’d know if there was any “useful information.” This child was not Yue Qingyuan. If he didn’t want to talk, Yue Qingyuanwouldn’t ask, but Luo Binghe would definitely pester him to death to get to the root of the issue. He wasn’t that easy to deceive. Shen Qingqiu was still racking his brains to figure out how to detour around this bend when, suddenly, Ning Yingying called from outside the bamboo house. “Shizun, you’re awake, right? Can Yingying come in?” Good kid, what an obedient disciple! Shen Qingqiu said quietly, “You go first.” Luo Binghe’s hands paused. “Why is it that I have to go and they don’t?” Ming Fan also called from outside. He yelled, “Shizun, a few of our shishu are already here. Is it convenient for you to get up?” Why did this many of them come at once! Shen Qingqiu jumped off the couch, pushing Luo Binghe out the window. Luo Binghe threw back while leaving, “So it turns out Shizun likes to sneak around like this…” Shen Qingqiu knocked him on the forehead with his fan. “Who’s the one being sneaky? Whose fault is it?” Why do you have to make it look like a secret love affair every time! Luo Binghe soundlessly flipped out the window but stretched his hand in again to grab Shen Qingqiu. He said softly, “Shizun, after these affairs have been settled, do you want to leave with me?” Shen Qingqiu couldn’t quite tear down his face and could only stay reserved. “This teacher is still the Qing Jing Peak Lord.” If Luo Binghe wants to see him, can’t he just come to find him? Why insist on leaving with him? He didn’t want to contribute any more source material for Resentment of Chunshan. Luo Binghe sighed. “I thought so.” He had just closed the window when the bamboo house’s door opened. Qi Qingqi’s voice arrived before her person did. Lifting the curtain to show her bright and beautiful face, she pouted, “You really are more and more pampered. At Zhao Hua Temple, were you struck a few times or beaten until you were spitting blood? You slept five days in one go!” Shen Qingqiu turned and said half-sincerely, “Don’t be like this Qi- shimei, you’ve always known about my debility.” Qi Qingqi snorted. “I’ve always known you’re inconvenient and troublesome.” Liu Mingyan followed behind her, bowing in greeting after entering. Behind her was Liu Qingge. Ming Fan and Ning Yingying followed Mu Qingfang at the very back. The modestly-sized bamboo house was crammed fullof people all at once. Shen Qingqiu began to sweat. Fortunately, Luo Binghe had left through the window, or else there’s no way he’d be able to hide now. Mu Qingfang smiled, “I was saying that Shen-shixiong’s complexion was normal, no unusual signs of sickness; he really was just sleeping. You should believe me this time, no?” Shen Qingqiu voiced his shame, pointing out seats for each Peak Lord. Seeing Liu Qingge sweep his eyes over every part of the room after he entered, his gaze cold, he said, “Liu-shidi, I’m over here.” Liu Qingge looked back, turning towards Shen Qingqiu. “Who was here just now?”"
"沈清秋特地再给他指了一次座，道： “ 掌门师兄刚走。 ” 他执起桌上茶壶，明帆连忙上来帮忙 , 被他示意不必插手。沈清秋亲自给众人斟完茶水 , 柳 清歌终于坐了下来 , 端起茶盏 , 喝一口，不说话了。 齐清萋道： “ 掌门师兄自然是来过的。柳师弟你摆那张脸，我还以为你说的是洛冰河。 ” 说者无心 , 听者有意。沈清秋一阵腮帮子疼，假笑道： “ 怎么可能。 ” 齐清萋把茶盏在桌上重重一搁，挑目道： “ 不错。那怎么可能。洛冰河这厮现在要是还敢 上苍穹山来，人人见他就是一剑！ ” 坐在一旁笼着袖子的木清芳随口道： “ 那也得刺得中他呀。 ” 沈清秋呵呵呵呵 , 齐清萋指他道： “ 笑 , 你还有脸笑。最闹人心的就是你！沈清秋我告诉你 , 好在你这次自觉跟着师兄师弟他们回来了。要是又像上次那样，二话不说就跟着他走 , 我 第一个清理门户 , 看你还能不能折腾！ ” 明明是关心告诫的话，非要说得这么泼辣，就差没跳起来揪沈清秋后脖子了。一屋子人围 着，看笑话的看笑话，喝茶的喝茶，嗑瓜子的嗑瓜子（为什么柳溟烟嗑瓜子面纱也不取下 来），沈清秋算是怕了她，连忙转移话题： “ 师兄怎样，上次受的伤好全了吧？ ” 木清芳道： “ 算是好了。 ” 他虽然说是 “ 好了 ” ，可分明是想要叹气的神色。齐清萋哼道： “ 要不是师兄不到万不得已 绝不拔剑，又是听闻异变，强行破关而出的，洛冰河别想从他手下讨到便宜。你要是再晚 出来一会儿，说不定就能瞧见师兄的玄肃出鞘了。 ” 这说的沈清秋也有些心痒。 要知道，无论在原著还是在这边，他都从没见识过玄肃出鞘是什么光景呢。好吧，这也是 向天打飞机的坑！ 雷声大雨点小，前面铺陈无数，到后面  没了！ 完全不交代一下，岳清源直接就万箭穿身，死了 [ 手动拜拜 ] 坑爹呢！ 宁婴婴自从进来后，一直低头站在旁边，沈清秋招呼她上来，问道： “ 怎么了？ ” 宁婴婴慢慢蹭上来，抬起脸蛋，一双眼睛红得跟小兔子似的，带着鼻音，嘟哝道： “ 师尊 ，你这次回来，就不要再走了，好不好。 ” 哭了。 又哭了。沈清秋傻眼。 怎么回事，他不是个泪腺发达的人，最多的是生理性泪水，为什么养大的徒弟个个动不动 都爱梨花带雨 …… 明帆触景生情，悲从中来，也一起干嚎： “ 师尊 ” 这个跟梨花带雨完全不沾边！ 齐清萋立刻逮到机会教训他： “ 看看！看看你徒弟，心疼不？你又不只是有一个徒弟！就 疼那一头白眼狼，别的还管不管了？ ” 沈清秋拍着宁婴婴的后背，边小小安慰她边辩解： “ 我什么时候只疼一个了？ ” 柳清歌把茶喝到剩三分之一，垂着眼睫道： “ 回来了，就留着。 ” 当然要留着。 苍穹山派这么好的组织，上了船就不能下来。沈清秋简洁地道： “ 嗯。 ” 听到他的回应，齐清萋满意至极。柳清歌刚要说点什么，忽然眉宇一凛，杀气横生。 屋内众人觉察到他气势变化，不约而同把手放上了佩剑。柳清歌霍然起身，瞬间闪身至窗 前，沈清秋一颗心高空抛物般吊起。 柳清歌猛地推开两扇格窗。 外边上方是疏星朗月，下方是竹林深深，空无一人。 洛冰河当然不会一直傻站着，肯定早走了。 屋内气氛迅速松懈下来。木清芳道： “ 柳师兄，你看什么呢？ ” 然而，柳清歌并未回身，而是伸出一手，仿佛在接住从天而落的什么东西。 半晌，他收回手，转身道： “ 下雪了。 ” 沈清秋睁着眼睛躺了一夜，第二日，一听到告警钟声，便冲出了竹舍。 这钟声一下比一下急，又重又急，回音震荡不止，在整个苍穹山之巅盘旋萦绕。 各峰弟子从虹桥通往清静峰集合，穹顶殿外人头攒动，却鸦雀无声。 沈清秋安置好清静峰的人，来到殿中。一面高逾丈的白晶石镜立在殿侧，除了安定峰来的 是一名代理事弟子，诸位峰主已经到齐，站在它之前，神色凝重。 镜中映照出的，是一条宽阔平坦的江流，两侧有绿山青田，还疏疏落落嵌着一排或几个白 色的屋顶。 岳清源道： “ 洛川中游，上空。 ” 在这派景象之上，一座黑压压、洞窟丛生、阴森诡谲的山岭从云丛中冒出头来。仿佛一个 坑坑洼洼的漆黑骷髅头，倒立着从滚滚乌云里爬出，空洞森然地俯瞰下方。 那就是魔界的埋骨岭。 岳清源道： “ 消息是说，从昨夜子时开始的。初时只见到一片乱石，没过一个时辰，就能 看清是一座山岭了。 ” 一位峰主惊道； “ 一个时辰未过？这 …… 也太快了！ ” 不。这是合并的正常速度。天琅君果然还是选择了原著所说的 “ 最佳时机地点 ” 行动。 不出意料，半天后，各地都会出现这种异像。两天之内，两界就能彻底合并。 就像撕碎两幅画，再把它们胡乱拼接成一幅。 柳清歌抱着手臂，乘鸾执在手中，道： “ 所以我们得更快。 ” 岳清源道： “ 各峰峰主抽取座下三分之二内门弟子随行。半个时辰内到达洛川中游。 ” 得掌门令，峰主们呼啦一下全散了。 半个时辰内到达，给他们准备的时间只有不到十分钟，自然要快。沈清秋也准备回去点人 ，岳清源却叫住了他： “ 你留在这里。 ” 果然。 沈清秋回头，道： “ 师兄，你知道我非去不可。 ” 岳清源神色肃然，道： “ 师弟，除了初雪、洛川，你还知道什么？ ” 沈清秋缓缓地说： “ 要截止合并，先要拔掉心魔剑。它就在埋骨岭颅骨之处插着，天琅君 一定在那里供给力量。 ” 意思就是，解决方法：①毁了心魔剑；②杀掉天琅君。 岳清源坚持道： “ 你留守。 ” 沈清秋正要说话，岳清源手起一诀，似乎是要开一个禁制，直接把他封在穹顶殿内。 掌门要来硬的了！ 沈清秋背脊紧绷，不知该不该把手放到修雅上。正在这时，殿外传来参差不齐的惊呼。 两人同时抢出殿外，顺着广场上弟子们手指的方向望去，沈清秋暗暗抽了一口冷气。 只见苍穹山上空中，浩瀚奔涌如怒海翻腾的云层泛起了血色。 一道道红光划破天际，一颗颗裹挟的火焰的巨石，仿佛烈焰流星，朝苍穹山直坠而来。 岳清源神色不变，诀随手起，玄肃连鞘带剑呼啸而出，将那数颗巨石击碎为齑粉。无数如 烟花爆炸后带有余温的小粒子散落。 火山口一般的红云里，隐隐能看到无数的人手和正在嘶号的人头，翻滚挣扎，痛苦万状， 犹如炼狱。 草！泥！马！的！无！间！深！渊！ 沈清秋心里咆哮不止：向天打飞机！ 你有本事写合并，你有本事写清楚苍穹山这个位置竟然是和无间深渊合并到一起的 啊！！！ 坑人呢这是  ！！！ 苍穹山真是抽中大奖了！！！ 苍穹山暂时不能留了。 这一波过后，不知什么时候还会有下一波来袭。不知道还要多久，就会和无间深渊合并到 一起，成为一片岩浆祸害，人间炼狱。 岳清源向那名安定峰的代理弟子道： “ 请昭华寺诸位大师前来助阵。 ” 他扬声道： “ 留守弟子听令，一旦结界破裂，不携一物，立即撤山！ ” 广场上千名弟子齐声道： “ 是！ ” 岳清源转头道： “ 清秋师弟，你也一起前往洛川。 ” 点完百战峰弟子的柳清歌折了回来： “ 那掌门你？ ” 岳清源道： “ 我先阻挡一阵，等昭华寺援手，随后就到。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 师兄你一个人撑得住吗？要不我留下来 ……” 柳清歌拽着他就走，言简意赅道 ：“ 走了。他说随后到，必然随后到。 ” 大祸临头，苍穹山派总算是有了作为一本修真小说第一大派的自觉，终于不再有车马舟船 慢悠悠走的闲情逸致了。 数千道飞剑风驰电掣从空中掠过，下方若有人仰头观望，就会看到一片流动的星河般的炫 目光阵。 这景象何其壮观。只可惜，空中那些冒出头来的诡异山石，会让人完全无心欣赏这种壮丽 又稀奇的奇观。 安定峰果然是后勤好一把手，效率奇高，估计昭华寺的布界援兵到的很快，撑住了结界， 岳清源也极快抽身，追了上来。 不到半个时辰，已至洛川中游。 因人数太多，不得不分区分批次着陆。洛川两侧早已挤满了得到消息、觉察异像，前来查 探的修真界人士，各门各派服色混杂。天一观的道人们正忙着疏散洛川旁的寻常百姓。无 妄与无尘领头，带着昭华寺一众前来汇合。 岳清源拱手道： “ 多谢诸位大师派来弟子解难。否则苍穹山派千百年基业，今日说不定便 要毁于一旦。 ” 无妄这和尚一向话多，今天却板着脸孔，一语不发。反倒是无尘大师抹了把汗，开口道： “ 阿弥陀佛。千百年基业险些毁于一旦的岂止是贵派，昭华寺也险些落入此种困境。 ” 岳清源微讶： “ 竟有此事？诸位大师将寺中百名布界弟子都派往了苍穹山 …… 可还有余力 护寺？ ” 沈清秋也疑惑。 昭华寺的觉悟莫非真的高到了宁可自身受损也要帮助别派的地步？ 无妄的脸色越发难看。 无尘大师见他还不说话，只好继续代言，道： “ 这 …… 实在是难以启齿。并非依靠自身余 力，而是借了旁人的鼎力相助。 ” 岳清源道： “ 莫非是天一观？ ” 天一观素来以闲散逍遥闻名，乃是最无组织无纪律的一个大派。于结界一行，基本没有建 树，如果真是靠了天一观的帮助才撑下来，这可令人称奇了。 无尘大师摇头道： “ 是幻花宫。 ” 沈清秋脱口而出： “ 幻花宫？那是 ……” 无妄铁青着脸道： “ 不错。正是洛冰河。 ” 忽然，一旁传来两声轻笑。 一个清凌凌又温文有礼的声音说： “ 鼎力相助，不敢当。若非要说，我只是为帮师尊罢 了。 ”","CHAPTER 76: RETURN TO THE ABYSS Shen Qingqiu pointed them again towards the seats, saying, “Our shixiong has just left.” As he lifted the teapot from the table, Ming Fan hurried over to help, only to be stopped by a sharp glance telling him not to intervene. As Shen Qingqiu personally poured tea for everyone, Liu Qingge finally sat down, reached for his teacup, and sipped quietly. Qi Qingqi spoke, “Naturally, our other shixiong has already come by. Liu- shidi, from that face of yours, I thought you were speaking of Luo Binghe.” While words themselves may have no deeper implications when spoken, a listener could easily twist their intentions. Shen Qingqiu’s cheeks were already sore as he faked another smile. “Now how could that be possible?” Qi Qingqi placed her teacup down on the table rather heavily and raised an eyebrow as she spoke. “Of course. How could that be indeed? If Luo Binghe dared to return to Cang Qiong Peak now, you’ll see just how we take care of scum like him!” Mu Qingfang, sitting off to the side with his hands in his sleeves, commented casually, “Well you’d have to be able to take care of him first.” Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but laugh a little at their expense. Qi Qingqi immediately pointed at him. “You’ve still got the guts to laugh. The most problematic one here is you! Shen Qingqiu, I’m telling you now: it’s a good thing you took responsibility and came back with our shixiong and shidi this time. If you left with Luo Binghe again, I’d personally take care of you and expel you from the sect! See if you’d even be able to stand afterward!” There were obviously supposed to be words of concern, but she was so harsh that it was surprising that she didn’t head straight over and seize Shen Qingqiu by the neck. Mu Qingfang replied. “Well, all is well now.” Although he said it was “all well,” he clearly wanted to sigh in exasperation. Qi Qingqi spoke, “If it weren’t for shixiong’s refusal to pull out his sword until absolutely necessary, and how he was forced to charge in with little information, Luo Binghe would never have been able to take advantage of him and escape. If you had been just a little later, you may have been able to witness our shixiong’s Xuan Su sword.” At those words, Shen Qingqiu felt his heart stutter. After all, he had never seen the Xuan Su sword in any scene, whether from the original book or over onthis side of things. He didn’t know what Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky was thinking either. Would it kill him to write it? All the hints of grandeur, like thunderous roars on a stormy sky without a single drop of rain. All that lengthy, elaborate build-up, and then at the very end, there was nothing but an empty black pit waiting! With no explanation whatsoever, Yue Qingyuan was just pierced through with a thousand arrows and fell over dead! (bye bye!) Ning Yingying had been sitting off to the side with her head down the entire time since she walked in. Shen Qingqiu waved her over and asked, “What’s wrong?” Ning Yingying came over slowly and looked up with two eyes that were as red as a little bunny’s. With a sniffle in her voice, she quietly spoke, “Shizun, now that you’re back, don’t leave anymore, okay?” And she was crying again. Shen Qingqiu was left dumbfounded. He wasn’t a man prone to cryingat most, they would be rather figurative tears, falling deep in his heart. So why were all his disciples so quick to start sobbing? Her tears fell like an unending storm of raindrops on her pretty, delicate cheeks. Her words seemed to resonate with Ming Fan as well as he cried along sorrowfully. “Shizun” That one was definitely not from the same delicate crying scene! Qi Qingqi didn’t let the opportunity to lecture him slide past. “Look! Look at your disciples. Don’t you care about them at all? You have more than the one disciple, but you only care for that one ingrate! Did you forget the rest of them?” Shen Qingqiu patted Ning Yingying gently on the back, comforting her while defending himself. “Since when have I cared only for the one?” Liu Qingge finished the remaining third of his tea, closed his eyes, and said, “Come back and stay. Don’t leave anymore.” Shen Qingqiu agreed succinctly. “Alright.” Hearing that, Qi Qingqi was finally satisfied. Liu Qingge was just about to speak again when he suddenly froze. Then a murderous aura overcame him. Everyone in the room noticed his sudden change in demeanor and grasped their swords without hesitation. Suddenly, Liu Qingge rose and dashed towards the windows. Shen Qingqiu felt his heart leap into his throat. Liu Qingge pushed open the windows. Outside, the sky was clear and the moon shone brightly. Below them were deep forests of bamboo. There wasn’t a single human figure in sight. Of course, Luo Binghe wouldn’t just stand there stupidlyhe probably lefta long time ago. The air inside the room finally seemed to relax a bit. Mu Qingfang spoke, “Liu-shixiong, what did you see?” Yet Liu Qingge didn’t turn around. Instead, he reached a hand out the window as if catching something floating from the skies. After a while, he brought his hand back in and turned towards them as he replied, “It’s snowing.” Shen Qingqiu lay in his bed with his eyes wide open that entire night. On the next day, as soon as he heard the alarm bells, he rushed out of his bamboo house. The ringing of the bells seemed to grow more urgent by the second, every toll landing deep and heavy as it echoed throughout Cang Qiong Peak. The disciples from each peak gathered, from the Rainbow Bridge to Qing Jing Peak. All flocked and gathered outside Qiong Ding Palace, yet even in the crowd, all were completely silent. Shen Qingqiu settled things quickly on Cang Qiong Peak before heading for the palace. On one side of the palace was a tall white crystal mirror that stood over ten feet high 300 . Other than An Ding Peak’s stand-in disciple, all the other Peak Lords had gathered here, standing forwards in a picture of dignified grace. Reflected in the mirror was a wide, flowing river surrounded by tall mountains, green fields, and a few sparse rows of white roofs. Yue Qingyuan said, “The middle reaches of the Luochuan River. Look to the sky.” Above the scene, an ominous darkness was gatheringblack, cavernous mountains began to rise from behind the rolling clouds. It looked almost like a massive inverted, pitted skull, as it began creeping out of the dark clouds, the empty holes staring down upon the world below. That was the demonic Maigu Mountains. Yue Qingyuan spoke. “We received news that this began last night. At first, only a few scattered boulders appeared. But within the hour, it became clear that they were forming mountains.” One of the peak lords was shocked and exclaimed, “Within an hour? This… it’s much too fast!” No. This was a perfectly normal speed of merging. Tianlang-Jun really did choose the “best place” after all, just as he had said. Without interference, scenes like this one would be visible across within the day. Within the next two days, the two worlds would be fully merged ━ just like shredding apart two beautiful paintings, then stitching the pieces together into a blotchy, muddled new picture.Liu Qingge crossed his arms as he stood, holding the Cheng Luan sword in his grasp. “Then we need to move faster.” Yue Qingyuan spoke. “Each Peak Lord will bring two-thirds of the disciples from their peak with them. We will arrive at the midpoint of the Luochuan River within half an hour.” At the Sect Leader’s command, the Peak Lords immediately scattered. Arriving in half an hour would give them each less than ten minutes to prepare, so they had to move quickly. Shen Qingqiu was also preparing to head back to gather his own men when Yue Qingyuan called out to stop him. “You will stay here.” Shen Qingqiu turned around. “Shixiong, you know that I must go.” Yue Qingyuan replied, “Shidi, other than the first snowfall and Luochuan River, what else do you know?” Shen Qingqiu slowly replied, “In order to stop the merger, we must first pull out the Heart Devil Sword. It currently stands in a skull in the Maigu Mountains, and Tianlang-Jun must be there as well to feed strength into it.” Meaning the solution was: 1) Destroy the Heart Devil Sword, 2) Kill Tianlang-Jun Yue Qingyuan insisted, “You will stay behind.” Shen Qingqiu was just about to speak again when Yue Qingyuan raised his hand in a sealing motion, as if he was about to cast a barrier to lock Shen Qingqiu directly inside the Qiong Ding Palace. The Sect Leader’s about to lay down the law! Shen Qingqiu straightened, his back going completely rigid as he tried to decide whether he should reach for his Xiu Ya Sword. Right at that moment, a frayed voice cried out in alarm from outside the palace. Both men dashed out immediately and looked to the direction that the disciples outside were pointing towards. Shen Qingqiu gasped quietly under his breath. They could only watch as the clouds rolled in like massive tides in the vast sea of sky above Cang Qiong Peak, a bleeding red color. A beam of red light cut through the sky and colossal, flaming boulders began to appear one by one like meteors falling straight towards Cang Qiong Peak. Yue Qingyuan’s expression didn’t waver. He held out his hand and whistled; Xuan Su ━ sword, scabbard, and all ━ flew immediately into his outstretched hand. Shen Qingqiu watched as each boulder was crushed into tiny particles, like thousands of glowing embers floating down after an explosion of fireworks lit up the sky.The red clouds swirled about a massive crater, like the top of an erupting volcano. Within, they could see countless pairs of arms and screaming human heads, rolling about in pain, as if trapped in purgatory. Fuck, the Endless AbyssCang Qiong Peak sure drew the grand prize on this one! In his mind, Shen Qingqiu cursed relentlessly: goddamn Airplane Shooting Towards The Sky! If you were going to write a merger, you could’ve at least stated clearly somewhere that Cang Qiong Peak was located in the same location as the Endless Abyss! After this tide rolled past them, they didn’t know when the next wave would be coming in. They didn’t know how long it would be until the Twelve Peaks were completely merged with the Endless Abyss, becoming a sea of fire and lava, a hell on earth. Cang Qiong Peak couldn’t be saved now. Yue Qingyuan turned to the stand-in disciple of An Ding Peak. “Please call for aid from the masters of Zhao Hua Temple.” Then he turned and raised his voice. “All disciples remaining here, you are to follow your orders. As soon as the boundary is broken, leave all belongings behind and immediately retreat from the mountain!” All the disciples gathered in the square before them answered at once. “Understood!” Yue Qingyuan turned and said, “Qingqiu-shidi, you will also go to Luochuan.” Liu Qingge, who had returned after gathering his disciples from Bai Zhan Peak, said, “Then what about you, Sect Master?” Yue Qingyuan replied, “I will hold this back for as long as I can until the master of Zhao Hua arrives. Then I will join you.” Shen Qingqiu spoke, “Sect Leader-shixiong, will you be alright alone? How about I stay here…” Yue Qingyuan actually laughed a bit at that. “I tell you to stay, and you want to go. I tell you to go, and now you want to stay. Little… shidi, what will I do with you?” Liu Qingge pulled him along and started to leave, and spoke tersely. “Time to leave. If he says he will join us later, then he will join us later.” Finally, in the face of disaster, Cang Qiong Peak had the self-respect expected of the top sect in a cultivation novel. There were no more leisurely carriages or boats rolling casually along. Thousands of swords flew across theskies faster than a flash of lightning. If anyone below glanced up, they would only see streaks of light speeding past, like a moving stream of stars. How spectacular that scene must be. It was a pity that the menacing mountains appearing on the horizon took away any possible awe such a magnificent sight would bring. An Ding Peak really was the master of logistics, and they were extremely efficient. Support from Zhao Hua Temple arrived very quickly and helped support the boundary. Yue Qingyuan quickly left and caught up with them. Not half an hour later, he arrived at the middle reaches of the Luochuan River. Because there were so many of them, they were forced to land in groups, a few at a time. Both banks of the Luochuan River were already crowded with people: those who heard of it through passing news, those gifted with extraordinary visions, and cultivators from all clans and sects who had arrived to investigate, donning uniforms of every color. The cultivators were all busy evacuating the civilians from the area. Wu Wang and Wu Chen led a group from the Zhao Hua Temple over to join them. Yue Qingyuan joined his hands together in a bow. “My deepest gratitude to you, Masters, for sending your disciples to aid us. Otherwise, I fear the thousand years of history that stand behind the Cang Qiong Peak would have been destroyed in an instant.” Wu Wang was a monk that usually had plenty to say, yet today his face remained grave and he didn’t speak a single word. In fact, it was the Great Master Wu Chen who finally replied after wiping the sweat from his brow. “Amitabha. The thousand years of history that were about to destroyed were not only your own Zhao Hua Temple was nearly caught in the same devastating dilemma.” Yue Qingyuan was slightly surprised. “Such a thing was happening? Masters, you have sent hundreds of disciples out to Cang Qiong Peak ━ are there enough remaining to protect the temple?” Shen Qingqiu was also confused. Was it possible that the Zhao Hua Temple had reached the point of sacrificing even their own wellbeing for the sake of aiding other sects? Wu Wang’s face continued growing paler, and the Great Master Wu Chen, seeing his continued silence, could only reply and explain. “This… it’s really too difficult to speak of. It was not our own strength that saved us, but rather that which we borrowed from another who lent us their aid.” Yue Qingyuan asked curiously, “Could it have been Tian Yi Monastery?”Tian Yi Monastery had always been known for being unfettered and leisurely, a sect with little organization or discipline. They just went with the flow and made little contribution of their own. If they were the ones who managed to support the temple, it would be quick a shock. The Great Master Wu Chen shook his head. “It was the Huan Hua Palace.” Shen Qingqiu’s fan froze as the words slipped from his tongue. “Huan Hua Palace? Isn’t that…“ Wu Wang’s face was completely ashen as he spoke. “Correct. It was indeed Luo Binghe.” Suddenly, they heard two small sounds of chortling laughter from the side. A light, clear voice spoke in a perfectly mannered tone. “This one wouldn’t dare accept any gratitude for that which we have provided. If anything must be said of the matter, I was only trying to help Shizun.”"

Whether or not they were in close proximity, all of them now turned towards Shen Qingqiu; hundreds of pairs of eyes, with varying gazes, enveloped him from all directions. Spreading open his fan, Shen Qingqiu silently hid the lower half of his face behind it. Luo Binghe sauntered in, the hem of his black outfit fluttering as a breeze wafted across; the sword suspended on his waist was surprisingly Zheng Yang 301 . Behind him, Mobei-Jun was on the left with his head held high, while Sha Hualing sashayed seductively on the right. Huan Hua disciples, who have long been missing in action, trailed closely behind them. Bringing up the rear was a small army of black-armored infantry made up of demons. Shang Qinghua muddled along in the middle, weaving in and out, back and forth, like a slippery loach; this was an extremely incongruous sight to behold. Both of them stared daggers at one another the moment they came face to face with each other, sending knives and swords back and forth with their glares; how boisterous! Luo Binghe crossed over in an imposing manner and took his stand as the third party of the trio; the colorful expressions that appeared on everyone’s face were more than enough to make an emoji pack. Especially those from Cang Qiong Mountain, there was a period of time when they would fight those from Huan Hua Palace whenever they crossed paths with them; even now, their anger still felt particularly raw upon seeing this old enemy of theirs. Yet, the words of Zhao Hua Temple plainly suggested that they were allies at present and not foes, so they could only endure it and restrain themselves. Qi Qingqi warily asked, “Is what both masters said for real?” Luo Binghe smiled, “Is Peak Lord Qi suspecting that Zhao Hua Temple has also been… ah, brainwashed and oppressed by me?” Seeing that they were going to get into an argument again, Shen Qingqiu hurriedly said, “The words of Great Master Wu Chen are naturally true.” Hearing his words, the hundreds of eyes that were originally looking away from him seemed to have been triggered, and once again they all turned towards him. Qi Qingqi glared at him, looking at him as if Shen Qingqiu was a wayward and unfilial daughter siding with her husband instead of her parents 302 . Luo Binghe’s eyes were fixed on him. It was as if he could see no one else but Shen Qingqiu. He said, “Shizun, after not seeing you for so many days, thisdisciple missed you very much.” Didn’t they just meet last night… If someone else had said “missed you very much,” everyone here would have been covered in goosebumps. But it happened that Luo Binghe’s physical attributes and settings had been configured in a way such that “no matter what he said, others would not feel out of sorts,” thus everyone’s attention did not shift to him. Shen Qingqiu could feel the unfeeling gazes from everyone around him, so he could only reply with what he thought was an appropriate “mhm.” There was still a trace of a smile at the corners of Luo Binghe’s mouth. He continued, “The Northern and Southern demon territories have always been at odds with one another. The Northern Territory, of which I’m the leader, does not approve of the merge. We are thus willing to assist and join forces with all of you to fend off the enemy.” Standing with his hands at his back, Luo Binghe looked like a model human being. Who would know that behind the scenes, he was like a young girl who loved to lean on others while crying and acting like a pampered child… Who would believe it? Yue Qingyuan calmly said, “Forgive me for being suspicious. We parted on bad terms the last time at Zhao Hua Temple. And now Palace Master Luo suddenly wants to join forces with the cultivation world to fight off your biological father…” Luo Binghe replied succinctly, “I’m only doing this for one person. I don’t care about anything else.” This time, he did not say for whom, but was there any difference? Was there any point? In the snowy winter, Shen Qingqiu shook and turned the folding fan which he had used as a prop for posing like a cultured gentleman into a cattail leaf fan, wishing he could sweep away the various gazes directed at him to the nine heavens with a wave of his fan. One of the sect masters said with a dry laugh, “Peak Lord Shen has trained a good disciple. It’s indeed a great blessing for the cultivation world.” Although he said “trained a good disciple,” his tone was no different from saying “married a good husband.” Upon hearing it, Shen Qingqiu’s fanning movements started to carry an undercurrent of murderous intent. Wu Wang looked as if he wanted to smash these two  people who corrupt public morals  to death with his staff. Great Master Wu Chen hurriedly said, “Since Benefactor 303 Luo is willing to help, that’d be the best. I would also like to askSect Master Yue to take charge of the whole operation.” The various sects had always considered Yue Qingyuan to be the pillar of strength during critical moments. This time was no different; he naturally began to deploy and give instructions to the various sects, “Zhao Hua Temple, please arrange for the rest of the manpower to keep the barrier up. Stop Maigu Ridge from falling further. You must prevent it from connecting with the river.” Great Master Wu Chen looked awkward as he said, “We will do our best. However, Luo River is broad, and its two banks are far apart. There is no place to land, and the foundation is unstable; it is not suitable to set up an array there.” Yue Qingyuan thought for a moment and said, “How about sending a Cang Qiong disciple to ride a sword to set up and maintain the array in the air?” Luo Binghe suddenly piped up, “There’s no need to go to so much trouble.” He turned his head aside but said nothing. Mobei-Jun spontaneously stepped out, marched to the river, and stepped onto the surface of the water. Solid ice rapidly spread wherever he walked. It did not take long for the body of waters to be frozen by three feet. Even so, it continued to expand until even the swimming fishes were frozen in ice. With just a little more time, he would be able to freeze the entire middle stretch of Luo River. The output advantage that Demons had over humans was innate. There were exclamations of marvel, as well as chagrin, all around. Wu Chen said his thanks. With no trace of arrogance, Luo Binghe looked back at Shen Qingqiu with bright, shiny eyes. Shen Qingqiu saw that he had scored a lot of brownie points, and the hostility and wariness that everyone had towards him were no longer as bad. He could not help but feel gratified and said, “Mhm. Well done. “ A wide smile spread across Luo Binghe’s face. Somehow, the corners of Shen Qingqiu’s mouth lifted too. As soon as Shen Qingqiu noticed it, he immediately pulled the corners of his mouth down and composed himself. He wondered if it was not only tears that were contagious but even smiles too. Yue Qingyuan continued to assign tasks. Tian Yi Monastery would continue to spread out to other places beside Luo River where signs of the merge had begun to show and protect and evacuate the commoners in those places. Next up was Cang Qiong Mountain. Yue Qingyuan thought for a moment and said, “When the first wave of demons from Nan Jiang break through the barrier, Bai Zhan Peak will take the lead.” There were only forty people from Bai Zhan Peak, and someone could nothelp but ask, “Most of the demons from Nan Jiang are beasts, each of them formidable. Can forty people really resist the first wave of attacks?” How dare they doubt the battle capability of the combat clan! Liu Qingge stepped on the rocks with his foot. The tassel of his sword fluttered in the wind along with his white sleeves and black hair. Instead of answering directly, he said coldly to the disciples behind him, “Those who do not kill at least a thousand, scram on your own to An Ding Peak.” Forty people shouted in unison, “Yes!” Shang Qinghua muttered weakly: “Don’t discriminate against An Ding Peak…” Logistics is innocent, long live logistics! Yue Qingyuan continued to entrust tasks to Qiong Ding Peak, Xian Shu Peak, Qian Cao Peak… Each in their own positions, with their own duties. Shen Qingqiu saw that Luo Binghe was too laid-back and could not help but ask, “How many people have you brought with you? Don’t you need to make arrangements?” As soon as he opened his mouth, he felt countless ears pricked up and listened intently with bated breath. Even the whispers abruptly quietened down. The lithe Taoist nun triplets nearby let out a snicker. Luo Binghe replied, “I’ve brought everyone I could. The arrangement is simple.” Saying so, he pointed to Sha Hualing and Mobei-Jun who were standing behind him. “Entrust Jiuzhong-Jun to her. Entrust the ugly beasts to him.” Wasn’t that pitting the daughter against her father again? That was simply… Shen Qingqiu probed, “And?” Luo Binghe nodded solemnly, “And”a smile spread on his face “entrust Shizun to me.” The place erupted with coughs all around. Shen Qingqiu could barely maintain his composure. He snapped the folding fan shut and gripped it in his hand. Adjusting his expression, he said in all seriousness, “I have something to say to the former An Ding Peak Lord. For the time being, discuss with the various sect leaders on a plan to deal with the enemy.” Without caring about the reactions of others, he ran the moment he was done talking. He grabbed Shang Qinghua and dragged him as if dragging a dead boar to underneath a tree that was slightly isolated from the others. Shen Qingqiu said, “Why are you still alive? You should have died eighthundred chapters earlier. Why hasn’t Mobei-Jun offed you yet?” Shang Qinghua adjusted his collar: “Shen Da Da 304 , you should have died earlier than me. Now you are still alive and kicking. Aren’t you ashamed to talk about me?” Shen Qingqiu held his forehead and took a deep breath, “Brother Towards the Sky, Hero, Hero Airplane, do you lack love? So the original background for Shen Qingqiu you initially mentioned was that he was abused by a pervert in his childhood? Do you like to write bitter and tragic background stories that much?” Shang Qinghua replied, “The more tragic the character, the higher the popularity.” Shen Qingqiu said, “Bullshit! After getting spammed with two threads of reader comments braying for my castration, you’re telling me this is popularity?” “That was because I didn’t stick to the original settings.” Shang Qinghua put forth his argument and reasoned with him, “Bing-ge 305 , tragic or not? Popularity, high or not?” He still dared to use Luo Binghe as an example! Shen Qingqiu smacked him with his fan and asked, “Do you really like to make use of this point that much?” He thought of a miserable Luo Binghe kneeling on the ground to pick up broken teacups. Of his small and thin body straining to carry two buckets of water up and down the mountain steps. Of him huddled in the corner of the woodshed shivering uncontrollably at night. He felt so flustered and perturbed at those recollections he had the urge to hit someone, and this someone must be Airplane Shooting Towards The Sky! Shang Qinghua observed his face and said in astonishment, “What expression is that? Don’t tell me your heart aches for him? Damn, I always thought you were tenacious, unyielding, and would always hold your ground. I always thought you were straight!” Shen Qingqiu kicked him. “I don’t have time for your nonsense. Out with it, how do we fight Tianlang-Jun!” Shang Qinghua felt sorry for Tianlang-Jun and said, “Don’t fight him! Don’t you feel he has suffered enough? And to be honest, I can’t think of how to fight him myself, since the outline and details have not been worked out yet.” Shen Qingqiu said, “If we don’t defeat him, the ones who will suffer will be you and me. If you can’t think, then think of a way now. You are the one who established the foundation of this world; your thoughts themselves are the fabric of the story!”He had yet to finish speaking when they heard Luo Binghe’s voice, “Shizun, are you done with the discussion? It’s almost time to set out.” It was not even five minutes. Shen Qingqiu turned around quickly and said, “Set out?” Luo Binghe said: “Sect Master Yue and I think it’s best to send ten people to seize the sword. Shizun, are you going? I’ll go if you’re going.” Shen Qingqiu replied, “All right.” After a pause, he pointed to Shang Qinghua: “Take him, too.” The colors drained from Shang Qinghua’s face, and his eyebrows twitched. He yelled for Cucumber Bro to spare his life, but Shen Qingqiu had already swaggered away. Liu Qingge and Bai Zhan Peak were responsible for staying behind to guard the surface of the ice. Shen Qingqiu walked past him, then suddenly turned back and said half in jest, “Since you want your disciples to kill a thousand, then, Shidi, you must personally kill ten thousand to set an example.” Liu Qingge scoffed and said, “I’ll kill whoever dares to come.” Shen Qingqiu asked, “You feel reassured this time?” Liu Qingge thought for a moment and reluctantly said, “Sect Master- shixiong is around.” Luo Binghe tugged at the corner of Shen Qingqiu’s robe and said, “Shizun, take me flying.” Shen Qingqiu looked down at his waist, “Don’t you have a sword?” Faced with Shen Qingqiu alone, Luo Binghe was now no longer the overbearing and arrogant man. He said bashfully, “Recently, I’ve been using too much demonic energy and too few spiritual energy. I’ve kind of forgotten how to use it.” The other ten people nearby were looking at them. Shen Qingqiu did not want to delay, and thus he casually said, “Come on up!” They rode the sword high into the sky and landed as soon as they entered Maigu Ridge. So Luo Binghe did not really embrace him for long. The place they landed at was a rough patch of rock, with dried skeletons and bones growing out of the crevices between the dense white stones. Looking up, strange dark trees towered above them, intertwined with one another. The peculiar cries of some unknown monster, combined with the caws of crows, reverberated through the ridge. It should take them some time to search the ridge before finding Xin Mo sword. Shen Qingqiu warned, “There are many monsters in Maigu Ridge. It’sbetter not to touch anything that looks alive.” Luo Binghe was of the demonic tribe. To show his sincerity for their cooperation, he took the lead this time. Shen Qingqiu walked beside him. As they walked, Luo Binghe quietly reached his hand out to hold Shen Qingqiu’s hand. Wu Wang gave a loud cough, while Wu Chen said “Amitabha.” Yue Qingyuan simply and calmly shifted his gaze away. Shen Qingqiu’s breath caught. His forehead, cheeks, neck, and earlobes all felt as if they were burning. He was flustered, and, for no reason, felt like someone with a guilty conscience. He slowly withdrew his hand. The instant his palm turned up empty, Luo Binghe’s eyes looked as if they were instantly transformed into a wilderness blanketed with freezing snow. It was not long before he let out a laugh, lowered his voice and said, “What are you afraid of? They have a favor to ask of me; they will not dare to say anything.”"
"沈清秋低声说： “ 不是这个问题。 ” 洛冰河不依： “ 那是什么问题？ ” 沈清秋竖起折扇： “ 先解决眼下之事 , 之后再说。 ” 洛冰河慢慢退开 , 微笑： “ 好。 ” 他轻轻地道： “…… 反正有的是再说的时间。 ” 众人都能觉察到 , 四周阴阴簇簇的枝叶、及腰高的草丛，以及惨白的乱石堆缝隙间 , 潜藏着 无数蠢蠢欲动的生物。莹绿的眼睛和呼呼的低哮，如同微小的细浪，此起彼伏。

这山洞洞口掩映着层层厚重的绿叶，阴阴的甚是森然，站在洞口边，一阵寒凉。 众人都停住了脚步，迟疑着。 按照原先的设想，在到达这里之前，应当先杀他个敌将八百，斩他个魔物一千，顺便什么 毒虫奇花都要过上一通，才能千辛万苦来到最后关卡。 就算没这么多道程序，衣服起码要沾点血才对得起 boss 战吧？！ 一位掌门道： “ 恐怕不能贸然行动。 ” 另一位赞同道： “ 最好先探一探虚实。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 那是一定。 ” 他刚说完，漠北君就一脚把尚清华踹了出去。 真的是踹了出去 …… 了出去 …… 出去 …… 去 …… 在沈清秋震惊万分的目光中，尚清华连滚带摔就飞进了山洞， “ 探一探虚实 ” 去了。 死寂半晌，突然，洞中爆发出一声惨叫： “ 我擦啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！ ” 沈清秋以迅雷不及掩耳之速抓了一把藤叶，随众人涌入洞中，就听一个声音传来： “ 沈峰 主，又见面啦。 ” 心魔剑插在山洞尽头的岩缝之间。那黑气紫烟便是从它剑锋上溢出的。 天琅君坐在一块青石之上，尚清华就站在那块青石前不远处。 洞外的天光投射进来，照亮了天琅君半边身体。登时有人倒抽一口冷气。 沈清秋总算知道尚清华刚才为什么叫那么惨了。 天琅君虽然面上笑容不改，却因为小半张右脸尽皆成了腐烂的紫黑色，显得这笑容极其恐 怖。 他左边袖子空荡荡的瘪着。看来，那条总是掉下来的手臂，再也接不回去了。 这幅破破烂烂、油尽灯枯的模样，可跟沈清秋想象中的最终 boss 不太一样。 沈清秋忍不住留意洛冰河神色。只见他脸上是接近于木然的平静，不知道是什么滋味。 天琅君侧了侧头，道： “ 来的比我想象的要少。我还以为，会像上次白露山那样，数百名 高手齐上阵呢。 ” 无妄哼道： “ 你看看你这副人不人、鬼不鬼模样，身边一个喽都没有，还用得着那么多 人来吗？ ” 天琅君道： “ 喽？我这里的确没有，不过外甥倒有一个。 ” 话音未落，洞中闪过一道青影。竹枝郎无声无息挡在了天琅君侧前方。 不知为什么，这一对主从，都是一身狼狈。天琅君的露芝躯不适应魔气，被腐蚀得坑坑洼 洼，这可以理解。竹枝郎竟也瞳孔泛黄，脖子、脸颊、额头，手臂，凡 □□ 在外的地方， 都爬着一块一块的鳞片，狰狞可怖，看上去和露芝洞里的半人半蛇形态十分接近。 他哑声道： “ 沈仙师。 ” 沈清秋： “…… 是我。你怎么变成这样了？ ” 岳清源不动声色： “ 师弟，你和这位又有何渊源？ ” 渊源深了去了。走到今天这一步，跟这位有着莫大的关系。沈清秋正想说话，天琅君微微 一扬下巴，对岳清源眯眼道： “ 我记得你。 ” 他想了想，确定地说： “ 当时幻花宫那老儿要你助他偷袭，你没理会。如今苍穹山派的掌 门是你？不错。 ” 岳清源道： “ 阁下记性倒是好得很。 ” 天琅君笑着笑着，叹了口气。 “ 如果你们也被压在一个黑黢黢的地方十几年，不见天日，每天只能想些过往之事虚度光 阴，也会像我一样记性好。 ” 这次没人答他的话了。岳清源握住玄肃，连鞘带剑打了出去。 天琅君堪堪避过，轰隆阵阵，他身后洞壁被生生轰塌了半边，开了一个大洞，外面便是高 空，飞沙滚石跌落，向下方坠去。寒气霍的流卷而入，细碎的雪花漫空飞舞，迷人视线。 百丈之下的冰面上，隐隐传来一浪高过一浪的兽鸣和厮杀声。 第一波南疆魔族已经落地了。 天琅君道： “ 我猜，一定又是百战峰打头阵。对不对？ ” 数十人分散开来，从各个角度抄了过去。无妄法杖挥得虎虎生风，刚猛十足，抢攻在最 前。竹枝郎被玄肃逼得节节败退，却仍尽职尽责地吸引着大部分的火力。天琅君继续坐在 青石上，清闲得很，道： “ 当年我便记得，你拖到最后一刻才拔剑。今天也要这样？ ” 岳清源不答话，正要一掌击上竹枝郎胸口，另一名掌门抢先打了上去。竹枝郎不避不退， 生生受了这一击，可发出惨叫的却是那名掌门。 沈清秋瞳孔骤缩，喝道： “ 别碰他！他身上都是毒！ ” 混战之中，几人中毒，几人被爆炸的魔气灵力震出洞外，身体飞入半空，下坠的途中翻上 了飞剑，才稳住身形。尚清华偷偷摸摸往沈清秋那边溜，竹枝郎正战得血气翻腾，蓦地见 一个鬼鬼祟祟的身影往外蹭，不假思索甩了两条青蛇过去。沈清秋看得清楚，反手一翻， 一枚青叶正要飞出，挽救作者菊苣的生命，两条青蛇被倏然生出的冰剑穿刺而过。 漠北君鬼影般出现在战圈之中，拎起尚清华，扔小鸡一样扔到沈清秋那边，一拳砸向竹枝 郎。 接下来的十秒内，沈清秋算是见识了什么叫做 “ 暴打 ”…… 竹枝郎这边被漠北君狂殴不止，围攻天琅君的火力陡然加大。 天琅君虽没了一只手，以一对多，风度仍分毫不乱，笑道： “ 其实我本来没合并两界的意 思。偶尔越界，来这边唱唱曲，读读书，挺好。不过，既然都在白露山待了那么多年，不 真如你们所想做点什么，还真是有点不甘心。 ” 岳清源指尖一弹，玄肃出鞘三寸，灵力暴涨。天琅君身上骨骼错位般咯咯作响， “ 咦 ” 了一 声，道： “ 果然是掌门。 ” 他伸出一手，直接握住玄肃剑锋，恍如无知无觉，笑道： “ 为何不尽数拔出？只是这样， 还奈何不了我。 ” 岳清源目光一沉，玄肃再次出鞘半寸！ 忽听洛冰河凉凉地道： “ 他奈何不了你。我呢？ ” 天琅君笑容未褪，突然，一道强劲的魔气如斧砍刀劈般袭来。 他仅剩的那只手脱臂而出，被狂风卷起，飞出洞外，直坠下埋骨岭。 洛冰河终于出手了！ 这对父子再次对上，这次，终于轮到天琅君毫无还手之力。 洛冰河两眼红得刺目，紧绷着脸，出手狠戾，毫不容情。天琅君现在双手皆断，竟然有了 左支右咄、应接不暇之态。竹枝郎好不容易才摆脱了漠北君，脸上身上已是血肉模糊，见 主受困，像是杀昏了头，横冲直闯过去。恰好无妄被天琅君魔气扫过，口喷鲜血，向后飞 出，无尘大师迎身去接。眼看竹枝郎就要撞上他，沈清秋见势不好，闪身挡在无尘身前。 竹枝郎一见沈清秋，黄澄澄的瞳孔闪过一丝清明，猛地刹步。导致身形不稳，踉跄着险些 栽倒，正要绕过沈清秋去助天琅君，倏地一道白光横穿而来。竹枝郎背部重重撞上洞壁， 被生生穿胸钉在了岩石之上。 他胸口那半截修长的剑身，正是正阳。 沈清秋回头，洛冰河缓缓收手。天琅君平静地站在他身后两丈之外。 只站了一会儿，他就姿势优雅地倒了下去。 …… 打完了？ 这么简单？ 沈清秋还有点没法接受。 他都没打几下呢。这就完了？！ 他拍尚清华： “…… 你不是说天琅君很难打吗？ ” 尚清华说： “…… 是很难啊。 ” 沈清秋： “ 这赢的有逻辑吗？ ” 尚清华： “ 再难打的 boss ，也会被男主端了。这不是公认的逻辑吗？ ” 两人环顾四周，来时有数十人，满血状态，到现在，站着的已经没剩几个了。 沈清秋看着之前视作超难关卡 boss 的两位。 一个正躺在地上，十分符合 “ 饱受 □□ 的破布娃娃 ” 的描述；一个被钉在墙上，鲜血淋漓。 半点也没有打完终极 boss 的酣畅淋漓之感，越看越觉得，这根本就是己方在欺负老弱病残 ，仗着人多不要脸地群殴 …… 是的他们的确是在群殴！ 可谁知道会变成这样？ boss 实力和想象中的差太多了！ 洛冰河转回身，滴血未沾，气定神闲，问沈清秋： “ 要杀了他吗？ ” 他指的是天琅君。竹枝郎闻言，握住正阳剑身，奋力外拔。他脖子脸上鳞片似乎在混战中 被刮去不少，这时一阵一阵用力，血流如注。 自从知道公仪萧为他所杀后，沈清秋心里一直有个疙瘩，但这幅模样，实在惨不忍睹，见 者很难不同情。而且，虽然沈清秋被他诡异的报恩方式坑了无数次，可好歹竹枝郎从没对 他起过坏心思。 他心想，这人一生稀里糊涂，都是因为脑子转不过弯，叹道： “ 都变成这样了。你何苦。 ” 竹枝郎咳出一口血沫，干哑地说： “ 变成这样？ ” 他苦笑道： “ 如果我说，白露山那副模样，才是我的原身，沈仙师你有何想法？ ” 一个轰天雷劈到沈清秋脑门顶上。 怎么，原来白露林那在地上爬爬爬的蛇男才是竹枝郎的原始形态吗？！ 竹枝郎喘了一口气，道： “ 我说过，我血统微贱，只因我父亲是一条巨蛇，母亲生下我时 ，便是这半人半蛇的畸形模样。一直长到十五岁，旁人皆弃我恶我，辱我驱我。若非君上 助我化为人身，我便一生都是那蠕动在地的怪物。 ” 他咬牙道： “ 君上第一个让我为人，沈仙师你则是第二个。或许对你们而言，不过举手之 劳，对我来说，却是万死莫敢不报 …… 沈仙师问我 ‘ 何苦 ’ ？你说我是何苦？ ” 天琅君忽然叹道： “ 傻孩子，你跟他说那么多做什么？ ” 他虽然躺着，却躺的依旧很雍容，如果忽略掉被魔气侵蚀的小半张脸，就更雍容了。 他望着天，悠悠地说： “ 人啊，总是相信非我族类，其心必异。再亲密的人，转眼也可以 欺骗于你。何况一直都只是你一厢情愿地要报恩？你说再多，他也不懂你，只会厌烦。又 何必多言？ ” …… 莫非他这么多年，一直以为当年是苏夕颜刻意将他骗上白露山的？ 沈清秋本想脱口而出，你误会大了！可他再看一旁面无表情的洛冰河，又说不出话了。 无尘大师却道： “ 若阁下当年真的无此意图，听信谗言，是我们的错。今日之事，躲不过 ，避不得。种恶因，得恶果，迟早都要偿还。 ” 他合掌道： “ 可苏施主不惜自服毒药，也要去见你一面，又怎能说她是欺骗你？ ” 天琅君微微一愣，抬起了头。 沈清秋心里也是一动。好歹，无尘大师把 “ 堕胎药 ” 改成了 “ 毒药 ” ，也算是照顾了下洛冰河 的感受。 他躯体残缺，这样勉力抬头，还有血迹凝在唇边，竟有种说不出来的可怜。 顿了半晌，天琅君道： “…… 是吗。 ” 说完这两个字。他又问了一句： “ 真的？ ” 无尘大师道： “ 老衲敢以性命担保，所言非虚。 ” 天琅君转头，看向沈清秋和岳清源，索证般地问道： “ 真的？ ” 岳清源点头，沈清秋也缓缓一点头。 天琅君像是忽然脱了力，重新躺了下去。 他叹道： “ 好吧。好歹，总算有件不那么糟糕的事。 ” 沈清秋转头去看洛冰河。 他正微微低头，眼睫垂着，沾了一点雪花，轻轻颤动。 这样把话说开，天琅君的心结固然是解了。可对洛冰河而言，未免残忍。 心魔剑还在源源不断散发着紫黑之气，下方厮杀之声越发清晰。恐怕埋骨岭的下落仍在持 续，不知距离洛川冰面，还有多少距离。 岳清源朝插着心魔剑的岩壁走了几步。沈清秋道： “ 事已至此。天琅君，你收手吧。 ” 现在收手，还不算太晚，如果天琅君继续往心魔剑中输送魔气，就真的只有杀了他才能阻 止合并了。怎么说，沈清秋也并不特别希望天琅君真的去死。 毕竟，谈个恋爱被坑成这样，实在是够倒霉了。再要人家的命 …… 没有哪个 boss 这么苦逼 的！ 天琅君却忽然扑哧一下，笑出了声。 笑声在山洞和岭中回荡。 他像是觉得十分滑稽，歪头道： “ 沈峰主，你看，现在的我，甚至连竹枝郎的人形都维持 不住了啊。 ” 这时候，沈清秋还没觉察他话中的意思，只是隐隐觉得心中哪里一跳。 天琅君慢条斯理道： “ 和你们斗了这么久，我这副身体，消耗不可谓不大。你以为，一直 撑住心魔剑魔气供给的，究竟是谁？ ” 这句话他说的不快不慢，可进了沈清秋耳朵里，一字一句，听得他如坠冰窟，脖颈渐渐僵 硬起来。 “ 你是该叫人收手。只是，那个人却不是我。 ” 作者有话要说：正文结局倒计时中。","CHAPTER 78: PAST FACES LONG GONE Shen Qingqiu said, “That’s not the problem.” Luo Binghe wouldn’t let it go. “Then what is the problem?” Shen Qingqiu raised his fan. “Let’s settle our current task first. We can talk about it later.” Luo Binge slowly retreated, smiling faintly. “Fine.” He said softly, “Either way there’s plenty of time to talk about it later.” Everyone present could sense countless numbers of creatures stirring, hidden beneath the surface of the dark thicket of branches, waist-high brush, and piles of deathly pale stone all around. Lustrous green eyes and whispering pants rose and fell like tiny waves. At this time, the advantage of having Luo Binghe walk in front was fully apparent. As long as it was him facing the direction they were walking, the sinister winds would immediately pause, and not a single voice would be heard 306 . The hidden demonic beasts would either play dead in force or frantically stream into retreat. To say it a bit coarsely, it was like they were fleeing a god of pestilence… With this godly assistance, the time it took to reach their destination was much shorter than anticipated. If there was suddenly a column of roiling black energy rushing into the sky in the middle of a field of curling white fog, anyone who wasn’t blind could see the anomaly. The cavern mouth was hidden by layer upon layer of thick green leaves, dark as an overcast forest. Standing beside the cave mouth would give anyone a fit of chills. Their party halted their footsteps in hesitation. According to his original imaginings, before reaching this stage they should have had to kill eight hundred enemy generals, chopped up a thousand demonic beasts, and met all sorts of poisonous insects and strange flowers on the way before they could reach the last hurdle after thousands of trials and tribulations. Even if there weren’t that many formalities, shouldn’t they have at least gotten some blood on their clothes before they were worthy of the BOSS fight? One of the sect leaders said, “I’m afraid we cannot make a rash move.” Another agreed, “It’s best if we scout out the real situation first.” Luo Binghe said, “That’s for sure.” He had just finished speaking when Mobei-Jun suddenly kicked ShangQinghua out. He really just kicked him… out… out… out… Right in front of Shen Qingqiu’s astonished gaze, Shang Qiuhua rolled and fell into the cavern to “scout out the real situation.” After a moment of deathly stillness, a wretched screech suddenly exploded out from inside the cave. “AHHHHHHHHH!” At lightning speed, Shen Qingqiu shoved aside a handful of vines to pour into the cavern with the others when he heard a voice sound out. “Peak Lord Shen, we meet again 307 .” The Xin Mo sword was stuck in a crack in the rock at the far end of the cavern. That black energy and purple smoke were spilling from its point. Tianlang-Jun sat atop a piece of limestone, Shang Qinghua standing not far from the rock. Natural light from outside the cave flowed in, illuminating half of Tianlang-Jun’s body. Immediately, some drew in a cold breath. Shen Qingqiu finally knew why Shang Qinghua’s earlier screech was so wretched. Even though the smile on Tianlang-Jun’s face was as elegant as before, almost half the right side of his face had rotted into a purple-black mass, making this smile an extremely frightful sight. His left sleeve was deflated, empty. Apparently, that arm which kept falling off couldn’t be reattached anymore. This dilapidated appearance, a dry lamp out of oil, was far from the final BOSS Shen Qingqiu had imagined. Shen Qingqiu couldn’t resist taking a glance at Luo Binghe’s expression. But, his face only held a nearly wooden calm, an emotion he couldn’t decipher. Tianlang-Jun tilted his head, saying, “Fewer came than I imagined. I had thought it would be like last time at Bailu Mountain with hundreds of experts coming into battle.” Wu Wang snorted. “Look at this appearance of yours, human but not human, demon but not demon, you don’t even have a single lackey by your side. Do we even need that many people to come?” Tianlang-Jun said, “It’s true that I don’t have a lackey here, but I do have a nephew.” Before his words had fallen, a green shadow flashed across the cavern mouth. Without a breath of sound, Zhuzhi-Lang blocked in front of Tianlang- Jun.For some reason, this master-servant pair were both in a sorry state. Tianlang-Jun’s Dew Flower body wasn’t suited to demonic energy and had rotted until it was full of holes; this was understandable. But, Zhuzhi-lang also had pupils suffused with yellow, plate after plate of scales crawling up to cover his neck, cheeks, forehead, arms, and all exposed skin. It was a frightful and sinister sight, very close to his half-human half-snake form in the Dew Flower cave. He said hoarsely, “Master Shen.” Shen Qingqiu said, “It’s me… how did you end up like this?” Yue Qingyuan said, not batting an eyelid, “Shidi, you have some relationship with this person?” A deep relationship indeed 308 . In the course of events up until today, he had had the most important sort of connection with this person. Shen Qingqiu was just about to speak when Tianlang-Jun faintly raised his chin, squinting at Yue Qingyuan. “I remember you.” He thought, then said, certain, “At that time, that old man from Huan Hua Palace wanted you to help him mount a sneak attack, but you didn’t pay him any attention. Now, the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect Leader is you? Not bad.” Yue Qingyuan said, “Sire, your memory is not bad as well.” Tianlang-Jun smiled, then let out a sigh. “If you were also suppressed in a pitch-black place for decades, never seeing the sun, with only the option of thinking of things past to while away the time every day, your memory would be not bad just like mine 309 .“ This time, no one responded. Yue Qingyuan gripped Xuan Su, striking out with sword and scabbard included. Tianlang-Jun was just about to dodge the strike when, with waves of rumbling, half the cave wall behind him collapsed, opening a big hole. The outside was high in the air, flying sand and rolling stones tumbling to drop down in a fall. The cold air suddenly rolled in, fine snowflakes dancing through the air to confuse everyone’s sight. Wave surging over wave of beastly cries and the sounds of battle faintly floated up from the ice surface hundreds of meters below. The first wave of Southern Border demons had already touched ground. Tianlang-Jun said, “I’d guess, it’s definitely Bai Zhan Peak fighting on the front lines again. Am I right?” Dozens of people had scattered, each charging over from every angle. Wu Wang, brandishing his spiritual staff into a formidable wind, extremely firm and fierce, stole to the very front. Zhuzhi-Lang was pushed to retreat step by step byXuan Su, but still diligently drew a good part of the firepower. Tianlang-Jun continued to sit on the limestone and said leisurely, “I remember at that time, you dragged it out until the very last moment to draw your sword. Will you do the same today?” Yue Qingyuan didn’t respond. Just when he was about to send a palm strike at Zhuzhi-Lang’s chest, another Sect Leader stole ahead to strike first. Zhuzhi-Lang didn’t dodge or retreat, taking the full force of the strike, but the one who let out a wretched scream was actually that Sect Leader. Shen Qingqiu’s pupils suddenly contracted. He yelled, “Don’t touch him ━ his body is covered in poison!” In the chaos of battle, a few people were poisoned, a few others jolted out of the cave by the bursts of demonic energy and spiritual energy. Their bodies thrown out in midair, they would flip onto their swords mid-fall and steady themselves. Shang Qinghua surreptitiously slid towards Shen Qingqiu. Zhuzhi- Lang was caught in the raging bloodlust of battle, and unexpectedly seeing a furtive figure sneaking towards the outside, reflexively flung over two green snakes. Seeing this, Shen Qingqiu flicked his hand, a green leaf flying out to save Airplane-juju’s life, when the two green snakes were suddenly skewered by a sharp spike of ice solidifying out of midair. Mobei-Jun appeared in the middle of the battle like a ghost, picked up Shang Qinghua, tossed him at Shen Qingqiu like tossing a chicken, and smashed a fist towards Zhuzhi-Lang. In the next ten seconds, Shen Qingqiu finally witnessed first-hand what could be called a “vicious beating”… With Zhuzhi-Lang suffering Mobei-Jun’s wild beating, the firepower directed at Tianlang-Jun suddenly heightened. Though Tianlang-Jun was down an arm and fighting one on many, his elegant poise still didn’t drop a pinch. “Ay, why are you like this again. Fighting many on one, don’t you think you’re winning without a fight, violating the rules of justice?” One Sect Leader rushed to attack. “Towards you, this type of Demon Race monster harboring evil intentions, fearing that any part of the world is not in chaos, what justice is there to be said!” The next moment, his head exploded into pieces like a clove of garlic. Tianlang-Jun smiled. “Actually, I didn’t really have any evil intentions at first, and I wasn’t quite interested in seeing the whole world in chaos. I would occasionally cross the border and come to this side to sing some songs and readsome books. It was very nice. But, now that I’ve stayed under Bailu Mountain for that many years, I’m a bit reluctant not to do some of those things you’re thinking of.” Yue Qingyuan flicked his finger. Xuan Su unsheathed by three inches, spiritual energy exploding up. Tianlang-Jun’s body creaked like his skeleton was shifted out of alignment, making a sound of surprise. “Sure enough, you are a Sect Leader. Very good, your shifu himself wasn’t much to speak of, but his eye in picking disciples and successors was quite good.” He reached out a hand, directly grabbing Xuan Su’s point. He smiled as if he was ignorant and unaware of everything around him. “But why don’t you draw it completely? Just like this, you still can’t do anything to me.” Yue Qingyuan’s gaze darkened, and Xuan Su drew out another half inch! Suddenly, he heard Luo Binghe say coldly, “He can’t do anything to you. What about me?” Tianlang-Jun had not yet shed his smile when, suddenly, a strong stream of demonic energy surged over, chopping down like a machete. His only remaining hand shed its arm and flew out of the cavern, swept up by a wild gale, falling straight down Maigu Ridge. Luo Binghe finally showed his hand! This father-son pair once again faced off, and this time, it was finally Tianlang-Jun who had no power to retaliate. Luo Binghe’s eyes were glaringly red, his face stretched taut, his strikes ruthless and tyrannical, not allowing any mercy. Now, both of Tianlang-Jun’s hands were gone. Even with his left arm and right stump he was pushed to his limits. When Zhuzhi-Lang broke away from Mobei-Jun, his face and body were already a mass of blood and flesh. Seeing his master hard-pressed, it was like he had lost his head in the melee, crashing his way straight over. Right at that time, Wu Wang had been brushed by Tianlang-Jun’s demonic energy, flying backward and spewing a mouthful of blood as Great Master Wu Chen went to catch him. Seeing Zhuzhi-Lang about to collide with him, Shen Qingqiu knew the situation was taking a bad turn. He flashed over to block in front of Wu Chen. Upon seeing Shen Qingqiu, a wisp of clarity flashed through Zhuzhi- Lang’s glistening yellow pupils. He violently braked, losing his balance and nearly stumbling into a fall. Just when he was going to detour around Shen Qingqiu to go help Tianlang-Jun, a flash of white light suddenly shot across the scene. Zhuzhi-Lang’s back heavily thudded into the cave wall, nailed into thecliff rock through his chest. That half-length of slender sword blade in his chest was precisely Zheng Yang 310 . Shen Qingqiu turned, and Luo Binghe slowly pulled back. Tianlang-Jun stood serenely some meters behind him. He only stood for a while, then gracefully collapsed to the ground. … The battle is over? It was this easy? Shen Qingqiu still felt this was a bit unacceptable. He didn’t even get in a few strikes. And they’re done just like this? He smacked Shang Qinghua. “Didn’t you say Tianlang-Jun was very hard to fight?” Shang Qinghua said, “It is very hard.” Shen Qingqiu: “Is there any logic to this win?” Shang Qinghua: “No matter how difficult a BOSS, don’t even think of making a wave in front of the male protagonist. Isn’t this the publicly known logic?” The two looked all around. There were dozens of people when they came, but now, in this blood-filled scene, only a few were left standing. Shen Qingqiu looked at the two he used to regard as a BOSS level of extreme difficulty. One was nailed to the wall, dripping blood; one was lying on the ground, fitting the description of “rag doll, trampled and strings broken” one hundred percent. He didn’t feel the unrestrained satisfaction of defeating the final BOSS a bit. The more he looked, the more it felt like his side was bullying the old and the disabled, like a shameless gang beating… That’s right, this definitely was a gang beating. But who knew it would become like this? The BOSS’s actual strength fell too far from their expectations! Luo Binghe turned, not yet dyed by a drop of blood. Calm and composed, he asked Shen Qingqiu, “Do you want to kill him?” He was pointing at Tianlang-Jun. Zhuzhi-Lang heard and grabbed Zheng Yang’s blade, straining to pull it out. Many of the scales on his neck and face had been scraped off in the chaos of battle, and with these bursts of strength, blood began to pour down in streams. Ever since he knew Gongyi Xiao had been killed by him, Shen Qingqiu always felt a bit of discomfort in his heart. But this scene really was a spectacleto horrible to endure, and it was hard for onlookers not to sympathize. And, even though Shen Qingqiu had been afflicted by his strange method of repaying gratitude countless times, at the very least Zhuzhi-Lang had never held any evil intentions towards him. Shen Qingqiu sighed. “You’ve already gotten to this state. Why bother?” Zhuzhi-Lang coughed out a mouthful of bloody foam, saying hoarsely, “Gotten to this state?” He smiled bitterly. “If I said that my appearance at Bailu Mountain was my original body, what would Master Shen think?” A peal of thunder crashed onto Shen Qingqiu’s forehead. What, that snake man crawling all over the ground on Bailu Mountain was actually Zhuzhi-Lang’s original form? Zhuzhi-Lang gasped a breath and said, “My lineage is humble. Just because my father was a primal giant snake, I was in this deformed half-human half-snake shape when my mother gave birth to me. Up until I was fifteen, others would always shun me and hate me, insult me and beat me. If my Lord never helped me gain a human form and support me, I would be a monster squirming on the ground my whole life.” He clenched his teeth and said, “My Lord gave me my first chance to become human, and you, Master Shen, gave me my second. Maybe it was merely the wave of a hand to you both, but to me, it’s a debt I’d pursue through ten thousand deaths… Master Shen is asking me ‘why bother’? You tell me why I bother.” Tianlang-Jun suddenly sighed. “Silly child, why are you telling him so much?” Even though he was lying on the ground, he was as graceful and poised as ever. If you ignored the half of his face which had been corroded by demonic energy, he would be even more graceful and poised. He gazed at the sky and continued pensively, “People, always believe that ‘those of different clans, their hearts must travel different paths 311 .’ But, no matter how close someone is to you, they could betray you in the blink of an eye. Why have you always clung to your one-sided wish of repaying gratitude? No matter how much you say, he won’t understand you; he’ll only get fed up and not comprehend. Why do you need to say any more?” For a while, everyone on the scene stayed in silence. A good-natured youth who had had no vicious intentions, full-heartedly enjoying discussions of love, only to find it was nothing but a trap, and then suppressed under a dark andsunless mountain for countless days and nights. Who had the right to tell him not to hold a grudge? Who had the right to tell him, “Let it go, get over it”? But, Great Master Wu Chen said, “If sire truly did not hold these intentions in the past, it was our wrong to have believed slanderous charges. But you cannot hide or flee from today’s disaster. Every evil cause will bring about evil fruits. Sooner or later they will all be repaid.” He clasped his hands and said, “But Miss Su didn’t hesitate to take the poison and wanted to go see you. How can you blame her for betraying you?” Tianlang-Jun started slightly, raising his head. Shen Qingqiu also felt his heart tremble. Great Master Wu Chen would never tell a lie, but the version of events he told seemed to be a bit different from the one other people told and knew. Great Master Wu Chen said, “At Zhao Hua Temple, because I didn’t want Miss Su to suffer criticism after her death, and because I agreed to protect the secret, this old monk could not talk and explain the true facts. “Miss Su was forcibly detained in Huan Hua Palace by the Old Palace Master. She was stubborn and refused to take orders; she wasn’t willing to trick you to the ambush location which had been set up with dozens of suppressing spells. The Old Palace Master only discovered that she was already pregnant when he was punishing her in the Water Prison. He feared that forcing an abortion would endanger her life, and Miss Su was even more willing to resist at all costs. So, the Old Palace Master gave her a bowl of poison, a type of poison deadly to the demon race, and told her that as long as she was willing to drink it, he would let her go to see you. “Miss Su drank the Old Palace Master’s drug and set off alone. But she didn’t know that the Old Palace Master had changed the ambush location to the Bailu Mountain where you two used to meet.” In his shattered body, Tianlang-Jun strove to lift his head. A bloodstain was still drying on his lip and, in a daze, he indeed had a kind of unspeakably pathetic appearance. “This old monk met Miss Su on the road to Bailu Mountain. At that time, it was not long after she had drunk the drug, and her whole body was covered in blood, leaving crimson trails with every step. I heard her say a few fragments in explanation, and couldn’t bear to deceive her. After I told her the truth about how Tianlang-Jun had already been suppressed for good, she finally knew that all her Shifu had told her was a towering lie. Not only was the location incorrect, but the time was too!“At her request, this old monk protected her and helped her evade the Huan Hua Palace disciples on patrol, sending her to the upper reaches of the Luochuan River. From then on, I didn’t know any more traces of her whereabouts. “Tianlang-Jun, maybe it’s true that Miss Su wasn’t a purely benevolent person. She, the Huan Hua Palace successor with high hopes piled on her, was originally set up high. In the beginning, she may have gotten close to you without good intentions. But in the end, between the two of you, was it you who bewitched her with malicious intent or her who couldn’t keep a handle on her emotions? “This old monk was not a player in this affair, and I never knew any of these truths. But, from what I saw and what I knew, she really did reject the orders of the shifu who had raised her for decades and didn’t open her mouth even after suffering all kinds of torture in the Water Prison, refusing to trick you or harm you ━ if in the end she wasn’t pushed to using a last resort, which mother in this world would drink that bowl of poison? “She did not abandon and reject you, but had no other alternative. No one in this world pitied her, you just missed the opportunity ah…” Tianlang-Jun’s lip seemed to tremble. After a while, he said, “Is that so.” He finished these three words. Then, he asked, “It’s true?” Great Master Wu Chen said, “This old monk would swear on his life, not half a sentence of these words were false.” Tianlang-Jun turned his head, looking at Shen Qingqiu and Yue Qingyuan, and asked as if searching for confirmation. “It’s true?” He didn’t even care if the onlookers knew the truth of the situation, asking every person he could find. Yue Qingyuan faced him, wordless, silently lowering his head and pondering something unknown. Shen Qingqiu thought it over again and again before finally slowly nodding his head. Perhaps the Old Palace Master didn’t hold any intent of slander and injury at first but, seeing the two gradually grow closer, he began to regret sending Su Xiyan to approach Tianlang-Jun. Su Xiyan had lost control of the situation and actually fell in love with Tianlang-Jun wholeheartedly, even having Luo Binghe; this was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Then, the Old Palace Master produced evidence out of context, gave short measure, wove a series of events, and cast Tianlang-Jun straight into the role of an exceptional devil hungering to topple the ThreeRealms. And plainly wrecked this many people for this many years. Tianlang-Jun seemed to suddenly lose all his strength, once again collapsing to the ground. He sighed. “Alright. At least, there’s one thing that wasn’t that terrible.” A few snowflakes dotted his eyelashes, trembling into motion. He didn’t know whether it was this first snowfall to grace his brow in decades, or solidified tears that hadn’t fallen. Shen Qingqiu turned to look at Luo Binghe. He had listened from beginning to end but seemed as if he had heard nothing at all, even letting out a quiet chuckle. After explaining all these events, the knot gnawing at Tianlang-Jun’s heart had been untied. But to Luo Binghe, the degree of cruelty had not lowered a bit. It had only gone from the result of being rejected by mother and father to the result of being given up on by mother and father. He was the one who was given up on just like before. The Xin Mo sword was still emitting a steady flow of purple-black energy, and the sounds of battle below grew clearer and clearer. It seemed that the descent of Maigu Ridge was continuing, some unknown distance from the iced- over surface of the Luochuan. Yue Qingyuan walked a few steps towards the cliff wall pierced by the Xin Mo sword. Shen Qingqiu said, “Things are already like this. Tianlang-Jun, you should withdraw.” If he withdrew now, it still was not too late. But if Tianlang-Jun continued to pour demonic energy into the Xin Mo sword, the only way to stop the merge would really be to kill him. How to say, Shen Qingqiu did not especially wish for Tianlang-Jun to actually die. After all, for the youth who liked to speak of love to become like this really was enough of a tragedy. If they were to take his life as well… where could you find a BOSS this miserable! But, Tianlang-Jun suddenly let out a laugh. That laugh resounded through the cavern and the mountain ridge. He seemed to find the situation extremely comical, tilting his head and saying, “Peak Lord Shen, look at how I am now ━ I can’t even maintain Zhuzhi-Lang’s human shape.” At this time, Shen Qingqiu had not yet detected the meaning within his words, only faintly feeling his heart jump in his chest. Tianlang-Jun drawled, “I’ve fought with you people for this long, and the toll on this body of mine could not be said to be small. Think about it, the onewho’s been supplying the Xin Mo sword with demonic energy this whole time, who could that be?” These words were not spoken especially fast or slow, but after they entered Shen Qingqiu’s ear, it was a sentence a word. Hearing them, his neck gradually stiffened as though he had fallen into an icy rift. “You should indeed tell someone to withdraw. It’s just that, that person is not me.”"
"天琅君肢体已残破不堪 , 竹枝郎被钉在岩壁上 , 无尘大师扶着头破血流的无妄 , 漠北君拎着尚 清华，岳清源站在沈清秋身边。 只有洛冰河立在正对心魔剑的位置上 , 正低头 , 慢慢整着袖口。 沈清秋沉声道： “ 洛冰河 , 你过来。 ” 洛冰河摇了一下头。 只一下 , 但非常坚定。 沈清秋失望透顶，冷声道： “…… 你又骗我。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 师尊 , 我说过会帮你对付天琅君。现在我可以立刻杀了他给你看 , 怎能说我是骗 你？ ” 天琅君笑道： “ 养寇自重 , 这一步棋想的是挺好。只可惜我不太中用，还是得他亲自出马 了。 ” “ 养寇自重 ” 四个字一出来，沈清秋越发心中不安。 心魔剑，会不会是洛冰河故意给天琅君的。 拿到心魔剑后，天琅君那露华芝塑成的身躯 , 腐蚀的越来越快，就算把剑给他，对洛冰河 也构不成多大威胁。 也许是他乱过了头，把心中所想也漏在了脸上，洛冰河伤感地说： “ 师尊，你又在想什么 呢？心魔剑的确是他抢去的，只是它仍旧认我这个主人而已。为什么又不肯相信我了 呢？ ” 沈清秋缓缓地说： “ 我信了你很多次。到刚才为止，还一直是相信你的。 ” 洛冰河说： “ 是吗？ ” 他牵起一个扭曲的笑容： “ 可我却不敢相信师尊了。 ” 这笑容诡异至极。沈清秋觉察他情绪不对劲，放缓了表情和语气： “ 你究竟是又怎么了。 ” 他稍微温柔一点，洛冰河便忽然不笑了。 他看上去像是伤心欲绝的样子： “ 师尊，我就说过，果真你和他们在一起的时候，是最高 兴的。 ” 刚开始，沈清秋还没弄明白 “ 他们 ” 指的是什么。 洛冰河在心魔剑的岩壁前，缓缓来回踱着。 他自嘲地笑道： “ 每次我求师尊跟我走，你从来没有一次答应。即便答应了，也只是我强 求所致。可他们让你留下来的时候，你便毫不犹豫。 ” 他看着沈清秋： “ 师尊，你不常笑。我爱看你笑，可是一想到，你只有在和他们一道时， 才会这样笑，我就 ……” 他轻声细语道： “…… 非常，非常痛苦。 ” 沈清秋终于明白了。 “ 他们 ” ，指的是苍穹山派！ 那天在竹舍，柳清歌忽然开窗查看，果然觉察到了一直徘徊在外的洛冰河。 他没有离去，而是把竹舍内的欢声笑语、把他那一声 “ 嗯 ” 的应承，全部听在了耳中，记在 了心里。 沈清秋道： “ 你是因为这件事，所以生气了？ ” “ 生气？ ” 反问之后，洛冰河阴戾地吐出两个字： “ 我恨！ ” “ 我恨我自己！ ” 他负着手，暴躁地加快步伐。 “ 我恨我没用。我恨我总是留不住任何人，从来 …… 没有谁肯选择我。 ” 洞中其余人都不便轻举妄动。洛冰河现在维持着心魔剑的供给，谁都不想他突然发难。 岳清源却道： “ 你的意思，是要他二选一？ ” 洛冰河顿住脚步，摇了摇头： “ 二选一？不。这不是。 ” “ 我知道，如果要选，师尊一定不会选我。所以，只要没有选择就好了。 ” 洛冰河流露出一种奇异的兴奋，苍白的脸涌上一层潮红。 “ 所以这次我吸取了教训。苍穹山派不存在就好了。这样，师尊就只剩我了。 ” 无尘大师不忍卒听，合掌佛号不断，阿弥陀佛道： “ 洛施主，你魔怔了。 ” 洛冰河兀自大笑，无尘大师继续道： “ 没有选择的可能，固然也没有了放弃你的可能。但 沈峰主对你的所作所为，又怎会释怀？ ” 洛冰河柔声道： “ 师尊，清静峰没了，我可以再给你造一个。你怨我也好，恨我也罢。我 不奢求什么了。你一不顺心，就可以打我，杀我，反正我死不了。只要 …… 只要你不离开 我就好。 ” 他虔诚地说： “ 真的，我只有这一个愿望了。 ” 沈清秋喉咙干哑，口里发苦，说不出话来。 他终于确定，洛冰河已经神智不清了。 他瞳孔涣散，红色的涟漪时扩时缩，笑容扭曲，真真正正是一副彻底发疯、失去理智的模 样。心魔剑上紫光大盛，不知道他在控制这把剑，还是这把剑在控制他。 竹枝郎忽然道： “ 除了苍穹山派，这世上沈仙师在意的东西千千万，你是不是都要毁了才 好？ ” 洛冰河莞尔道： “ 好啊？为什么不好！ ” 他一侧头，陡转阴鸷： “ 让他闭嘴！ ” 漠北君闻言，想了想，对准竹枝郎脸部打了一拳。 天琅君看着洛冰河，目光中悯色闪动，叹道： “…… 心魔剑已经侵蚀入脑。他真的疯了。 ” 洛冰河微笑着点头： “ 对。我是疯了。 ” 沈清秋听他亲口承认自己发疯，心脏一阵抽搐的闷痛。 他轻声道： “ 冰河，你先离开那把剑，离它站远点。 ” 他一边温言相劝，一边手在宽袖底悄悄按上了修雅剑剑柄。洛冰河笑道： “ 没用的。师尊 ，你不必这样。你越是对我好，我越是怕。 ” 他说着，右手做了个略略上扬的手势。刹那间，心魔剑上紫气大盛。 竹枝郎吐出一口淤血。刚才那一拳，也只让他闭嘴了一会儿。他平静地道： “ 可怜。 ” “ 可怜？ ” 洛冰河喃喃道： “ 不错，我是可怜。就算是可怜我也好，师尊你能有一次留在我 身边吗？ ” 泪水顺着他的脸颊滚滚流下。 洛冰河瞳孔赤红地咬着牙： “ 师尊你总是一次又一次地放开我。 ” “ 每一次，每一次，任何人、任何事物！都能够成为你抛弃我理由，每一次都是这样！ ” 忽然，尚清华啪的一声摔到地上。沈清秋也下意识扶住了石壁。 整个地面开始剧烈地震颤。 埋骨岭的下坠速度加快了！ 岳清源淡淡地道： “ 师弟，他是疯了，你要如何处置。 ” 洛冰河冷笑一声，后退两步，猛地抓住心魔剑柄。 地面震颤愈发强烈，透过洞口向外望去，能看见滚滚云丛中，探出无数高低不一的山头。 沈清秋刚要祭出修雅，忽的身旁白光炫目。岳清源先一步抽出了剑。 剑啸声撕裂了弥漫的飞雪和紫黑之气。 玄肃出鞘！ 漠北君见岳清源剑尖对准洛冰河，上前迎战。玄肃灵力暴涨，还未相接，直接将他震了出 去。 漠北君像是完全没料到自己也会有被人打飞的一天，保持着这种表情，转眼坠下埋骨岭。 尚清华魂飞魄散，抓了一把剑就冲过去，沈清秋忙拽住他： “ 你干啥！ ” 尚清华咆哮道： “ 我靠，他不会飞啊！ ” 说完便跳了下去。 沈清秋逆着飞雪和狂风从破口处往下看，恰好看见距离冰面还有百丈的高空中，乘着飞剑 的尚清华抓住了漠北君。 确定他摔不死后，沈清秋连一口气也来不及松，猛地转回头，洛冰河已和岳清源正面对 上。 洛冰河固然爆发力可怖，沈清秋却没料到，玄肃完全出鞘后，威力竟如此强悍，能和发狂 状态下的洛冰河战成平手。沈清秋能感觉到，耳膜和喉咙被空气中激荡的灵力和魔气压得 隆隆作响。 他见这洞迟早要塌，抢上岩壁，徒手握住心魔剑，一用力，把它拔了出来！ 虽然拔了出来，可埋骨岭下落之势还没缓住。洛冰河见状，要来夺剑。岳清源哪会给他机 会，玄肃剑尖在空中划出肉眼可见的炫目轨迹，一道巨型禁制，繁复的咒印生成一座无形 的牢笼，将洛冰河禁锢其中。 岳清源见沈清秋拔了剑，沉声道： “ 走！ ” 还走？！沈清秋立刻摇头，刚要把心魔剑抛给他，便觉脚下一软。 不是他软了，是地面软了。 这个山洞，终于塌了！ 埋骨岭第二层。 沈清秋把岳清源从乱石堆里刨了出来： “ 掌门？师兄？掌门师兄！ ” 岳清源面色隐隐发白，唇角淌血，咽了咽喉咙，似乎把一口热血咽了下去。 他睁开眼睛，看了一眼沈清秋： “…… 其他人呢。 ” 埋骨岭内部结构类似不规则的蜂巢，一个洞接着一个洞。沈清秋四下望了一眼： “ 没看见 无尘大师和天琅君他们，可能埋在这里，也可能随着乱石塌到其他的洞里去了。 ” 他回头： “ 师兄，你什么时候受的伤？ ” 岳清源不答，问道： “ 心魔剑还在你手里？ ” 沈清秋把剑拿给他看： “ 在。可埋骨岭还在下落，合并应该还没结束。师兄，你带着剑下 去，把它毁了吧。 ” 岳清源在他的扶助下，慢慢站起： “…… 你呢？ ” 当然是回头找洛冰河去。 沈清秋避而不答： “ 师兄，你这伤怎么回事？ ” 岳清源答非所问，道： “ 原本不想的。可我 …… 终归是个容易冲动的人。 ” 沈清秋觉得他这话说的奇怪，却没心思细想，扶着他继续走： “ 师兄你还能走吗？你先下 去，毁剑，找木师弟。洛冰河交给我。 ” 岳清源被他扶着，勉强站起，鲜血滴滴落地。沈清秋以为他没问题了，便放开了手。 谁知，刚放开手，没站一会儿，岳清源便倒了下去。 沈清秋大惊失色，连忙把他又扶了起来： “ 师兄？师兄？ ” 岳清源神情恍惚，像是没把沈清秋的话听进去，低声说： “ 金兰城和洛冰河围山的那两次 ，我是稳住了，顾全大局了 …… 可事后每每回想，倒还不如 …… 冲动的好。 ” 看他昏昏欲睡，沈清秋恨不得猛掐岳清源人中，把他掐醒，又不敢干这越矩的事，只得在 他耳边大声说话，不让他晕过去： “ 师兄，醒醒！你做的没错！ ” 岳清源闭上眼，摇了摇头。 他喘了口气，又是一阵让沈清秋心惊肉跳的剧烈咳嗽。 血止不住地随着咳嗽往外流。他勉强道： “ 帮我 …… 把玄肃收回去。 ” 沈清秋连忙将跌落一旁、剑身白光刺目的玄肃压回鞘中，递给他。岳清源脸色这才稍微好 看了些，缓过了一口气。 他怔怔望着沈清秋收起玄肃的手，没去接，而是道： “ 若我在此身陨，你 …… 便帮我把玄 肃带回万剑峰吧。 ” 沈清秋吃了一惊： “ 你说什么？ ” 身陨？岳清源当真受伤这么严重，到了很可能要死的地步？！ 岳清源道： “ 玄肃威力奇大，我却从不拔出它来应敌，你一定猜过原因。 ” 沈清秋点头。不止他猜过，很多人都猜过。 岳清源道： “ 玄肃即是我的性命。你可明白，这是什么意思？ ” 完全不明白。 但沈清秋知道，它肯定不是修辞手法。 他还知道，岳清源接下来要说的，一定是一件从未告诉过别人的秘密。 果然，岳清源道： “ 每一次拔出玄肃，消耗的，都是我的寿元。 ” 此话一出，沈清秋顿时觉得，手中的玄肃，陡然重了千斤。 难怪他不到万不得已，从不拔剑。 以寿元催动灵力。将自己的性命和自己的剑捆绑在一起。 为什么岳清源会修这种邪道！ 沈清秋震惊地说： “ 师兄你 …… 这是走火入魔过？ ” 岳清源缓缓道： “ 我十五岁拜入穹顶峰，心有所系，急于求成，追求人剑合一境界不成， 反倒落得如此下场。与所求背道而驰，遗下大恨，懊悔终生。 ” 他说着，脸上那因为咳嗽刚涌起的那一点残余血色，忽的又褪得干干净净。沈清秋忙打断 他： “ 别说了。不是说这个的时候。我送你下去，找木师弟。 ” 两人艰难地走了几步，岳清源忽然低声道： “…… 对不起。 ” 说什么对不起。岳清源没有任何对不起他的地方。反倒是自己，老是带累岳清源，惹出一 堆麻烦。 可岳清源接下来的话，把他整个人都被震懵了。 岳清源声音都在发颤： “…… 真的 …… 对不起。 ” “ 明明是为了更快地回去，明明是想立刻去接你的 …… 可反而坏了事。我毕竟是个容易冲 动的人 ……” “ 自那以后，师尊将我关在灵犀洞一年有余，废去全身筋骨灵脉，一切打乱，休整重来。 ” “ 我尽了最大努力，可再回去的时候，秋府早已废败多日了啊 ……” 脑海深处传来什么东西碎裂的声音。 那是沈清秋的世界观。 刹那间，往日岳清源的殷切关怀，无声相护，种种画面，种种细节，走马灯一般串联在脑 海中，清明无比。 难怪 “ 沈清秋 ” 再怎么作死，掌门也从来没给他小鞋穿过，永远都是无限包容，无限忍让。 难怪，沈九没有等到回来救他的人。 岳清源，沈清秋；岳七，沈九。 原来如此，原来如此！ 岳清源道： “ 我真的 …… 不是故意不回去的。只是，生生错过了 ……” 他每说一句，鲜血便越发汹涌。沈清秋搀着他，走一步就要停两步，咬牙道： “ 别说了。 ” 后来的事，他都知道了。 岳清源却坚持道： “ 这一次，你就让我说完吧。 ” “ 正如你一直所说， ‘ 对不起 ’ 不过一句空言，根本没有用。我也从来不解释，今日告诉你 ，不是为求谅解。而是如今再不说 …… 恐怕就真的迟了。 ” 沈清秋心中酸涩，眼眶发热。 迟了。已经迟了！ 沈九已经不在了。 也许是死了，也许是像沈垣这样，魂魄转移去了另外一个陌生的世界。 可无论如何，岳清源的话，他是再也听不到了。 系统传来接连的提示： 【隐藏人物 1 竹枝郎，补完度 100% 】 【隐藏人物

提示音一片大好，喜气洋洋。沈清秋却前所未有的沮丧。 他说： “ 有什么意义吗？ ” 系统当然不会回答他。沈清秋发自内心地朝界面比了两个中指。 系统你全家都炸了！ 这系统究竟是个毛玩意儿，有什么意思？ 就是为了让他知道这些人究竟能倒霉到什么地步吗？就是为了让他亲眼见证人世间各种最 惨烈的坑爹吗？ 还是为了让他逼疯洛冰河？ 所有人都说洛冰河已经疯了。连他自己也笑着承认自己疯了。 原著中，挣扎数百万字，最终被洛冰河镇压下来的心魔剑，在这里却占据了上风，侵蚀了 洛冰河的心智。 这不是一件或者两件事造成的，而是一点一点积累起来，最后才彻底爆发。先前已经出现 过很多预兆，可沈清秋从来也没注意到。 应该说，他从来不知道，洛冰河骨子里竟然这样没有安全感，甚至到了自卑的地步。 他先是把洛冰河想得太邪恶，后来又把洛冰河想得太阳光坚强。 回头看看，心魔剑开始侵蚀洛冰河的神智，最初在昭华寺就有了征兆。 刚听到自己身世的洛冰河大受刺激。正是在最惶然的时候，他对沈清秋伸出了手，求沈清 秋跟他一起走。 可他没接住洛冰河的手，而是让洛冰河自己一个人先走。 那时候的洛冰河开始精神极度不稳定。他需要的不是安全撤离，而是和沈清秋在一起。哪 怕是被困昭华寺不得脱出，哪怕是被在场所有人围攻，也好过让他一个人离开啊！ 这对那种精神状况下的洛冰河而言，无异于 “ 抛弃 ” 。 就像是当初苏夕颜服下药物、只求去见天琅君的那一幕的重现。 正如洛冰河自己亲口说的，他不是在逼人做二选一。 因为洛冰河从骨子里就坚信他知道答案：沈清秋终有一日会抛下他。 满脑子都充斥着对没发生的事情近乎妄想症的恐惧和焦虑。怎么不是疯得彻底。 岳清源的步伐越来越软，几乎连站都站不住了。 看来刚才玄肃出鞘的那短短一段时间，对岳清源各方面的消耗真的极大。沈清秋从没见过 掌门虚弱到这种地步的模样。 岳清源一向都是沉稳而有力的，哪怕话不多不少，没有攻击性，温和可亲，却十分可靠， 不失威严。 如今，他非但连行走都困难，话也一反常态多了起来，恐怕是真觉得自己快撑不住了。 沈清秋几乎是拖着他在前行，边走边说： “ 师兄，你撑住，千万别晕过去。马上就全都好 了。 ” 岳清源怔怔地道： “ 这么多年来，你从不提过往之事，一直只叫我师兄。是打定主意，再 也不叫七哥了么？ ” 沈清秋握剑的手筋骨渐渐凸起。 岳清源想听沈九叫七哥。可是，他不是沈九啊！ 他琢磨着原装货那又冷又恨的劲儿，断然拒绝： “ 不叫。 ” 不能立 flag ！ 看看电视剧小说里那些完成了最后遗愿的角色，都是心愿一了、立刻翻眼蹬腿。 沈清秋冷硬地道： “ 你刚才说了什么，我全都没听见。撑着，下去！ ” 岳清源闭上了眼睛，叹息道： “ 小九啊 ……” 别叫了。 他不敢去想，原著中，洛冰河割下了 “ 沈清秋 ” 的两条腿，用锦盒装着送到苍穹山派。岳清 源究竟是带着什么样的心情，明知有去无回，仍义无反顾踏入洛冰河的圈套，直至万箭穿 身。 一生一次的义气，竟然要用这么多东西来偿还。 岳清源甚至来不及告诉满怀怨恨、为求多苟活一刻、帮着洛冰河将他引入陷阱的 “ 沈清秋 ” ，当年之所以没去接他的理由。 为什么不早点说。 就像他和洛冰河，也是一样的。为什么不早点说出来。 若是从一开始就别那么多揣测和理所当然，洛冰河说不定自始至终都不会黑化，会一辈子 都做清静峰上那个乖巧腼腆的徒弟。 就算退一万步，当初非要踹洛冰河下无间深渊时，他完全可以换一种方式来达成目的。 其实，甚至用不着费任何心思。直到现在，沈清秋才明白，如果他想要洛冰河下去，很可 能只消说一声，洛冰河就会听话地下去了。 沈清秋从前根本没想过有这种可能性。他不相信人有那么傻，洛冰河有那么乖。 可事实上，他真的有那么傻，那么乖。 兜兜转转，走了不少弯路，饶了这么大一个圈，茫然四顾，不知如何自处，只能懊悔 “ 早 知如此 ” 。 可这世上，从来没有 “ 早知如此 ” 。 转过这个山洞，忽的现出两个灰头土脸的身影。 一看那两颗圆滚滚亮堂堂的光头，沈清秋脱口而出： “ 无尘大师。无妄大师。 ” 身材矮小、扛着身材高大的那名和尚正是无尘大师，他的木制假腿缺失了一条，单腿艰难 独行，又腾不出手来合掌，不愿失礼，便多念了几声佛号： “ 阿弥陀佛，沈峰主，可算找 到你了。岳掌门这是怎么了？ ” 岳清源闭上眼后，便已昏昏沉沉靠在沈清秋身上。沈清秋道： “ 掌门师兄 …… 被石头砸到 脑袋了。无妄大师如何？ ” 无尘道： “ 被那位天琅君的魔气所伤，暂时未醒。洞穴坍塌，那几位魔族，全部都不见踪 影了。 ” 沈清秋拔出修雅，递了过去： “ 大师，可否拜托您，先带着我师兄和无妄大师，御剑离开 埋骨岭？ ” 无尘道： “ 沈峰主呢？ ” 沈清秋言简意赅： “ 我的徒弟，我去收拾。 ” 无尘大师肃然道： “ 沈峰主若肯坦然面对，那是再好不过。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 惭愧。但求在造成无可挽回的后果之前，了结这一桩。掌门师兄便交托给大 师了，请您下去后尽快将他交给千草峰的木师弟。沈某不胜感激。 ” 无尘放下无妄，接过修雅，端端一礼，忽然道： “ 心魔皆因执念起。 ” 沈清秋一愣： “ 大师是不是想说，若要除去心魔，非断去执念不可？ ” 无尘却摇头道： “ 若断得了，那便不是执念了。 ” “ 我想也是。 ” 沈清秋回礼，转身。 谁让他便是洛冰河的执念。","CHAPTER 79: FORMER AFFECTION IS LOST FOREVER Tianlang-Jun’s body was already extremely broken. Zhuzhi-Lang had been nailed onto the stone wall, while Great Master Wu Chen was supporting Wu Wang, whose head was bleeding. Mobei-Jun was dragging Shang Qinghua, and Yue Qingyuan stood next to Shen Qingqiu. Only Luo Binghe was standing directly across from the Xin Mo sword. His head was currently lowered, and he was calmly adjusting his sleeves. Shen Qingqiu said in a soft voice, “Luo Binghe, come here.” Luo Binghe shook his head once. Just one time, but it was very resolute. Shen Qingqiu said, disappointed, “You tricked me again.” Luo Binghe’s movements paused, and he asked in return, “Shizun, I told you I would help you deal with Tianlang-Jun; I can kill him right now for you to see, so how can you say that I tricked you?” Tianlang-Jun laughed. “Purposefully using the enemy for your own gain ━ that’s a pretty good move. It’s just too bad that I wasn’t very useful, so he still has to do it himself.” When he said “purposefully using the enemy for your own gain,” the unease in Shen Qingqiu’s heart grew even stronger. Did Luo Binghe deliberately give the Xin Mo sword to Tianlang-Jun? After all, once Tianlang-Jun got the Xin Mo sword, his body molded from the Dew Flower Seed rotted faster and faster. Even if Luo Binghe gave the sword to him, he wouldn’t be much of a threat. Perhaps his confusion was too great, and everything that he was thinking ended up leaking onto his face. Luo Binghe said, hurt, “Shizun, what are you thinking now? He did indeed steal the Xin Mo sword, but it continued to recognize me as its master, that’s all. You said that from now on, you would rather believe the best of me than the worst. Why are you not willing to trust me again?” Shen Qingqiu said slowly, “I’ve trusted you many times before. Up until a moment ago, I had always trusted you.” Luo Binghe, “Is that so?” He pulled on a twisted smile. “But I don’t dare to trust Shizun anymore.” This smile was extremely strange. Shen Qingqiu realized that something was wrong with his state of mind, and he relaxed his expression and tone ofvoice. “Now what’s wrong?” He grew a little bit gentler, but Luo Binghe suddenly stopped smiling. He looked heartbroken and devastated. “Shizun, I said it before. Sure enough, you’re the happiest when you’re together with them.” In the beginning, Shen Qingqiu still couldn’t figure out who “they” was referring to. Luo Binghe paced unhurriedly back and forth in front of the stone wall with the Xin Mo sword. He laughed self-mockingly. “Every time I begged for Shizun to come with me, you never agreed once. Even if you agreed, it was only because I did all I could to demand it of you. You were forced, and you were never willing to do so. But when they asked you to stay, you never had the slightest bit of hesitation.” He looked at Shen Qingqiu. “Shizun, you don’t laugh very often. I love to see you laugh. But when I remember that you only laugh like that when you’re together with them, I’m…” He whispered, “Very, very hurt.” Shen Qingqiu finally understood. “They” was referring to Cang Qiong Mountain. That day in the bamboo house, when Liu Qingge abruptly opened the window to investigate, he really had detected Luo Binghe, who had been hovering outside the whole time. Liu Qingge had noticed the trace of killing intent that Luo Binghe was exuding, as well as his despairing anger. He hadn’t left. Instead, he heard all the cheerful chatter and laughter coming from inside the bamboo house, including Shen Qingqiu’s sound of agreement, and he had remembered it. Shen Qingqiu said, “You’re angry because of that?” “Angry?” Luo Binghe viciously spat out two words: “I hate! “I hate myself!” He violently sped up his steps, his hands clasped behind his back. “I hate myself for being useless. I hate myself for not being able to get anybody to stay. Never… has anyone been willing to choose me.” The rest of the people in the cave couldn’t act rashly. Right now, Luo Binghe was the supply supporting the Xin Mo sword, and nobody wanted him to suddenly explode. But Yue Qingyuan said, “By doing this, aren’t you forcing him to pick a side?” Luo Binghe stopped walking, and he shook his head. “Pick a side? No. This isn’t that.“I know that if he has to choose, Shizun definitely won’t pick me. So, it’s fine as long as there isn’t a choice.” A layer of red flushed across Luo Binghe’s deathly pale face, and he was full of an odd excitement. “So, this time, I’ve learned my lesson. If Cang Qiong Mountain doesn’t exist, wouldn’t everything be fine? This way, Shizun will only have me.” Great Master Wu Chen couldn’t bear to listen any longer. His hands were pressed together as he endlessly chanted the names of Buddha. “Benefactor Luo, you’ve gone insane.” Luo Binghe was still laughing loudly. Great Master Wu Chen continued, “If there’s no possibility of choosing, then admittedly, there’s no possibility of abandoning you. But how can you dismiss everything that Peak Lord Shen has done for you?” Luo Binghe said tenderly, “Shizun, if Qing Jing Peak is gone, I can create a new one for you. It’s fine if you resent me or hate me. I won’t make any more unreasonable requests. If you’re unhappy, you can hit me or kill me. In any case, I won’t die. As long as… as long as you don’t leave me, I’ll be fine.” He said sincerely, “Really. This is the only wish I have left.” Looking at Luo Binghe’s hazy consciousness and qi-deviating appearance, Shen Qingqiu’s mouth tasted bitter, and he couldn’t say anything. Luo Binghe’s eyes were unfocused, and the circle of blood red around his pupils occasionally expanded and shrank. His smile was warped, and he genuinely looked like someone who had gone completely mad and lost his rationality. Shen Qingqiu didn’t know if Luo Binghe was the one controlling the sword, or if the sword was controlling him. Zhuzhi-Lang said, “Besides Cang Qiong Mountain, there are thousands of things that Master Shen cares for in this world. Will you only be happy if you destroy them all?” Luo Binghe smiled. “Yeah? Why wouldn’t it be fine?” He tilted his head to the side before he suddenly turned and said ruthlessly, “Shut him up!” When Mobei-Jun heard this, he thought a little before he punched Zhuzhi- Lang in the face. Tianlang-Jun looked at Luo Binghe, pity flashing through his eyes. He sighed. “The Xin Mo sword has already corroded your mind. You’ve gone mad.” This was the only time since he and Luo Binghe had met that he had anexpression that looked a little like that of a father’s. But Luo Binghe was completely unaware of it, and he smiled faintly as he nodded. “That’s right. I’ve gone mad.” When Shen Qingqiu heard him fully admit that he had gone mad, his heart throbbed with a stifling pain. He said softly, “Binghe, first leave that sword. Stand a little further away from it.” As he coaxed Luo Binghe with gentle words, he secretly placed his hand on the Xiu Ya sword’s hilt underneath the cover of his wide sleeve. Luo Binghe laughed. “It’s useless. Shizun, you don’t need to be like this. The nicer you are to me, the more afraid I am.” As he spoke, he made a very slight lifting gesture with his right hand. Instantly, the purple energy around the Xin Mo sword surged greatly. Zhuzhi- Lang spat out a mouthful of blood. That punch just then had only silenced him for a while, and he said calmly, “Pitiful.” “Pitiful?” Luo Binghe murmured, “Correct, I’m pitiful. Even if Shizun is only pitying me, that’s fine. Shizun, can’t you stay by my side just once?” Tears rolled down his cheeks. Luo Binghe gritted his teeth, his eyes scarlet. “Shizun, you always let go of me time and time again. “Every time, every time, anyone, anything! They can all become your reason for abandoning me, and sometimes you don’t even need a reason! It’s like this every single time!” Suddenly, Shang Qinghua fell onto the floor with a crash. Shen Qingqiu also subconsciously steadied himself against the stone wall. The entire floor started to shake violently. The speed at which Maigu Ridge was falling increased even more! Yue Qingyuan said quietly, “Shidi, he’s gone mad. How do you wish to handle this?” Luo Binghe chuckled coldly before he took two steps back and suddenly seized the hilt of the Xin Mo sword. The ground started to quake even more intensely, and if you looked out from the cave entrance, you could see countless mountain peaks of varying heights peek through from the rolling clouds. Shen Qingqiu was about to draw Xiu Ya when there was suddenly a burst of dazzling white light from beside him. Yue Qingyuan had pulled out his sword first, and the whistling of the sword tore through the air filled with flying snow and purple-black energy.Xuan Su left its scabbard! Mobei-Jun saw Yue Qingyuan level his sword at Luo Binghe, and he took a step forward to meet his attack. Xuan Su’s spiritual energy rose sharply, and before Mobei-Jun even touched it, it directly sent him flying out. It seemed like Mobei-Jun had never expected that he too would one day be sent flying by someone. With that kind of expression, he plummeted off of Maigu Ridge in the blink of an eye. Shang Qinghua looked scared out of his mind, and he grabbed a sword before he rushed past. Shen Qingqiu hastily grabbed him and said, “What are you doing!” Shang Qinghua howled, “Fuck, he can’t fly!” before he also jumped off. Shen Qingqiu peered down from the hole against the flying snow and violent wind. He just happened to see Shang Qinghua, who was riding the flying sword, catch Mobei-Jun when they were still about three hundred meters from the surface of the ice. After confirming that he wouldn’t crash and die, Shen Qingqiu didn’t even have time to release a sigh of relief before he suddenly looked back and saw that Luo Binghe and Yue Qingyuan had already started to fight. Naturally, Luo Binghe’s explosive energy was terrifying, but Shen Qingqiu hadn’t expected that after Xuan Su left its scabbard, its power would be as formidable as it was. It was on the same level as Luo Binghe in his crazed state. Shen Qingqiu could sense it, and the raging spiritual and demonic energy in the air created pressure and rumbling noises in his ears and throat. He saw that this cave would collapse sooner or later, and he scrambled over to the cliff wall before he grabbed onto the Xin Mo sword with his bare hands. With force, he pulled it out of the wall! Even though he had pulled it out, the Maigu Ridge’s falling momentum still didn’t slow. When Luo Binghe saw, he wanted to go snatch the sword away, but how would Yue Qingyuan give him that chance? The Xuan Su sword ripped a visible, dazzling mark in the air, and an enormous restrictive, complicated spell created an invisible cage, trapping Luo Binghe inside. Yue Qingyuan saw that Shen Qingqiu had already obtained Xin Mo, and he said in a low voice, “Leave!” How could he leave in this kind of situation? Shen Qingqiu immediately shook his head, and he was about to toss the Xin Mo sword to him when he suddenly felt his legs give out from under him. No, it wasn’t him, it was the floor that gave out. This cave finally collapsed!On the second layer of Maigu Ridge. Shen Qingqiu dug Yue Qingyuan out from the pile of rubble. “Sect Master? Shixiong? Zhangmen-shixiong!” Yue Qingyuan’s face was slightly pale, and blood trickled down from the corner of his mouth. He swallowed, and he seemed to have swallowed a mouthful of hot blood. He opened his eyes and glanced at Shen Qingqiu. “Where’s everybody else.” The structure inside Maigu Ridge was similar to that of an irregular wasp’s nest, one cave connected to another. Shen Qingqiu looked around him. “I didn’t see Great Master Wu Chen or Tianlang-Jun and the rest. They might be buried here, or they might have fallen into another cave as the rock collapsed.” He looked back. “Shixiong, when did you get hurt?” Yue Qingyuan didn’t answer. He asked, “You still have the Xin Mo sword?” Shen Qingqiu showed him the sword. “I do. But Maigu Ridge is still falling, so the merging shouldn’t have ended yet. Shixiong, you should take the sword down, and destroy it.” With his assistance, Yue Qingyuan slowly stood up. “What about you then?” Of course, he had to go back and find Luo Binghe. Shen Qingqiu avoided answering. “Shixiong, your injury isn’t typical. What in the world happened?” Yue Qingyuan dodged the question, and he said, “I didn’t want to at first. But I… am an easily impulsive person in the end.” Shen Qingqiu felt like those words of his were strange, but he didn’t have time to think about it carefully. He supported him and continued to walk. “Shixiong, can you still walk? Go down first, destroy the sword, and find Mu- shidi to treat your wounds. Leave Luo Binghe to me.” Yue Qingyuan stood up with difficulty with Shen Qingqiu’s aid. Fresh blood dripped onto the ground. Shen Qingqiu thought that he was fine, and he let him go, but unexpectedly, the moment he let go, Yue Qingyuan toppled over after standing for a short while. Shen Qingqiu went pale with fright. He hastily went to support him again. “Zhangmen-shixiong? Zhangmen-shixiong?” After feeling his pulse for a moment, even someone like him ━ with a very shallow understanding of healing ━ could tell that Yue Qingyuan’s current state was extremely terrible!Yue Qingyuan looked distracted, as if he hadn’t heard what Shen Qingqiu said. He muttered, “But… those two times at Jinlan City and when Luo Binghe encircled the peak, I controlled myself and took in the big picture… but every time I thought back to it after it was over, I would have been better off… just being impulsive.” Seeing his drowsy appearance, Shen Qingqiu wished he could violently pinch Yue Qingyuan’s philtrum 312 and pinch him awake. But at the same time, he didn’t dare to do something so impolite, so he could only speak loudly next to Yue Qingyuan’s ear, not letting him pass out. “Shixiong, wake up! What you did was right!” Yue Qingyuan closed his eyes and shook his head. He drew in a breath before he released another burst of severe coughing that made Shen Qingqiu’s heart leap with fear. Blood flowed unceasingly outwards with the coughs. He said with difficulty, “Help me… put Xuan Su back.” Shen Qingqiu hastily pressed the glaring white Xuan Su that had fallen to the side back into its scabbard before handing it to him. Only then did the color of Yue Qingyuan’s face finally look a little better, and he drew in the most difficult breath of air. He stared blankly at Shen Qingqiu’s hand that had put away Xuan Su. He didn’t take the sword; instead, he said, “If I die here, you… please help me take Xuan Su back to Wan Jian Peak.” Shen Qingqiu was given a shock. “What did you say?” Die? Was Yue Qingyuan’s injury severe to the point that it was very likely that he would die? Yue Qingyuan, “Xuan Su’s power is unusually strong, but I never draw it out to fight the enemy. You must have guessed the reason why.” Shen Qingqiu nodded. Not only had he guessed, but many people had also guessed before. Yue Qingyuan said, “Xuan Su is my life. Do you understand what that means?” Absolutely not. But Shen Qingqiu knew that it definitely wasn’t some rhetorical technique used to express how he loved his sword more than his life. He also knew that what Yue Qingyuan was about to say was certainly going to be a secret that he had never told anyone else before. Sure enough, Yue Qingyuan said, “Every time I draw Xuan Su, what is consumed is my life span.”The moment he said that Shen Qingqiu immediately felt as if the Xuan Su in his hand weighed a thousand times heavier. No wonder Xuan Su never left its scabbard. No wonder he would never draw his sword unless he absolutely had to. Shen Qingqiu said, shocked, “Shixiong, you… you’ve had a qi deviation before?” Using his life span as fuel for spiritual energy, tying his own life together with his sword. Unless he had experienced a major accident while cultivating and had a qi deviation, why else would Yue Qingyuan cultivate this kind of evil path? Yue Qingyuan said slowly, “I entered Qiong Ding Peak when I was fifteen years old. I had a goal to reach, and I was impatient for success. Pursuing the Way of Unity of Man and Sword 313 failed, and instead, I ended up like this. Completely the opposite of what I wished for, leaving behind great resentment and lifelong remorse.” As he spoke, the remaining bit of color that had risen to his face just then because of his coughing suddenly faded completely again. Shen Qingqiu quickly cut him off. “Don’t talk anymore. This isn’t the time to talk about it. Let me first send you down to find Mu-shidi.” The two of them took a few difficult steps forward. Yue Qingyuan abruptly said softly, “I’m sorry.” Shen Qingqiu didn’t understand what he was apologizing to him for. There wasn’t any reason for Yue Qingyuan to be sorry to him. On the contrary, it should be him apologizing, since he was always slacking off and taking it easy, not saying anything but still stirring up a bunch of trouble, forcing Yue Qingyuan to get a headache as he cleaned up behind him. But what Yue Qingyuan said next stunned him completely. Yue Qingyuan’s voice was shaking. “Really… I’m sorry. “Obviously it was so I could go back faster; obviously I wanted to immediately go back and get you… but instead, it ruined things. You weren’t wrong. After all, I’m a very impulsive person… “After that, Shizun abandoned my entire body and spiritual meridians, and I was shut in the spirit caves for over a year. Everything was a mess, and I had to start over completely. “I called out, I shouted, but it was useless. For an entire year, they let me go crazy however I wanted in the dark cavern. Nobody was willing to actually listen to what I was begging for; nobody was willing to let me out…“I used all my energy and effort, but by the time I returned, the Qiu residence had already been destroyed for many days…” The sound of something shattering came from somewhere deep within his mind. In an instant, all of Yue Qingyuan’s eager concern and silent protection in the past circled through his mind like a revolving lantern 314 , along with countless other scenes and details, incomparably clear. No wonder no matter how much trouble “Shen Qingqiu” caused, the Sect Master had never punished him for it. He had always shown him unlimited forgiveness and infinite patience. No wonder Shen Jiu hadn’t been able to wait for the person who was coming back to save him. Yue Qingyuan, Shen Qingqiu; Yue Qi, Shen Jiu. So that’s how it was! Yue Qingyuan said, “I really… didn’t purposefully not go back. The only thing was that it turned out that it’s true the world is very cruel, making you and I miss each other completely…” Blood flowed even more with each sentence he spoke. Shen Qingqiu took him by the arm, and they had to stop every other step. He sighed and said, “Don’t talk anymore.” He knew everything that came after that. But Yue Qingyuan persevered. “This time, just let me finish talking. “It was precisely as you always said. ‘I’m sorry’ is nothing but an empty phrase; it’s completely useless. I never explained either, so today, you have to hear it. It isn’t so I can beg for understanding. It isn’t so I can win sympathy, but rather, if I don’t say it now… I’m afraid it really will be too late.” Shen Qingqiu’s heart felt bitter, his eyes hot. Too late. It was already too late! Shen Jiu was already no longer here. Perhaps he was dead, or perhaps his soul had moved to a different unfamiliar world, just like Shen Yuan. But no matter what, he would never be able to hear what Yue Qingyuan was saying again. The System delivered a succession of announcements: Hidden Character ① Zhuzhi-Lang, 100% complete Hidden Character ② Tianlang-Jun, 100% complete Hidden Character ③ Su Xiyan, 100% completePlot Hole Filling Event ① Shen Qingqiu, 100% complete Plot Hole Filling Event ② Yue Qingyuan, 100% complete The completion percentage for characters has reached the minimum standard. As per the System’s testing, there are no evident holes in logic. B points +300 per task, with a total sum of 1200. Congratulations on being promoted due to “Many Vent-Worthy Points 315 .” You’ve earned the “Absurd Writing is Now Readable” achievement. Cool points have been cleared. Under the current circumstances, you may use B points as replacement currency for fulfilling the requirements for dropping key items. Will you accept or decline? There was a long series of beeps, full of joy. Instead, Shen Qingqiu felt unprecedented dismay. He said, “Is there any point?” Of course, the System wouldn’t answer him. Shen Qingqiu pointed two middle fingers at the interface from the depths of his heart. What kind of damn thing was this System? What was the point? Just so he could know exactly how unlucky these people could be? Just so he could personally witness the many brutal ways someone could get screwed over in this world? Or was it so he could drive Luo Binghe mad? Everyone said that Luo Binghe had already gone mad. Even Luo Binghe himself had laughed and admitted that he had gone mad. In the original work, after struggling for several million words, the Xin Mo sword that had been suppressed by Luo Binghe in the end actually gained the upper hand here, and it had corroded Luo Binghe’s rationality. This wasn’t caused by one or two factors, but more so a gradual accumulation of things, before it finally exploded completely. There had been many signs before this, but Shen Qingqiu had never noticed. Or rather, he had never known that Luo Binghe actually felt so insecure beneath the surface to the point that he felt inferior. First, he thought of Luo Binghe as too evil, but after that, he had thought of Luo Binghe as too bright and strong. When he looked back, there were initially signs of the Xin Mo sword beginning to corrode Luo Binghe’s rationality all the way back from Zhao Hua Temple. Luo Binghe, who had just heard his own background, received a great shock. It was the moment when he was the most frightened, and he had reached out towards Shen Qingqiu, begging Shen Qingqiu to leave with him.But he hadn’t taken Luo Binghe’s hand. Instead, he told Luo Binghe to leave by himself first. At that time, Luo Binghe’s mind started to become extremely unstable. What he needed wasn’t to withdraw safely, but to be with Shen Qingqiu. Even if he ended up being trapped at Zhao Hua Temple, unable to escape; even if he was attacked by everyone at the scene, it was still better than telling him to leave by himself! For Luo Binghe, whose mind was in that sort of state, it was the same as “abandonment.” It was like a repetition of how Su Xiyan had taken the poison that was deadly to him back then. Just as Luo Binghe had said, he wasn’t forcing someone to pick a side. Because Luo Binghe firmly believed from deep in his bones that he knew the answer: in the end, there would be a day that Shen Qingqiu would abandon him. His entire mind was filled with a near paranoiac fear and anxiety towards things that hadn’t happened. How had he not gone completely crazy? Yue Qingyuan’s footsteps grew weaker and weaker, and he almost couldn’t even stand anymore. Shen Qingqiu had never seen this Sect Master be weakened to this degree. Yue Qingyuan had always been calm and powerful. Even though he didn’t talk much and wasn’t aggressive, he was gentle and kind, and also extremely dependable with no loss to his dignity. Now, not only was it difficult for him to even walk, he uncharacteristically had a lot to say. He most likely really did feel like he couldn’t hold on for much longer. Shen Qingqiu was basically dragging him forward. As he walked, he said, “Zhangmen-shixiong, bear it, you must not faint. Everything will be okay very soon.” Yue Qingyuan laughed bitterly. “During all these years, you’ve never mentioned the past. You’ve only ever called me Zhangmen-shixiong. Have you made up your mind never to say Qi-ge 316 again?” The muscles in the hand that Shen Qingqiu was gripping the sword with gradually tightened. Yue Qingyuan wanted to hear Shen Jiu 317 say Qi-ge. But, he wasn’t Shen Jiu! He polished the original Shen Qingqiu’s cold and hateful energy, and he refused resolutely. “I won’t.” He couldn’t raise a death flag! Judging from the TV shows and novels, those characters who had their final wishes fulfilled and finished saying their lastwords would always be satisfied and immediately keel over. Shen Qingqiu said harshly, “I didn’t hear anything you said just then. Bear it, until we get down!” Yue Qingyuan closed his eyes and sighed. “Xiao Jiu ah…” Don’t say it. He didn’t dare imagine just what kind of expression Yue Qingyuan wore in the original work after Luo Binghe cut off “Shen Qingqiu’s” legs and sent them to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect in a gilded box. Even though he clearly knew that it was a futile effort, he still stepped into Luo Binghe’s trap honorably without looking back, up until ten thousand arrows pierced his body. The loyalty of a lifetime unexpectedly had to be repaid by so many things. Yue Qingyuan didn’t even have time to tell “Shen Qingqiu” ━ who was filled with resentment and had helped Luo Binghe lure him into the trap just to scrape for one more moment to live ━ the reason why he hadn’t been able to go back and rescue him that year. Why didn’t he say it sooner? Just like him and Luo Binghe, it was the same. Why didn’t he say it sooner? If he hadn’t guessed and assumed so much from the very start, Luo Binghe perhaps would have never blackened from beginning to end. He would’ve been that cute and bashful disciple for the rest of his life at Qing Jing Peak. Even if Shen Qingqiu took ten thousand steps back and had no choice back then but to push Luo Binghe down into the Endless Abyss, he completely could have achieved his goal using a different method. He wouldn’t even have had to waste any time thinking about it. Only now did Shen Qingqiu realize that, if he had wanted Luo Binghe to go down, he very likely would’ve only needed to say a single word and Luo Binghe would’ve obediently gone down. Shen Qingqiu had never once thought of this possibility. He didn’t believe that someone would be so stupid, that Luo Binghe would be so obedient. But in reality, he really was that stupid, that obedient. After many twists and turns, they took quite a few detours and went around in a big circle, and he looked around at a loss. He didn’t know where they were, and he could only feel regret and deep hurt, sighing ‘if only I had known sooner.’ But in this world, there was no such thing. After walking through this cave, two figures covered with dust suddenly appeared in front of them. The moment he saw those two round, shiny bald heads, Shen Qingqiublurted out, “Great Master Wu Chen. Great Master Wu Wang.” The short and small monk carrying the big and tall monk was precisely Great Master Wu Chen. He had lost one of his wooden fake legs, and it was hard to walk with one leg. Nor could he free his hands to clasp them together in prayer. Not willing to be impolite, he repeated a few more ‘Amitabha’s. “Amitabha, Peak Lord Shen, finally I found you. What happened to Sect Master Yue?” After Yue Qingyuan closed his eyes, he leaned against Shen Qingqiu’s body heavily. Shen Qingqiu said, “Zhangmen-shixiong… smashed his head against a rock. What about Great Master Wu Wang?” Wu Chen said, “He was injured by that Tianlang-Jun’s demonic energy and hasn’t awakened yet. The cavern collapsed, and those few from the demon race have all disappeared completely.” Shen Qingqiu drew Xiu Ya and handed it to him. “Great Master, may I please request of you to first take my shixiong and Great Master Wu Wang and leave Maigu Ridge on a flying sword?” Wu Chen, “What about Peak Lord Shen?” Shen Qingqiu said succinctly, “My disciple, I will take care of him.” Great Master Wu Chen said solemnly, “If Peak Lord Shen is willing to face him calmly, then that would be ideal.” Shen Qingqiu, “I’m ashamed. But I hope that I can resolve this matter before it creates irrevocable consequences. I will entrust Zhangmen-shixiong to Great Master then. If you can, please hand him over to Mu-shidi of Qian Cao Peak as fast as possible once you go down. I am extremely thankful.” Wu Chen put down Wu Wang and took Xiu Ya. He bowed properly before he said suddenly, “Xin Mo rose all because of an obsession.” Shen Qingqiu was startled. “Does Great Master want to say that if I wish to get rid of Xin Mo, I must break the obsession?” But Wu Chen shook his head. “If it can be broken, then that would not be an obsession.” “That’s also as I thought.” Shen Qingqiu returned the bow and turned. Who told him to be Luo Binghe’s obsession?"
"埋骨岭内部坍塌得一塌糊涂，原本里面上百成千个洞窟之间，四通八达 , 可现在几乎被巨 震震塌了一半，到处都被落石堵塞。 沈清秋在其中艰难地择道穿行。 忽然 , 一处巨大的拱石堆中，透出些许微弱的魔息。 沈清秋下意识喊： “ 洛冰河？ ” 别是被岳清源用大禁制封住的洛冰河给压了个正着吧？ 他跃了过去，抬起最上一层石板。露出来的是残损的青色鳞片。 伴随着青鳞微弱的起伏，大小石块滚滚落下。 竹枝郎的蛇形盘成一座小型堡垒，天琅君躺在中间，被护得滴水不漏。 他的躯体腐蚀的更严重了，随时头都能掉下来的样子 , 睁眼看了看沈清秋，招呼道： “ 沈峰 主。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 你们两位情况如何？ ” 天琅君道： “ 竹枝郎不太好。 ” 的确不太好。 以往明火灯笼一般亮堂堂的两颗硕大黄瞳已经开始涣散，但还算有神。蛇身青鳞脱落了不 少, 红一片黑一片 , 伤痕累累。 沈清秋帮忙把压在它尾巴上的石块推开，发现正阳还插在蛇身上。他一伸手，握住剑柄便 拔了出来。失血什么的对魔族倒没什么，倒是这灵力绝品的正阳剑插在它身上，伤害更严 重。 天琅君伸手捂住竹枝郎的伤口，道： “ 沈峰主不是不怎么爱理会他的吗？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 谁说我不理会他，只是有时候沟通困难。他 …… 怎么样。 ” 天琅君摸了摸那颗三角蛇头，没有回答，反问道： “ 接下来的局面，沈峰主打算怎么办？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 当然是毁剑。 ” 天琅君道： “ 心魔剑已经侵蚀入了洛冰河的神魂，与他同命，你现在要毁剑，不就等于杀 了他？ ” …… 沈清秋果断道： “ 那就再想别的办法。 ” 天琅君道： “ 即便来不及阻止两界合并？ ” 沈清秋吸了口气，烦躁地说： “…… 来不及就来不及吧！尽力而为，别的到时候再说。 ” 天琅君终于又笑了一下。 他说： “ 沈峰主，你这人真奇怪。用句你们的话说，道是无情却有情呢。对竹枝郎如此， 对我儿子更是如此。 ” 他叹了口气，感慨道： “ 果然还是没办法讨厌人啊。 ” 再怎么奇怪，也没您老人家奇怪啊。沈清秋跟他说不下去了，问： “ 洛冰河呢？你看见他 没？ ” 天琅君奇怪地道： “ 我以为沈峰主知道呢？不就一直在你身后吗？ ” 沈清秋猝然睁眼，毛骨悚然之下，慢慢地回头。 洛冰河果然站在他身后，正直勾勾盯着他的背影。 不知道他究竟是从什么时候开始站在那里的。或者说，是从什么时候就跟在沈清秋身后 的。 洛冰河微笑道： “ 师尊，把剑给我吧。 ” 沈清秋不动声色，把心魔剑举起： “ 你可以过来拿。 ” 洛冰河向他走了一步，忽然顿住了。他嘴角抽了抽，肩膀发起抖来。 沈清秋横剑在前，问道： “ 怎么了？ ” 洛冰河咬牙切齿道： “…… 滚开。 ” 沈清秋还没来得及回应，洛冰河一手按住太阳穴，甩出一记暴击，喝道： “ 通通滚开， 滚！！！ ” 这话不是对他说的，暴击也没甩到他身上，而是和沈清秋擦肩而过，打垮了一方本来就坑 坑洼洼的洞壁。 天琅君友情提醒道： “ 心魔剑的幻觉。 ” 不用他说，沈清秋也大概能猜出来。洛冰河现在的样子，明显是看到了旁人看不到的东西 ，手中灵力魔气乱轰，专门往他身旁打，和不存在的对手厮杀着。 山体又在振动，滚石簇簇坠落。沈清秋看了一旁两人一眼，喝道： “ 跟我来！ ” 洛冰河果然跟着他来了。 两人追逐间，前面那个脚底生风，后面那个游魂一般，却速度分毫不落。沈清秋有种自己 是肉骨头，勾着一只汪的感觉。 这时，系统提示道：【 “ 洛冰河 ” 怒气值 300. 乘以心魔剑系数 100 后，现状态 3000. 】 沈清秋咆哮： “ 我操关键道具呢？！快点死出来行不行！玉观音！玉佩！麻利点拿出来溜 溜！ ” 系统：【您好，关键道具掉落加载中。建议您暂时先使用其他工具。】 沈清秋： “ 还加载个屁  ！有什么工具翻出来看看！ ” 系统：【温馨提示：您上次购买升级的情景小推手豪华版尚未投入使用。】 沈清秋猛地刹步。 说实话，他到现在还没弄明白这个情景小推手究竟是个毛玩意儿、原理是什么。 但是，根据那仅有一次的用户体验来评价，它好像是  相当之有用！ 沈清秋咬牙道： “…… 来！ ” 让老子见识一下豪华版的霸气酸爽，来吧！ 他刚刚把 “ 确定 ” 狠狠戳下，地面便再次塌陷了。 下落的途中，沈清秋只有一个念头： 坑爹呢还小推手  你丫推土机吧！ 然而，滚了一阵，头部上方石影滚滚，他却并没被塌陷的山石砸中。 有人挡在了他身上。 洛冰河尽管神智不清，脑子稀里糊涂的，可在这种时候，仍是本能地用身体帮他挡住了乱 石。 他单臂反手一推，把砸在自己背上的巨石甩开，浑然不觉有何压力，低头呆呆和沈清秋对 视，眸子里似乎有刹那清明转瞬即逝，茫然眨眼，忽的又一片混混沌沌。 暗红的纹印顺着他的额头蔓延，爬遍了整张雪白的脸，还在往脖子下蔓延。 跌落一旁的心魔剑也仿佛和他身上的纹印呼应一般，明明暗暗，紫光黑气流转。 洛冰河嘟哝道： “ 师尊 …… ？ ” 沈清秋 “ 嗯 ” 了一声，见有鲜血顺着洛冰河额头往下流，嗓子有点发颤。 洛冰河道： “ 师尊，真的是你吗？ ” “…… 嗯。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 这次是真的？你刚才不是和他们走了吗？ ” 沈清秋说： “ 我不走。 ” 洛冰河慢慢俯 □ 体，把脸埋到他颈窝里，小声地说： “ 师尊，我疼。我头疼。 ” 这语气，又像是在撒娇，又像是真的疼。沈清秋慢慢伸出双臂，搂上他的肩背，轻柔地拍 了拍： “ 乖乖的。很快就不疼了。 ” 洛冰河道： “ 我乖乖的，就不疼了，师尊也不会再让我一个人了么？ ” 沈清秋说： “ 马上就不疼了。 ” 洛冰河低声道： “ 我不信。 ” 他突然暴躁起来，怒吼道： “ 我不信！我不相信！ ” 见他再次发作，沈清秋攀着他的肩膀，猛地抬头。 角度出了点问题，牙齿和牙齿碰撞到一起，撞得生疼。 嘴唇被堵住的洛冰河，眼睛还愣愣睁着。眨了一下，两下。 沈清秋也睁着眼，这样大眼瞪大眼，心里觉得诡异至极。互瞪了半晌，只好退了一步，自 己先闭上眼。睫毛一阵颤动，用力加深了这个吻。 老实说，这种撞得牙齿嘴巴现在还疼得发麻的，根本不能叫吻，只能叫啃。 但明显，洛冰河啃的很高兴，在沈清秋唇瓣上咬来咬去，呼吸越来越急促。突然把沈清秋 压了回去，按在地上。 嗤啦几声，沈清秋外衣被撕成数片。 其余的衣物，则被沈清秋自己脱了下来。撕撕扯扯间，下半身褪到膝盖，上身脱到只剩一 件中衣松松垮垮罩着，滑下了圆润的肩头。 【和谐】【和谐】【和谐】【和谐】【和谐】【和谐】【和谐】 沈清秋被他抱得呼吸困难，右手五指在地面岩石上抓出血痕，连一口气都被打断成好几次 才能喘完。 撑不住了。 真的快撑不住了。 就在他头昏眼花、眼前越来越黑的时候。一道微弱的白光划过。 叮的一声，落地声清脆。就坠落在沈清秋的赤【裸的肩旁。 洛冰河十分警觉，抬眼一看，刹那间，恍惚了一下。 然后，瞳孔猛地缩成一点。 先前模糊的景象慢慢重合，越来越清晰。 他缓缓低下头，脸色当场刷的惨白了。 沈清秋躺在他身下，衣衫尽数撕裂，双腿瑟瑟发抖，合都合不拢，眼眶红得厉害，快要气 绝的模样。 洛冰河不敢置信，伸手想去碰他，又不敢，僵在半空中，喃喃道： “…… 师 …… 尊？ ” 终于听到洛冰河正常地叫了一声师尊，沈清秋像是终于活过来一样，喘了口气。 这口气喘得太艰辛，听起来倒像是啜泣。 洛冰河怔怔地道： “ 师尊 …… 我 …… 我干了什么？ ” 沈清秋本想清清嗓子，说没干啥，干了你师父我而已。结果，嗓子没清成，咳出了一口 血。 两个人都懵了。 沈清秋的眼泪还没下来，洛冰河的泪水倒先下来了。 滴滴打在沈清秋脸颊上，顺着往下滑。 沈清秋以前最怕女人哭，现在最怕洛冰河哭，顾不得屁股痛，给他擦脸，哄孩子一样安抚 道： “ 不哭了哈。 ” 洛冰河的眼泪像断了线的珠子，顺着他肩膀滚落，一边手足无措抱着沈清秋，一边哽咽道 ：“ 师尊你别恨我 …… 我不知道 …… 我不想伤你的 …… 为什么你不推开我，为什么你不杀 了我。 ” 沈清秋在他背上有一下没一下地摸着顺毛： “ 为师知道。为师愿意。 ” 一边哄，一边心中无限凄凉。 被爆的人是他好不好！ 为什么爆人的那个哭的比他还厉害 …… 被日的还要反过来安慰日人的。 破处的洛冰河，简直比破处的小姑娘还难伺候！ 沈清秋无奈道： “…… 你先出来 ……” 洛冰河泪水还挂在眼睫毛上，小心翼翼地退了出来。他愣愣看着沈清秋双腿之间的一片惨 不忍睹，脸色越来越白。 尽管如此，还是细心地给沈清秋整好了中衣，把自己的外衫披到他身上。 沈清秋也不敢往自己 □ 看，慢吞吞地并上腿，过程中脸上肌肉一直在隐隐地抽。 他尽量让自己的表情看上去没什么痛感。 为了转移洛冰河的视线和注意力，沈清秋伸手去捡了一旁的玉观音，示意洛冰河低头。 他心里正怒艹系统一万遍。 麻痹的系统！！！贱人！！！ 早点掉落关键道具不行吗？！ 早点不行吗？！ 一定要日完了才掉落！ 日完了你掉有个屁用！ 有屁用！ 还是说不掉就日不完啊？！？！ 洛冰河结结巴巴道： “ 我以为 …… 我以为它早就丢了 …… 我以为再也找不到了 ……” 沈清秋给他把红绳戴上脖子，说： “ 今后收好。不要再丢了。 ” 洛冰河讷讷道： “ 那时候是师尊帮我解了围，难道从那以后，师尊一直，把它带在身旁？ ” 它一直都在系统空间内，说是一直带在身上，也不算说错对吧。 沈清秋有气无力点了一下头。 洛冰河抱着他的手缓缓收紧。泪水涟涟间，忽然看见手臂上的纹印，正在迅速消退。滚烫 的额头和脸颊也在迅速降温。 洛冰河愕然道： “ 你在干什么？ ” 沈清秋牢牢抱紧他，把洛冰河强硬地锁在臂弯之中，不让他乱动，沉声道： “ 不干什么。 我跟你说过的，很快就不疼了。乖一点，别乱动。 ” 洛冰河失声道： “…… 师尊你又要像上次那样，用自身引走心魔剑的魔气吗？ ” 沈清秋说： “ 跟上次不一样。 ” 洛冰河的拳头慢慢握紧，颤声道： “ 哪里不一样？师尊你为什么能这样对我？为了别人， 你居然能把同样的事情再做一遍！你是觉得，我还能再承受一次吗？ ” 沈清秋严厉地说： “ 洛冰河你听着！ ” 洛冰河果然含泪乖乖听着了。 沈清秋道： “ 上次这样，是为了逃避，这不假。 ” “ 可这一次，我这么做，不是为了别的任何什么人、什么事。 ” 他一字一句地说： “ 只是为了你。 ” 洛冰河道： “…… 只是为了我？ ” 沈清秋点头： “ 所以，再别说什么没人要你、没人选你这种话了。 ” “ 你母亲是拼着死才生下了你，如果她不想把活路留给你，数九寒天，冰天雪地，你在洛 川上，根本等不到别人来救，早就冻死了。她怎么会不需要你。 ” 沈清秋轻声道： “…… 师尊也不会不要你。如今你总算该相信了吧。 ” 洛冰河惶然地说： “ 我知道了，我信了。师尊，你停下来。你先停下来。你的身体根本承 受不了这么多魔气！ ” 沈清秋摇头： “ 没办法停。 ” 洛冰河看着他，霍然起身： “ 我去毁了心魔剑。 ” 沈清秋拉住他： “ 是你说的，我的身体根本承受不了这么多魔气。可它已经引渡过一半 了。事到如今，再去毁剑，也没用了。 ” 洛冰河跪了下来。 他说： “ 不关师尊的事，是我又把事情搞砸了。都是我不好。 ” “ 若是早知道师尊心里也是有我的，若是早点清醒，就不会到这个地步 ……” 沈清秋心里叹了口气。 早就说了，世界上从来没有什么 “ 早知如此 ” 。 谁又比谁聪明呢。 他说： “ 谁让你是我徒弟，教不严师之过，有再多的不好，为师都没有让你一个人扛着的 道理。 ” 洛冰河抓着沈清秋的手放到脸上，忽然破泣为笑。 他道： “ 师尊，我们一起。 ” 沈清秋一愣： “ 一起？ ” 洛冰河柔声说： “ 师尊你是我的容器，我是心魔剑的容器。待会儿我去毁剑。师尊不喜欢 给别人添麻烦，咱们就不给人添麻烦。不合并了，什么都不管了。就在这埋骨岭，一起烟 消云散。你陪着我，我也陪着你。 ” …… 男主和反派刚啪完就共赴黄泉吗。 好吧。 妈蛋，这种奇葩结局，一定是千年不遇的神作，一定会载入种马小说的史册，名垂千古！ 沈清秋干笑了两声。 洛冰河的热度似乎传染给了他，头有点晕。 昏昏沉沉间，他快听不清洛冰河的说话声了。 恍惚间觉得，他似乎真的拿起了心魔剑。 就这样吧。 似乎也没什么不好。 但有一个声音，还能听得真切。 【恭喜，各项数值达标，贵方升级为 vip 用户。请问，是否启用高级功能 “ 自救 ” ？】","CHAPTER 80: KEY ITEM The interior of Maigu Ridge had caved in until it was all a mess. Originally, there were hundreds of thousands of interconnecting caves extending in all directions, but now, half of them had collapsed because of the quake. Every nook and cranny was blocked off by fallen rocks. Shen Qingqiu struggled to navigate his way through them. Suddenly, a faint demonic aura emanated from amongst a pile of giant, arching rocks. Shen Qingqiu subconsciously shouted, “Luo Binghe?” It could not be Luo Binghe ━ immobilized by Yue Qingyuan’s seal ━ crushed under it, could it? He leaped over and lifted the topmost layer of the stone slab to reveal damaged green scales underneath. Big and small stones rolled down with every feeble rise and fall of those green scales. Zhuzhi-Lang’s snake form was coiled into a small, impermeable and protective fortress around Tianlang-Jun, who lay unharmed in the middle. The disintegration of Tianlang-Jun’s body was even more severe now. His head looked as though it could drop off at any moment. He opened his eyes and looked at Shen Qingqiu, even being in the mood to greet him, “Peak Lord Shen.” Shen Qingqiu asked, “How are both of you doing?” Tianlang-Jun replied, “I’m used to this. Zhuzhi-Lang, not so good.” He was indeed not in a good state. The light in his two large yellow pupils, which used to shine brilliantly like a pair of lanterns, had begun to dim, although they still had spirit in them. Many of the green scales on his body had fallen off and there were patches of red and black over the body; he was covered all over in wounds. Shen Qingqiu helped to push away the piece of rock that was pinning down his tail and found Zheng Yang still stuck in its body. He reached his hands out, grasped the hilt of the sword and pulled it out. The damage caused by blood loss was nothing to the demons; on the contrary, Zheng Yang was brimming with spiritual energy and sticking it into its body had caused even more serious harm. Tianlang-Jun said, “Isn’t Peak Lord Shen not very fond of paying him any attention?” Shen Qingqiu said, “Who said I don’t give him attention? It’s just that there’s a communication breakdown sometimes. He… how is he?”Tianlang-Jun used the remnant of his ruined arm to “stroke” that triangular snake head. He didn’t answer, but countered with a question, “What do you intend to do next?” Shen Qingqiu replied, “Destroy the sword, of course.” Tianlang-Jun said, “Xin Mo has already consumed Luo Binghe’s mind and is now one with him. Isn’t destroying the sword now the same as killing him?” Shen Qingqiu resolutely said, “Then I’ll think of another way.” Tianlang-Jun asked, “Even if it’s too late to prevent the merging of both worlds?” Shen Qingqiu took a breath and said impatiently, “Then so be it! I’ll do my best. We will talk about the rest when the time comes.” At last, Tianlang-Jun laughed again. He said, “Peak Lord Shen, you’re really a strange one. To use the words of you humans, you profess to harbor no feelings and yet there is 318 . This is so true of your actions towards Zhuzhi-Lang, and even more so towards my son.” He gave a sigh again and lamented, “As expected, I still can’t hate humans.” Seriously, no matter how strange I am, you still win hands down when it comes to being strange. Shen Qingqiu could not continue with the conversation and instead asked, “Where is Luo Binghe? Have you seen him?” Tianlang-Jun curiously asked, “I thought Peak Lord Shen knew? Isn’t he always behind you?” Shen Qingqiu’s eyes immediately widened. With his hairs standing on end, he slowly turned his head around. Sure enough, Luo Binghe stood behind him, staring fixedly at his back. There was no knowing exactly when he had started standing there. Or to put it in another way, when he had begun to tag behind Shen Qingqiu. Luo Binghe smiled and said, “Shizun, hand me the sword.” Maintaining his composure, Shen Qingqiu lifted up Xin Mo sword and said, “You can come over and get it.” Luo Binghe took a step towards him and suddenly stopped dead in his tracks. The corners of his mouth twitched and his shoulders shook. Shen Qingqiu leveled the sword in front of him and asked, “What’s the matter?” Luo Binghe clenched his teeth and hissed, “Get lost.” Before Shen Qingqiu could react, Luo Binghe pressed down on his templewith one hand, threw out a violent punch with the other, and shouted, “All of you get lost! Don’t pester him. Scram!” This was not directed at him, and the blow did not land on him but brushed past Shen Qingqiu and destroyed a part of the cave wall which was already full of dents to begin with. Tianlang-Jun helpfully pointed out, “Xin Mo’s hallucinations”. Needless to say, Shen Qingqiu could more or less figure it out himself, too. Luo Binghe obviously looked like he saw something others were unable to see. He was striking out with the spiritual and demonic energy in his hands at the space beside him in a frenzied manner, locked in battle with opponents that never existed. The mountain shook again, and stones tumbled down in chunks. Shen Qingqiu glanced at the two men on the side; they could be perfectly described as the old and the weak, the sick and the disabled. He shouted, “Binghe, come here!” Luo Binghe had a vacant look on his face: nonetheless, he was still very obedient and went after him as expected. The one leading in front moved fast like the wind, whereas the one following behind was like a wandering soul, yet he maintained his speed and never once fell behind. Right at this moment, the system prompted: Luo Binghe’s Anger Points 300. Multiplying Xin Mo’s factor by 10, the current value is 3000. Shen Qingqiu yelled, “Where is the key item? Can’t you bring it out quickly? Jade Guanyin! Jade pendant! Take it out fast!” System: Hello, the release of the key item is currently loading. It is recommended that you use other tools for the time being. Shen Qingqiu, “Loading my ━ ! What other tools are there, show them to me!” System: Friendly Reminder: The Small Scenario Pusher Luxury Edition Package that you have purchased previously is still unused. Shen Qingqiu abruptly came to a halt. Truth be told, he still has yet to figure out what the heck this “Small Scenario Pusher” was and how it worked. But, judging from that one time user experience he had, it appeared to be ━ quite useful! Shen Qingqiu gnashed his teeth and said, “Proceed!” Show me what this Luxury Edition is made of. Bring it on! He had just jabbed on the confirm button when the ground gave way beneath him again.On the way down, Shen Qingqiu only had one thought: what a scam, so much for “pusher” ━ you damn bulldozer 319 ! He tumbled and slid for a spell, and above him, the rocks were coming down in torrents. Yet, not one piece of the falling rocks struck him. Someone was taking the blows for him. Luo Binghe was delirious, and his mind was in a fog, yet when it came to the crunch, he had still instinctively used his own body to shield him from the crumbling rocks. With a single backhand push, he flung off a boulder that had smashed into his back. He was oblivious of the pressure as he lowered his head to look blankly at Shen Qingqiu; there was a fleeting moment of clarity in his eyes, but with a blink, it was abruptly replaced with turmoil. The dark red symbol on his forehead was spreading out in a pattern along his entire snowy white face, even extending down towards his neck. Xin Mo, which had fallen to a side, was ceaselessly glowing and dimming purple amidst a black cloud of energy, as if pulsating in tandem with the markings on him. Luo Binghe muttered, “Shizun…?” Shen Qingqiu responded with an affirmative “mhm.” Seeing fresh blood flowing down Luo Binghe’s forehead, his voice quavered a little. Luo Binghe asked, “Shizun, is it really you?” “Mhm.” Luo Binghe said, “Is this for real this time? You left with them earlier, didn’t you? I saw you.” Shen Qingqiu replied, “I’m not leaving.” Luo Binghe slowly bent down, burrowed his face in the crevice of his neck, and whispered, “Shizun, I’m hurting. My head hurts.” This manner of speaking was like the whining of a pampered child, yet it also seemed like he was really, really hurting. Shen Qingqiu slowly reached out his arms and placed them around the back of his shoulders. Patting him gently, he coaxed him as if he was pacifying a child, “Be good. It won’t hurt anymore soon.” Luo Binghe asked, “If I am good, it will no longer hurt, and so Shizun will never leave me alone again?” Shen Qingqiu said, “The pain will go away very soon.” Luo Binghe said in a low voice, “I don’t believe it.” All of a sudden, he flew into a rage and bellowed, “I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it!”Seeing him act up again, Shen Qingqiu grasped his shoulders, bravely lifted his upper body and raised his head. Something was wrong with the angle. It hurt when their teeth knocked against each other. With his mouth blocked, Luo Binghe’s stunned eyes were still wide open. He blinked once, then a second time. Shen Qingqiu’s eyes were wide open too. Staring wide-eyed at each other like this gave him an extremely weird feeling. After staring at one another for a while, none of them closed their eyes. So he could only give in and closed his eyes first. His eyelashes quivered, and he deepened the kiss. Honestly speaking, this kind of collision, where his mouth and teeth were still hurting so much that they felt numb, simply cannot be called kissing; it can only be called gnawing. But obviously, Luo Binghe was very happy to gnaw all over Shen Qingqiu’s lips, like he was eating candy. His breathing became more and more urgent, and he suddenly pushed Shen Qingqiu back and pressed him to the ground. With a ripping sound, Shen Qingqiu’s outer garment was torn into pieces. The remaining pieces of clothing were stripped off by Shen Qingqiu himself. In between the act of tearing at it, his pants were pulled down to his knees, and his last remaining undershirt, that had been loosely covering his upper body, slipped off his smooth, rounded shoulders. Luo Binghe ran his hand along the collar and slipped his hand in, groping. He was burning hot all over, it was even worse than the time at the Holy Mausoleum. His hand kneaded hard on Shen Qingqiu’s skin. He was burning, hurting, flustered. Shen Qingqiu knew what was coming. He had already made up his mind and was ready. He consciously turned his body around, with his back facing Luo Binghe. Although he had no experience in this kind of thing, he had heard that it was easier to enter from the back if it was the first time. He thought that this posture was kind of disgraceful, but he did not dwell too much on it. He originally meant to make it more convenient for Luo Binghe to have his own way with him, but who knew that he would be brazenly flipped back again. Luo Binghe wedged himself in between his legs, staring intently at his face. They were only a few inches apart, their hot breaths intertwining. A burning hot object was propped up against the dry opening on his lowerbody; its diameter was somewhat terrifying, like an engorged ball of something. Because the front end was slightly moist, his tight opening was able to take a little of it in. Luo Binghe did not charge in immediately. He was in a daze, yet he still insisted on staring fixedly at Shen Qingqiu’s face; bit by bit, he rained small, gentle kisses on Shen Qingqiu’s cheeks. Shen Qingqiu was initially a bundle of nerves, but because of this unconscious act, he relaxed a little. He relaxed too early. Shen Qingqiu finally experienced what it felt like to be split apart alive from the middle. He went mad with pain, kicking his legs back in a retreat. Luo Binghe clamped down on his waist and dragged him back, chafing his back against the rough rocks and stinging his flesh. The flare of pain at this very instance made Shen Qingqiu’s mind go blank. He struggled violently like a dying fish out of water. But the more he struggled, the more emotionally unstable Luo Binghe became; his eyes red, his breathing in disarray, his thinking clouded… all he could think of was to hold on to Shen Qingqiu and plunge it in until the very end! The thickest part of the tip, which was connected to a long shaft, was already buried inside him, pressing down heavily on his internal organs. Shen Qingqiu held his hand against Luo Binghe’s chest, but his waist was being held down in place, his legs were pressed against his own chest, and his hips were raised so high that he could not stop his intestinal wall from being stretched open all the way. He choked back a scream, loosened up as much as he could, and spread his legs open, letting Luo Binghe shove it all into the deepest recess. With it buried deep, it was as if he was being penetrated by a scorching nail and pinned to a rock alive. Luo Binghe, looking like he had finally found some sense of security, grabbed Shen Qingqiu by the hair and pulled him up into a kiss. The pain on his scalp could be overlooked, but the change in position gave Shen Qingqiu the horrible illusion that his internal organs had been displaced; the opening in his rear end was writhing uncontrollably. Unaware of this, Luo Binghe did not show restraint. Feeling invigorated, he began to thrust in and out without mercy. His actions were fast and savage. After hundreds of thrusts withalternating speed and varying depth, Luo Binghe was finally able to repeatedly enter him unhindered. The sound of papapa, intermingled with a watery, squelching sound, rang incessantly in his ears. Shen Qingqiu’s eyes filled with tears. It hurts. Boy, it hurts. He trembled with pain, but he did not forget what he had to do at this juncture. Transferring his spiritual energy over, he guided the turbulent demonic energy inside Luo Binghe into his own body. This method was awfully stupid, but it was also extremely effective. The source of Xin Mo’s demonic energy was Luo Binghe; if he split up and transferred some of this energy over to him, then Maigu Ridge would naturally stop collapsing due to a lack of power. The flesh wall of his insides shuddered as it enclosed that object that was ramming in and out relentlessly; no man has ever explored this territory before, and the grinding caused the tender meat of the wall to burn hot and swell. At the start, the passage was difficult, but after the bursts of searing pain, the intestinal muscles gradually moistened, with blood and intestinal secretions smoothing the way for intercourse. In the darkness, the smell of blood pervaded the air. The sounds of agonizingly repressed panting and flesh pounding on flesh were all the more vivid. Luo Binghe was so into it as he stubbornly clung on to Shen Qingqiu and nudged his cheeks against Shen Qingqiu’s forehead. He was a picture of obedience and aggrievement, but the same could not be said for sight below, which could almost be described as brutal. Shen Qingqiu was embraced so tightly that he had difficulty breathing. The five fingers on his right hand drew blood as he dug them into the rocky ground. Even his breath hitched several times before he managed to gasp for breath. He could not take it anymore. He really could not take it anymore. Just as he felt light-headed and his vision grew dark, a faint white light flashed across. With a crisp, clear “ding” sound, it landed on Shen Qingqiu’s bare shoulders.Luo Binghe was wary and raised his eyes for a look; in that split second, he was momentarily in a trance. And then, his pupils shrank. The images which were previously blurred gradually superimposed over each other, becoming clearer and clearer. He slowly lowered his head, and the color drained from his face. Shen Qingqiu was lying under him. His clothes were all torn. His legs were trembling and would not close. His eyes were terribly red. He looked as if he was going to take his last breath any moment now. Luo Binghe reached out a hand to touch him but got cold feet and his hand froze in midair. He mumbled, “Shi… zun?” Finally hearing Luo Binghe addressing him as “Shizun” in his usual manner, Shen Qingqiu looked as if he had been revived and gasped for breath. Only, this gasp for breath was so laboriously taken that it sounded like a sob instead. Luo Binghe was stupefied. “Shizun… I… What did I do?” Shen Qingqiu originally wanted to clear his throat, lighten up the mood and say, you didn’t do anything except do your shizun, is all. In the end, he did not manage to clear his throat but coughed out a mouthful of blood instead. Both of them were frightened out of their wits by this mouthful of blood. Shen Qingqiu had not even shed a tear yet when Luo Binghe broke down. His tears dripped onto Shen Qingqiu’s cheeks and slid down along its contours. Shen Qingqiu used to be afraid of women crying, but now, the thing he feared most was Luo Binghe crying. Ignoring the pain in his rear end, he wiped Luo Binghe’s face and consoled him as if he was coaxing a child. “Don’t cry.” Luo Binghe’s tears rolled down his shoulders like beads tumbling off a broken string. He was at a loss as he hugged Shen Qingqiu and sobbed, “Shizun, don’t hate me… I don’t know… I didn’t want to hurt you… Why didn’t you push me away; why didn’t you kill me?” Shen Qingqiu patted his back sporadically. “This master knows. This master is willing.” As he coaxed him, he felt a boundless sense of desolation. The one whose cherry got burst was him, alright? Why was the one who popped his cherry crying even harder than him? Why did the one who got screwed still have to turn around to comfort the one who screwed him? Give him a break! A deflowered Luo Binghe was simply even harder to placate than a deflowered maiden! Shen Qingqiu resignedly said, “Then… you pull out first…”Luo Binghe’s tears were still hanging off his eyelashes. Disregarding his bashfulness or the fact that he was still not done with venting, he gingerly withdrew. He stared blankly at the tragic picture that was in between Shen Qingqiu’s legs, his face turning whiter and whiter. Even so, he still attentively straightened Shen Qingqiu’s undershirt and draped his own outer robe over his body. Shen Qingqiu did not dare to look down at his lower body too. Very slowly, he closed his legs. As he did so, the muscles on his face twitched slightly. He tried his best to hide the pain on his face. In order to divert Luo Binghe’s line of sight and attention, Shen Qingqiu extended a hand to pick up the Jade Guanyin at one side and gestured to Luo Binghe to lower his head. Luo Binghe stammered, “I thought… I thought it was long gone… I thought I would never ever find it again…” Shen Qingqiu helped him to put on the red string around his neck and told him, “Keep it safe from now on. Don’t lose it anymore.” Luo Binghe hesitantly asked, “At that time, it was Shizun who helped me out of a tight spot. Could it be, from that time onward, Shizun has… has always kept it by his side?” It had always been stored in the system inventory, to say that he had always kept it on him was not exactly wrong. With this reasoning, Shen Qingqiu feebly nodded his head. Luo Binghe’s hands tightened around him. As he wept, he suddenly noticed that the patterns on his arm were rapidly fading away. His forehead and cheeks, which were burning hot, were also cooling down rapidly. He asked in astonishment, “What are you doing?” Shen Qingqiu hugged him tightly, locking Luo Binghe in his arms so that he could not move. He murmured, “Nothing. I told you, it won’t hurt anymore soon. Be good, don’t move.” Luo Binghe’s voice cracked as he asked, “Shizun, are you going to use your own body to draw away Xin Mo’s demonic energy like the last time?” The “last time” he spoke of was referring to the time when Shen Qingqiu self-destructed. That had certainly cast a huge shadow over him. Shen Qingqiu replied, “It’s different from that other time.” Luo Binghe clenched his fists and said with his voice quivering, “How is it different? Shizun, why are you treating me this way? For others, you would even go so far as to do the same thing again! Do you think… I’d still be able to see ithappen again with my own eyes? I should have known a long time ago, that no one would choose me and would rather abandon me and leave…” Shen Qingqiu said sternly, “Luo Binghe, you listen here!” Sure enough, Luo Binghe compliantly listened with tears in his eyes. Shen Qingqiu said, “Su Xiyan risked her life to give birth to you. Luo Binghe ah Luo Binghe, think about it, being the kind of person Old Palace Master is, would he have given his disciple some mild medicine? “That would definitely have to be something that is fatal to demons. If she had really lost heart, accepted her fate and took the medicine, even if you don’t die, how would you have been able to grow up to be this big all safe and sound?” Luo Binghe’s shoulders trembled. Shen Qingqiu continued, enunciating each word, “If I were in her shoes, I would not hesitate to drink it regardless of how lethal it is. Then, after escaping from the water prison, I would absorb it all into my own body. Regardless of how agonizing and horrifying the process is, regardless of the price to be paid, regardless of whether it would be a painful death, I would never let this child suffer any harm. “This is how I see it. You can take it as just an interpretation because there is no one who can tell you what Su Xiyan was thinking before she breathed her last. But if she really saw you as a disgrace, she didn’t need to do anything more. She could have just lowered you into the Luo River, on the coldest days of the year, in a harsh and frozen landscape ━ how could you possibly survive? “Or perhaps, she wasn’t willing to give up her position at Huan Hua Palace as the head disciple ━ with all the glory and a promising future to be had ━ and continued to gulp down every new poison sent by Old Palace Master; there would be no need to flee and hide pathetically from the pursuit of Huan Hua Palace’s disciples; nor did she have to strip off her outer robe and wrap it around you after giving birth to you all on her own on a secluded boat; she also need not use the last of her strength and energy to put you in a wooden basin and push you away to safety… You don’t even need to wait for someone to save you at all since you would have already become a wandering soul who met his freezing end in Luo River. “Now that you are standing here, alive and well, how can you hang on to the words of others and believe that your mother was really so cold-blooded and cruel that she didn’t truly want you?” After saying his piece in one breath, Shen Qingqiu felt stifled and sensed the demonic energy flowing haphazardly in his limbs and bones. He used his remaining strength to grasp Luo Binghe by the wrist.“Channeling away Xin Mo’s malevolent energy wasn’t because of any other person, or anything else. It was all for you. “I… have no wish to see a Luo Binghe who has fallen into the clutches of Xin Mo, with his mind so twisted that he would be perpetually haunted by phantoms for the rest of his life. “What this master expects of you, is for you to be alive, sober, and strong.” He then continued in a whisper, “So, stop saying that nobody wants you, or that no one would ever choose you.” Luo Binghe knelt by his side. His eyelids could no longer take the weight of his tears any longer and fell freely, like a child who has suffered too much injustice. He was merely a child all along. He walked alone on this earth, ran around in the dark, and fallen countless times. He never asked for much, and yet he always never managed to grab hold of those few he desired. If he had known this, Shen Qingqiu thought, he would definitely… definitely… But as it had been said earlier, there was really never such a thing as “if I had known” in this world. All of a sudden, Luo Binghe let out a laugh. One of his hands grabbed hold of Shen Qingqiu’s hand and laid it on his face, while the other hand picked Xin Mo up from the ground. The blade of the sword, which was encircled with swirling purple light, let off a whine that sounded like a shrill scream. The sound of something shattering into pieces reverberated in their ears. “Shizun, I know why you are saying this much.” Luo Binghe peered at him and pulled up the corners of his mouth. “But, if Shizun, the only one in this world who holds this kind of hope for me, is gone, then… what’s the point of me being alive, sober, and strong?” The heat from Luo Binghe seemed to have spread to him. Shen Qingqiu felt a little dizzy. In a state of grogginess, he could hardly hear Luo Binghe’s voice anymore, let alone stop his suicidal act of destroying his sword. He vaguely thought, then so be it. “Dying together” also meant being “together.” It did not seem to be all that bad. But there was a voice that could still be heard clearly ━ Congratulations, you have achieved the targeted score for the variousattributes and your account has been upgraded to Junior VIP user.

沈清秋说： “ 那啥。这个自救功能，只能用一次？只能用在我自己身上？ ” 系统：【理解正确。】 沈清秋立刻考虑到一个很严重的问题。 他先把洛冰河身上的魔气引了大半过来，现在就算再毁掉心魔剑，应该也不会对洛冰河造 成什么影响。 原先以为自己多半死定了，那孩子就哭哭啼啼说要陪他一起死。现在使用了自救功能，他 可千万别傻里傻气跟着自杀了啊！ 沈清秋忙问： “ 洛冰河呢？他现在怎么样了？ ” 系统：【目前您的权限暂时无法咨询总能源相关问题。请问是否要查看历史成就？】 都vip 了为什么还不能咨询！ 沈清秋急得抓心挠肝，但系统的尿性他早 get 了。 不够就是不够，不给问就是不给问，再急也没用！ 系统：【请问是否要查看历史成就？】 …… 好吧，看来这玩意儿非看不可。沈清秋挥手： “ 看看看！快看！ ” 伴随着一阵喜气洋洋的 bgm ，系统缓缓拉开卷轴一样的成就列表： 【避开雷点数目达到

种马文历史上，有哪个读者像他一样，舍身填坑，硬生生把这本书的 b 格拉高到这个档 次、获得这么多项荣誉的？！ 虽然方向上可能出了点偏差，但至少，这才是真正的 “you you up,o bb” ！ 忽然，沈清秋注意到，荣誉列表左上角，有一个小小的粉红色符号 “♀” 。 他知道符号 ♂ 代表男， ♀ 代表女，觉得有点奇怪： “ 这个符号什么意思？ ” 系统：【表明列表中所取得的各项成绩均为女性向荣誉。】 沈清秋： “…… 你逗我呢吧。 ” 系统：【作品分类已修改。】 等一下！ 为什么会被分到女性向！！！ 怪不得这种奇葩又狗血的剧情为什么还能摘取这么多勋章，原来是被划到女性向分类 了！！！ 女性向为什么还有 “ 尚可一撸 ” 勋章，她们拿什么撸！！！ 难道这是从终点主站被发配去女频了吗？！ 不对。真相，应该更可怕！ 沈清秋猛然想起，自从系统升级后，界面都换了，怪不得有点眼熟。这个界面的风格和色 调，好像 …… 好像那个传说中的绿丁丁文学城啊？！ 从第一天重生开始起、一直憋到今天的一口陈年老血，终于被悉知真相的沈清秋，喷了出 来。 他向天伸出尔康手： “ 不要  ！ ” 房间里静默了两秒。 呼啦一下，黑压压的人头全围了上来。 宁婴婴、明帆、齐清萋、木清芳、一堆人挤在床边，七嘴八舌。沈清秋被吵得脑仁儿抽抽 的疼，什么都没听清，弯腰抱头。只听柳清歌道： “ 都走开！ ” 他一说话，其他人立刻闭了嘴。晚辈们吐了吐舌头，灰溜溜地退开。腾出的空位被柳清歌 填补上。他抱着手，站到床边，沈清秋好不容易看到个靠谱的，抓住就问： “ 洛冰河呢？ ” 柳清歌的脸一黑，说： “ 死了！ ” 沈清秋： “…… 死了？ ” 不可能吧？！ 他真傻乎乎地跟着殉情去了？！ 看柳清歌的样子，不像是开玩笑，柳清歌也从不开玩笑。沈清秋猛地一下子坐了起来，动 作势头太猛，突然从屁股传来一阵钝痛。 他的脸刹那扭曲，咕咚一声，又倒了下去 这反应太过夸张，柳清歌像是受了莫大的惊吓，蹬蹬蹬后退三步，别别扭扭，像是又想走 上来说话，又想拔腿逃走。齐清萋抓了他一把，尖叫道： “ 你看看你，你看看你！这干的 是什么事！都让你别吓他了，活活把人又吓晕过去了！ ” 沈清秋躺在床上，举手： “ 我没晕。我 ……” 只是屁股痛，一时没坐住 …… 宁婴婴过往最怕百战峰峰主，这回胆子倒大了，对柳清歌使脾气跺脚： “ 柳师叔，你怎么 能这样。就算你再不喜欢阿洛，可明知师尊刚醒，受不了刺激，你 …… 你还乱说，乱咒他 死。 ” 木清芳也满脸责备： “ 柳师兄，你这样，真是不好。一点都不好。 ” 柳清歌第一次成为众矢之的，他本来就不善言辞，干脆退回桌边，发作道： “ 我不说话 了！ ” 沈清秋一手按着太阳穴，一手按着腰： “ 谁来告诉我，到底他死没死！ ” 齐清萋道： “ 没死！那小子以为你不行了，差点跟着你一起去，后来木师弟说你没事，还 有气，他哪还舍得死。 ” 果然如此。 万幸没阴错阳差！ 沈清秋知道了柳清歌刚才是说的气话，可也被吓住了一两秒，老脸有点挂不住，批评道： “ 柳峰主别这样行不行。我是信任你才第一个问你的。你太让我失望了。 ” 柳清歌瞪他。沈清秋不怕他瞪，慢腾腾坐起来，挑了个不会把屁股压得太疼的姿势，问： “ 到底怎么回事。我怎么又回清静峰了。埋骨岭呢？洛冰河人呢？ ” 齐清萋道： “ 别担心埋骨岭了，早炸了。 ” 沈清秋重复道： “ 炸了？ ” 齐清萋说： “ 你和洛冰河不是在埋骨岭把心魔剑毁了吗？剑断的时候，整座山就炸了。 ” 明帆挤了个头到床边，道： “ 是啊是啊，师尊，大半座山砸到冰面上，砸出了好大一个洞 ，后来洛川上的冰就融化了。您和洛冰河都掉到洛川里，还是柳师叔把你们捞上来的。 ” 沈清秋正接着宁婴婴递上来的茶，准备喝，还好没喝，不然肯定就喷了。 “ 你们 ” ？ 沈清秋心虚地斜眼瞅柳清歌。 卧槽，没记错的话（这种事怎么可能记错），他当时刚跟洛冰河那啥完事啊！ 虽然后来洛冰河给他穿了衣服，但身上多少残留罪证，凭柳巨巨慧眼如炬，会看不出来什 么异常，那才是奇怪。 怪不得柳清歌一直用这么严厉的目光盯着他！ 伤风败俗啊！ 齐清萋絮絮叨叨： “ 一捞就接了两个，抱得跟尸僵似的，分都分不开，那么多人都看着呢 ，丢不丢人啊 ……” 众目睽睽之下抱着掉下埋骨岭！ 沈清秋悔恨万分。 千防万防，还是防不住春山恨有了新素材！ 可依洛冰河那个脑回路，居然没把他直接带走，而是肯乖乖送他回清静峰，这也太奇怪 了。沈清秋觉得不太寻常，追问： “ 那究竟洛冰河现在人在哪儿？ ” 还是宁婴婴乖巧孝顺，道： “ 师尊你睡了这么多天都不醒，他当然是去给您找灵药啦。 ” 找什么灵药啊。好不容易大难不死，满血复活，这小子不跪在床旁边等他醒，出去乱跑什 么。这种杂事，交给小弟做！ 宁婴婴小声嘀咕道： “ 还不是被各位师叔师伯赶下山去的 ……” 洛冰河得罪了苍穹山派太多人，被赶也正常，只是他现在居然懂得忍气吞声，乖乖被赶 了。也真可怜。 不过，没事，就好。 见众人神色如常，还这么能闹腾，沈清秋猜岳清源该是安然无恙，还是问道： “ 掌门师兄 怎样？ ” 齐清萋没好气道： “ 你还知道关心一下掌门师兄啊。没死。 ” 果然，埋骨岭中拔剑一搏，并没耗尽岳清源的寿元。看来，玄肃的秘密仍未被旁人知晓。 沈清秋正松了口气，忽然，外边漆黑的夜空中，炸开几朵金灿灿的烟花，仔细听，还有喧 嚣人声从穹顶峰飘来。他问道： “ 怎么回事？穹顶峰那边这么吵。 ” 木清芳笑道： “ 沈师兄你醒的太是时候了。刚好可以赶上庆典。 ” 啥庆典？沈清秋脸大地想，难道是庆贺他终于苏醒？！ 柳清歌像是猜出了他在想什么，道： “ 两界合并失败，加上苍穹山派四百年大典，一起庆 了。 ” 沈清秋决定先去穹顶峰见岳清源。 这次庆典，不止只有苍穹山派内部人士参加，不少在洛川参展的门派也应邀前来。沈清秋 看见了不少熟人。 无尘大师阿弥陀佛，笑容满面道： “ 沈峰主安然无恙，真是万幸。 ” 无妄横了沈清秋一眼，十分嫌弃地走到别处去了。 无尘大师道： “ 沈峰主不要和无妄师兄计较。自从老衲在金兰城没了这双腿，他就对魔族 十分痛恨，连带也对沈峰主 ……” 沈清秋摸了摸鼻子，无所谓道： “ 不碍事。 ” 被个老秃驴嫌弃，算不得什么！ 他想了想，问道： “ 听说，天琅君由贵寺收押了？ ” 无尘大师道： “ 算不得收押，老衲只想与他畅谈佛法，同时助他延缓露芝躯的衰败，待到 几年他稳定下来后，再随他去。那时他爱游历人界，还是爱回魔界，随心即可。老衲以为 ，他身上并没有什么戾气，即便是曾经有，也该消散了。 ” 无尘大师在金兰城双腿为撒种人所毁，撒种人又是天琅君派出的，他却能不计较这一桩， 沈清秋不由得心生敬佩。 而且，他并非乱慈悲。最后一别，沈清秋也觉得，天琅君，应该再没什么毁灭世界的中二 * 了。 中二病拥有能毁天灭地的力量，这句话绝对是真理！ 告别昭华寺的僧人们，穹顶殿旁，站的是天一观的道众。 那三名孪生的美貌道姑正温言软语缠着一人，竟然是轻纱遮面的柳溟烟。 现在看着洛冰河这些后宫们聚在一起争芳斗艳，沈清秋有种十分奇妙的感觉，和以前一样 热衷于围观，不过已经没办法抱着 yy 的心态来围观了。 他斜眼多瞧了两下。只听那三姐妹娇声道： “ 好姐姐，好大人，给题个字吧。 ” “ 好不容易见着著者了，就给留个念罢。 ” 她们手里拿着一摞花里胡哨的小册子，往柳溟烟手里塞，小册子看起来十分眼熟。沈清秋 暗暗纳闷，总觉得很值得在意，正想走近些看清封面上的三个大字究竟是什么，忽然一旁 有个人影鬼鬼祟祟闪过。 沈清秋两步跟到他身后，一把揪住那人，凉嗖嗖地说： “ 你还敢上穹顶峰，不怕齐清萋活 剐了你。 ” 被人抓住，尚清华差点吓跪，一听是沈清秋，长舒一口气，转身说： “ 干啥呀，好歹也帮 忙打架过的不是，别急着赶人嘛。 ” 沈清秋： “ 你刚刚是从穹顶殿出来的？ ” 尚清华： “ 不错，说出来别吓着你。我可能就要回来继续做安定峰的峰主了。 ” 沈清秋： “ 岳清源让你回来？ ” 尚清华： “ 我是浪子回头，迷途知返，也没干什么伤天害理的事，他为啥不让我回来？ ” 沈清秋放开他，悻悻然道： “ 掌门师兄就是人太好了。 ” 尚清华整整衣领： “ 哎，看到自己写的小说面目全非成了这个样子，真是 …… 说不出的 醉。 ” 虽然知道他是在生硬地转移话题，沈清秋却被这句话勾起过往种种回忆，由衷赞同道： “ 对。太醉了。胡天胡地折腾一通，真不知道到底是为啥。 ” 尚清华道： “ 话不能这么说嘛。可能你觉得是瞎折腾，屁用没有，不过，对冰哥而言，可 能整个世界存在的意义，就是你的瞎折腾。 ” …… 靠，向天打飞机菊苣能说出这种话？！ 沈清秋悚然： “ 擦。你不是原装货吧？ ” 尚清华严肃道： “ 你不要这样。我也是个有文学理想的年轻人，当然有自己的感慨。 ” 沈清秋冷笑： “ 你的文学理想呢？为什么我只看到了无下限的杀必死？ ” 再加上日更一万的手速，还有间歇性爆发两万的魄力。如果没有这些硬件，谁会看这本天 雷滚滚的小说！ 尚清华摊手道： “ 你以为我一开始就是写无下限掉节操内容的吗？我以前也是有写过纯文 学的，但本本扑街，只好开辟一条大众化的道路了。 ” 沈清秋打量他： “ 你看上去好像一点也不心塞。 ” 尚清华说： “ 我为什么要心塞。与其写个种马男主，塑造现在的冰哥这样性格复杂一点的 奇葩男主，更符合我的写作理念。 ” 沈清秋总结道： “ 所以，你的写作理念就是写基佬？ ” 尚清华： “ 你瞧不起基佬男主吗？纯文学家，艺术作品，都喜欢塑造基佬。你看， ” 他掰手指： “ 断背山，白先勇，霸王别姬，经典，名家，他们都喜欢写基佬。纯文学青睐 基佬你知道吗？！ ” 沈清秋呵呵： “ 写个基佬男主就是纯文学。你知道丁丁原创网吗？照你这么说，上面都是 纯文学了？ ” 尚清华摆手： “ 我不跟你沟通，你是个黑粉。 ” 沈清秋刚想说 “ 我只黑不粉！ ” ，忽然听见尚清华在唧唧哼哼。 什么 “ 人情暖，恩难承，唇儿相凑，愿使今夜过明朝，朝朝暮暮永不休 ” ，关键是那个调调 听着特别耳熟，耳熟的沈清秋手痒牙痒，指他道： “ 尚清华，你哼什么呢？ ” 尚清华继续哼哼： “ 不知今时复明日，正阳阳尽需几时，正阳冉冉，秋声簌簌，修雅鞘无 ，寒水喷薄，泣不成声惨相求，求而不得复又起 ……” 沈清秋不可置信： “ 我 □□ 再唱一句试试？ ” 尚清华说： “ 沈大大你怎么不听人说话，千万不要随便操人。冰哥要疯。我告诉你，这个 春山恨，现在是相当于十八摸的存在。你们俩个那就是传说级别的国民 homo 你懂么？你 堵我的嘴有什么用，堵不住天下悠悠众人之口 ……” 终于，沈清秋如愿以偿地把向天打飞机菊苣暴揍了一顿。 好贱。太贱了！！！ 这种挖坑不填还烂尾、角色崩到西伯利亚反而喜大普奔的作者，就应该被活活打死！ 揍完以后，他整理仪容，埋入穹顶殿。大殿中央，岳清源正背对着他站立。 沈清秋上前行礼道： “ 掌门师兄。 ” 岳清源蓦地转身，脸上微露欣喜之色： “ 小九 ……” 沈清秋道： “ 师兄，是清秋。 ” 纵使不能对岳清源说明真相，沈清秋还是希望尽量能以示区别。 尽管这样，可能有些残忍。 岳清源怔了一会儿，低头轻声说： “…… 是清秋。清秋师弟。 ” 沈清秋看向他腰间的玄肃，还没开口，岳清源便自发道： “ 师弟不必担心。之后再闭关数 月，应当暂时无恙。 ” 沈清秋道： “ 师兄，那你今后千万别再冲动拔剑了。修为可以提，境界可以再升，寿元却 是无法补回来的。 ” 岳清源露出一丝涩然的微笑，缓缓摇头道： “ 补不回来的，又岂止是寿元。 ” 迈出穹顶殿，沈清秋在沿路年轻弟子们的欢声笑语，还有头顶的簇簇烟花中慢慢走着。 离开之前，岳清源对他说： “ 但是，苍穹山派，永远是你可以回来的地方。 ” 他说得郑重认真，岳清源一向是如此，承诺的事必然做到。做不到的，就会用一切办法来 弥补。 要是他真的是沈九就好了。 要是原装货真的能听到这句话，就好了。 沈清秋越走越慢，忽然，像是感应到了什么，抬头放眼望去。恰好看见，洛冰河在人群中 奔走，满脸急惶，似乎在寻找着谁。 旁人见了他那张脸，什么表情都有。沈清秋叫道： “ 洛冰河！ ” 洛冰河也看见了他，瞬间移到眼前： “ 师尊，你为什么没在清静峰？你现在能走了吗？ ” 沈清秋道： “ 我才要问你，为什么不去清静峰等着，出去乱跑。 ” 洛冰河低头道： “ 苍穹山派所有人都不欢迎我。我只能时不时悄悄去陪你。刚才没在竹舍 看见师尊，还以为你又走了。或是被他们藏起来了。 ” 沈清秋听他有点委屈地辩解着，不由自主想起了尚清华刚才的话。 如果他不胡搅蛮缠一通，说不定真的洛冰河就一黑到底，成了原著和惩罚系统中那个手撕 人棍的暗黑青年。 虽然现在，长成了一个神经病的恋爱脑青年，似乎也没好到哪里去 …… 不过多少也有惹人 怜爱之处吧。 沈清秋叹道： “ 知道自己不受欢迎，那还把我送回苍穹山。 ” 洛冰河低声说： “ 我以为师尊醒来的时候，肯定会更想在苍穹山 ……” 沈清秋扇了他脑门一巴掌。 都事到如今了，这孩子怎么还这么自卑，这么死脑筋，这么想不开！ 他恨铁不成钢道： “ 为师当然是最想先看到你了！ ” 洛冰河啪的挨了这一巴掌，脸却激动的都红了。眼睛也开始水汪汪的，欲言又止的模样， 沈清秋正被他这种目光看得受不了，忽听四下呼喝与刀剑声四起。 杨一玄站在穹顶殿檐上，嚷道： “ 那魔头又来缠沈师伯啦！ ” 一呼百应，当下有人跟着嚷嚷： “ 打！都打过去！ ” “ 这厮居然还敢来！ ” “ 洛冰河你这魔族宵小！敢上苍穹山派一次，就有被打下来的觉悟！ ” 难怪洛冰河没一直守着等他醒，感情他在苍穹山派还人人喊打，这么受 “ 热烈欢迎 ” 呢！ 沈清秋无奈道： “ 看来你确实只能偷偷地来。 ” 洛冰河小声说： “ 我早说了我在这里不受欢迎。 ” 沈清秋摸了摸他的脑袋： “ 没事。我欢迎你。 ” 穹顶峰上一片喊打喊杀之声，真假半掺，跃跃欲试，都是一群唯恐天下不乱之徒。更多的 则是对洛冰河这个混世魔王睁一只眼闭一只眼的和平路人。沈清秋哭笑不得，道： “ 不如 你先带我走。 ” 洛冰河一时没反应过来： “ 走？ ” 沈清秋点头道： “ 想带我去哪里，都可以。 ” 洛冰河愣愣地看着他。 沈清秋继续说： “ 你不是说在这里不受欢迎吗？那就走。魔界，幻花宫，想去任何地方， 为师都陪你。 ” 他没压低声音，峰上除了苍穹山派的弟子，还挤满了受邀前来参加庆典的各派修士，五感 灵敏，哪有听不清的道理，不约而同装聋作哑，看烟花的看烟花，谈笑的笑得更大声。 他们如此配合，顾全苍穹山派的面子，柳清歌却不领情，从屋檐上跳了下来，几乎是气急 败坏地冲沈清秋叫道： “ 喂！ ” 齐清萋怒不可遏： “…… 老娘不管了！爱去哪儿去哪！让他们两个相互祸害去吧！ …… 溟 烟，走了！还看什么！ ” 沈清秋一回头，黑线了一下： “ 怎么又哭了！ ” 洛冰河忙去抹眼睛，声音发颤： “ 不哭了，再也不会哭了。 ” 沈清秋觉得自己像唐僧，历经九九八十一难，千辛万苦，终于降服了一个闹天闹地的徒弟 ，勉强修成正果。妈的，实在太不容易了，就让他哭哭吧，反正，洛冰河就这么个德性。 疯子也有，傻瓜也好，恋爱脑也好，神经病也罢。就这样了。 沈清秋牵住他的手，像牵孩子一样，问道： “ 这次一起走？ ” 洛冰河慢慢抬头，眼底仿佛闪烁着熠熠星河。 手掌心贴合，十指紧扣。 沈清秋在前大步流星，听到洛冰河在身后叫着自己。 他轻轻地喊： “ 师尊。 ” 其实，这声音从未改变过。 始终如一。","CHAPTER 81: THE STORY BEGINS Proud Immortal Demon Way was a YY stallion novel. The great author Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky had clearly defined it as such since the very start. Shen Qingqiu was widely-known to be a shameless straight man. He had also clearly defined himself as such from the moment he was born. So, when Shen Yuan first flipped open this remarkable, shockingly high- quality book called Proud Immortal Demon Way which had even exceeded his own standards for styleif someone had told him then that: ah, you’re going to do gay things with the male lead of this novel, and what’s more, you’re the one who’s going to lie down and present yourself to him to be done… he definitely would’ve taken all fifty thick, brick-like physical volumes of Proud Immortal Demon Way and showed the other person what it meant to have their brains dashed out. Now, he floated in the empty dimension that he had passed through when he first entered this world, as he listened to the System’s familiar Google Translate accent spread through the entire space, the same as ever. Hello. Because of your enthusiastic hard work and energetic cooperation, each value has already reached the necessary minimum standard for promotion. The System is very honored to inform you that you have already been promoted to junior VIP member. Here, you are especially reminded that VIP members may enable the advanced feature “Self-Saving.” Under the circumstances in which your life points fall to their lowest possible value, you may restore yourself to full health once. Resurrected with full health! This VIP treatment was really too damn kind. Shen Qingqiu said, “Um, about that. Can this Self-Saving feature only be used once? I can only use it on myself?” The System: Correct. Shen Qingqiu instantly thought of a very serious problem. He had first drawn over a majority of the demonic energy from Luo Binghe’s body. Even if he destroyed the Xin Mo sword now, it shouldn’t greatly affect Luo Binghe. But originally, he had thought that he was more or less screwed, so that child had sobbed and said that he would die together with him. If he used the Self-Saving feature now, Luo Binghe better not foolishly follow him and kill himself! Shen Qingqiu asked hastily, “What about Luo Binghe? How is he now?”The System: At the time being, you do not have the authority to inquire about issues related to the source of all energy. Do you wish to examine your past achievements? He was already a VIP, so why couldn’t he inquire about it! Shen Qingqiu was filled with anxiety, but if his authority wasn’t enough, then it wasn’t enough; if he couldn’t ask, then he couldn’t ask. No matter how anxious he was, it was useless. The System persisted: Do you wish to examine your past achievements? It seemed like he had no choice but to see them. Shen Qingqiu waved his hand. “Yes, yes, yes. Hurry up!” Along with a peal of jubilant BGM 320 , the System slowly unrolled a list of achievements like pulling open a scroll: The number of landmines avoided was above twenty, eliminating the “Landmines Raining Down Like Lightning” tag, earning the “Rather Many Tsukkomi Points” medal. The highest value your past B-points reached was over 5000, earning the “Absurd Writing is Now Readable” medal. There have been at least three extremely melodramatic outbursts, earning the “Torrent of Abuse” medal. The insignificant side plots that flooded the main plot have been removed, earning the “Unequalled Water God” tag. The Hidden Characters have been mended, and basic Plot Hole-Filling has been completed, eliminating the “Big Plot Holes Everywhere” tag. The total value of cool points has surpassed the allowed maximum, earning the “Not a Bad Rub 321 ” medal. You have attained the System’s recommended standard. In summary: a love story about a chuunibyou who wants to destroy the world. When Shen Qingqiu saw that line: “…” There was no way to fight back at all waves bye-bye. If he thought about it carefully, it was indeed true that ever since he entered this story, Proud Immortal Demon Way unconsciously deviated from being an unscrupulous YY stallion novel into a pure love story filled with victories and losses centered around a crazy virgin entangled with melodrama. As Shen Qingqiu stared at that row of sparkling medals, he suddenly noticed that there was a tiny pink “♀” symbol on the upper left corner of the achievement list. He knew that the ♂ symbol represented male, while ♀ represented female,so he felt that it was a bit strange. “What does this symbol mean?” The System: It indicates that the various achievements acquired on the list are all honors with a female inclination. Shen Qingqiu: “You’re kidding me, right.” The System: The genre classification of Proud Immortal Demon Way has already been modified. Wait a second. Why was it now female-oriented! No wonder this kind of bizarre and melodramatic plot could actually earn so many medals! It turns out that it had already been reclassified as female- oriented, and was now being calculated according to standards for female- oriented works? Also, why did the female-oriented genre have a “Not a Bad Rub” medal. What did they have to rub! Could it be that the main final ending point was to be reclassified to become female-oriented? Shen Qingqiu, who had learned the truth, finally sprayed out that mouthful of old blood that he had choked back from the very first day he transmigrated all the way until now. As a result, a dense circle of heads surrounded him all at once. Ning Yingying, Ming Fan, Qi Qingqi, Mu Qingfang, and a bunch of other people were all crowded at his bedside, everybody talking over each other, saying things like “oh no Shizun vomited blood is Shizun going to die” and “he won’t, once the blood is out he’ll be fine.” Gloomy and cold stone walls that were slightly damp surrounded them, as well as two tiny candles. Shen Qingqiu managed to make out that this was a spirit cave before the echoes jolted through him, making his head throb with pain. He couldn’t hear anything clearly as he hunched over, clutching his head, only to hear Liu Qingge say, “Everyone move aside!” Once he spoke, everyone else immediately shut up. The younger generation stuck out their tongues before slipping back. The space they cleared out was filled by Liu Qingge, who stood with his arms crossed by the stone bed. Shen Qingqiu finally managed to find someone who was reliable, and he clutched onto him and asked, “Where’s Luo Binghe?” Liu Qingge’s face went dark, and he said, “He’s dead!” Shen Qingqiu: “Dead?” He really foolishly followed him and sacrificed himself in the name oflove? Judging from Liu Qingge’s appearance, he didn’t seem like he was joking, nor did Liu Qingge ever joke around. Shen Qingqiu suddenly sat up, but his movements were too forceful as a dull pain abruptly came from his lower half. His face immediately twisted, and he collapsed again with a thud. This reaction was too exaggerated. Liu Qingge seemed as if he had received a huge shock as he stumbled three steps back, fidgeting awkwardly. He looked like he wanted to go forward and say something, but also like he wanted to run away. Qi Qingqi grabbed him and shrieked, “Look at you, look at you! What are you doing! We already told you not to scare him, but you scared him so much that he fainted again!” Shen Qingqiu laid on the stone bed and raised his hand. “I didn’t faint. I…” There was just a certain part of him that hurt, and he wasn’t able to sit properly for the time being… In the past, Ning Yingying was the most afraid of Bai Zhan Peak’s Peak Lord, but now she had some guts, and she threw a fit at Liu Qingge, stamping her feet. “Liu-shishu, how can you be like this. No matter how much you dislike Ah-Luo, you know that Shizun just woke up and won’t be able to bear any shocks. Yet… yet you just say whatever you want, randomly cursing him to death.” Mu Qingfang also looked reproachful. “Liu-shixiong, this really isn’t any way to treat a sick person. It’s not good at all.” This was the first time Liu Qingge became the target of public criticism. He wasn’t good with words in the first place, so he simply went back to the side of the table and spat out, “I won’t say anything anymore!” Shen Qingqiu pressed a hand against his temples while he supported his waist with his other hand. “Who is going to tell me exactly whether he died or not.” Qi Qingqi said, “He didn’t! That brat thought that you were on the brink of death, so he almost went over with you. Later, Mu-shidi said that you were fine and still breathing, so how could he bear to die?” Thank the heavens a freak accident hadn’t occurred. Nobody would be able to withstand another freak accident. Shen Qingqiu knew that what Liu Qingge had said just then was out of anger, but he had also been given a fright for a few seconds, so his self-respect felt a bit damaged. He criticized, “Peak Lord Liu, can you not be like this? I asked you first because I trusted you. You really make me feel disappointed.”Liu Qingge glared at him. Shen Qingqiu wasn’t afraid of his glares, and he sat up sluggishly as he picked a position that wouldn’t press down too hard on his crucial parts and make them hurt. He asked, “What in the world happened? How am I back at Qing Jing Peak? What about Maigu Ridge? Where’s Luo Binghe?” Qi Qingqi said, “No need to worry about Maigu Ridge anymore, it exploded long ago.” Shen Qingqiu repeated, “Exploded?” Qi Qingqi: “Didn’t you and Luo Binghe destroy the Xin Mo sword in Maigu Ridge? When the sword broke, the entire mountain exploded.” Ming Fan squeezed in next to the bed. “Yeah, yeah, Shizun. Most of the mountain smashed onto the ice and created a really big hole. Later, the ice on Luochuan all melted. Both you and Luo Binghe fell into Luochuan, and it was Liu-shishu who fished both of you out.” Shen Qingqiu was in the middle of accepting the cup of tea Ning Yingying was giving him. He was about to drink it, but fortunately, he hadn’t yet or else he definitely would’ve spat it out. “Both of you”? Shen Qingqiu shot a glance guiltily at Liu Qingge. If he didn’t remember incorrectly (how could he remember this kind of thing incorrectly), he and Luo Binghe had just finished at that time, hadn’t they! Even though Luo Binghe had helped him dress afterward, there was still more or less proof of his sins left behind on his body. It would be strange if the great lord Liu couldn’t see anything abnormal with his all-seeing eyes. No wonder Liu Qingge kept staring at him with those severe “have to cleanse the sect” eyes. Public indecency brought shame to the sects! Qi Qingqi rambled, “He fished both of you up at once, and you two were hugging so tightly it was like you guys had rigor mortis, refusing to separate. So many people were watching too, isn’t that shameful, my great Cang Qiong Mountain…” That was for sure, with everyone watching. Shen Qingqiu felt extremely remorseful. Even with thousands and thousands of precautions, he still wasn’t able to prevent Resentment of Chunshan from gaining new source material. However, it was too strange that Luo Binghe had been willing to obediently send him back to Qing Jing Peak, and he actually hadn’t just directly taken Shen Qingqiu away, especially with the way Luo Binghe’s mind worked. Shen Qingqiu felt like it wasn’t quite normal, and he pursued the matter. “Thenjust where is Luo Binghe right now?” Ning Yingying was still the one who remained cute and obedient. “Shizun, you slept for so many days and didn’t wake. Of course, he went to go look for spiritual medicine for you.” Look for what spiritual medicine? He just barely managed to escape from the clutches of death and was resurrected at full health, so what was that brat doing running around wildly instead of kneeling at his bedside waiting for him to wake up? Leave that kind of chore for some little disciple to do! Ning Yingying muttered quietly, “If only he weren’t driven down the mountain by the rest of the masters…” Shen Qingqiu didn’t even feel like pretending to be aloof anymore. He couldn’t keep a poker face, and he ended up releasing a puff of laughter. Luo Binghe had offended too many people from the Cang Qiong Mountain sect, so it was normal that he would be driven away. It was only that now, he actually knew that he should swallow his anger and be obediently driven away. It was truly pitiful. However, as long as he was all right… then everything was fine. It’d be a wonder if he was all right. Shen Qingqiu’s expression suddenly changed. “Zhangmen-shixiong!” How could he forget that there was still Yue Qingyuan back there who had been on his last breath! He flipped and stood up at once, stuffing his feet into his boots before running outside. Nobody else expected for him to suddenly jump up, and they all stood there stunned for a bit before they chased after him. Mu Qingfang shouted, “Shen-shixiong, you should lie down a bit more” After he ran out of the spirit caves in one breath, the fragrant, crisp, and damp scent of the mountains flooded into his nose. Suddenly, several dazzling golden fireworks exploded in the pitch-black night sky outside. If he listened carefully, he could even make out the sounds of voices and a rowdy clamor floating over from Qiong Ding Palace. While Shen Qingqiu adjusted his boots, he asked, “What’s going on? Why is it so noisy over on Qiong Ding Peak? Where’s Zhangmen-shixiong?” Qi Qingqi tugged at her chest garment, which had become crooked, and she said irritably, “So you still remember to be concerned about Zhangmen- shixiong, hah. He didn’t die.” Mu Qingfang laughed. “Shen-shixiong, you truly woke up at the perfect time. You won’t miss the celebration.”When Shen Qingqiu heard that Yue Qingyuan was in good health, he let out a sigh of relief. It looked like drawing his sword at Maigu Ridge hadn’t actually used up all of Yue Qingyuan’s lifespan, or else Shen Qingqiu really wouldn’t know how to live with himself. He didn’t know whether other people had found out about Xuan Su’s secret either. As his thoughts changed direction, he began to wonder shamelessly: what celebration? Could it be that they were celebrating how he finally woke up? There was no need to go through such trouble and put on such a show, what an inconvenience. It seemed like Liu Qingge had guessed what he was thinking, and he unhesitatingly destroyed Shen Qingqiu’s ego. “They’re celebrating successfully preventing the two realms from merging. It’s got nothing to do with you.” Shen Qingqiu said, embarrassed, “Is it impossible to also celebrate a bit for me along the way?” Since it was a celebration held for an event of such universal rejoicing, naturally the people from Cang Qiong Mountain Sect were not the only ones attending. All the various sects that had participated in the battle at Luochuan had all been invited. There was a clamor of voices on Qiong Ding Peak, the crowds dense, and Shen Qingqiu also saw quite a few familiar faces. Those three beautiful Daoist nuns were currently pestering somebody with warm words and soft voices, and the person they were bothering was actually the cold and refined, full of righteousness Liu Mingyan, the gauze still covering her face. Now, Shen Qingqiu had an extremely strange feeling when he looked at Luo Binghe’s harem gathered together, vying for the spot of top beauty. He was just as passionate about observing them as before, but he could no longer observe them with the same YY attitude anymore. He peered at them from the corner of his eyes a few times, only to hear the three sisters say with delicate voices, “Dear big sister, dear mistress, dear senior, can you give me an autograph?” “We finally managed to find the author, so please let us have a keepsake.” “Is it really out of print? There won’t be any more copies?” They held a pile of garishly bright booklets, stuffing them towards Liu Mingyan. The booklets seemed extremely familiar, and Shen Qingqiu secretly felt puzzled, as if he should care about those booklets a lot. Just when he was about to walk over to see what exactly the three large characters written on the cover were, suddenly a figure furtively flashed to the side of him. Shen Qingqiu quickly caught up to him and grabbed onto the person. Hesaid coolly, “You still dare to come to Qiong Ding Peak? You’re not afraid of Qi Qingqi skinning you alive?” After being caught by someone, Shang Qinghua nearly kneeled on the spot then and there. When he heard that it was Shen Qingqiu, he let out a long sigh and turned. “Why, Cucumber Bro, for better or worse, you and I share a friendship since we’re from the same place and suffered similar circumstances from being beaten up. Don’t be in such a hurry to chase someone away.” Shen Qingqiu, “If you dare to come on Cang Qiong Mountain, then that means your whitewashing has already succeeded?” Shang Qinghua, “Correct. If I say how, I’m afraid I’ll scare Cucumber Bro. I’m probably going to come back and become An Ding Peak’s Peak Lord again. This is all thanks to Bing-ge’s 322 influence, may he live long and in peace.” Shen Qingqiu, “Yue Qingyuan let you come back?” Shang Qinghua, “This is called the return of the prodigal son who has mended his ways. It’s not like I did anything particularly outrageous, so why wouldn’t he let me come back?” Shen Qingqiu let him go. He said resentfully, “Zhangmen-shixiong is too nice.” Shang Qinghua fixed his collar. “Why else would he be so unlucky? Good people are taken advantage of.” Shen Qingqiu looked him up and down. “You don’t look crushed at all after all this foolish messing around ended up completely changing your own novel.” Shang Qinghua said, “You can’t say it like that ah. Maybe you think it’s just all foolish messing around that isn’t worth a damn, but for Bing-ge, your foolish messing around is probably the meaning of this entire world.” … holy shit, Great God Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky was able to say something like that? Shen Qingqiu was terrified. “Fuck. You didn’t turn back into the original character, did you?” Shang Qinghua said seriously, “Don’t be like that. I’m also a young person with literary ideals. Of course, I have my own reflections and emotions.” Shen Qingqiu laughed coldly. “What literary ideals? How come all I saw in the original work was shameless fan service?” Not to mention his hand speed that could produce ten thousand words a day, and the courage to even occasionally explode with twenty thousand. If he didn’t have such equipment,there was no way Proud Immortal Demon Way would have been able to hold out before it was serialized! Shang Qinghua spread his hands. “You think that I always wrote shameless content that lacked any integrity from the very start? I’ve also written belles-lettres 323 before, but they were all unpopular, so I had no choice but to go down a path that catered to the masses. It must be said that writing novels is a very lonely undertaking. Rather than writing a stallion male protagonist who’ll be stereotypical in the end, it’s more in line with my philosophy for writing to create the current Bing-ge ━ this kind of weirdo male protagonist whose character is a bit more complicated, has contradictions and conflicts, and has a rough destiny.” Shen Qingqiu concluded, “So, your philosophy for writing is to write about gay guys?” Shang Qinghua: “Do you look down upon gay male protagonists? Works of art and artists all like to create gay guys. Belles-lettres favors gays, do you know that?” He waved his arms wildly and passionately. “Cucumber Bro, if the System hadn’t chosen you, this faithful die-hard reader, perhaps the plot wouldn’t have deviated so thoroughly, thoroughly to the point that it deviated all the way back to my original scrapped outline. Even though the me back in reality ━ who couldn’t endure the loneliness and was under financial pressure ━ chose to finish writing Proud Immortal Demon Way according to other people’s preferences and what they found cool… now, all thanks to you, essentially everything that I wanted to write has already unfolded in front of my eyes. Cucumber Bro!” He patted Shen Qingqiu’s shoulders with deep sentiment and solemnity. “You… are the chosen one; as for my career, I have no more regrets!” … why did it sound like the System and this world were both products of Shang Qinghua’s resentment over scrapping that outline and going with what was mainstream? Shen Qingqiu, who shamefully became this kind of “chosen one”: “Who’s your faithful die-hard reader?” Shang Qinghua waved his hand and one-sidedly declared his victory. “I’m not going to talk to you; you’re an anti-fan.” Shen Qingqiu was about to say, “I’m only an anti, not a fan!” when he suddenly heard Shang Qinghua starting crooning something like, “The warmth of emotions makes gratitude hard to bear. Lips to lips, locked in a kiss. Let this night linger ‘til tomorrow’s dawn. Day after day, night after night; never to end.”The crucial point was that melody, which sounded extremely familiar to the point that it made Shen Qingqiu’s hands and teeth itch. He pointed at him and said, “Shang Qinghua, what are you singing?” Shang Qinghua continued to croon. “Will tomorrow be another today? When ‘til Zheng Yang reaches its zenith? As Zheng Yang ascends, the voice of Autumn stirs. A sheathless Xiu Ya, a spurt of cold nectar. Tragic pleas amidst choked sobs, thus in vain; for he rises again 324 …” Shen Qingqiu was in disbelief. “Fuck youwhy don’t you just try and sing another line?” Shang Qinghua said, “Great Lord Shen, why aren’t you listening to what I’m saying? You must never go around casually fucking people. Bing-ge will go crazy. I’m telling you, this Resentment of Chunshan is equivalent to Shi Ba Mo 325 . You two are the legendary national homos, do you understand? I have no problems with you shutting me up, but ultimately it’s useless. You can’t possibly make all the countless people in the world shut up…” Finally, Shen Qingqiu was able to fulfill his wish of violently beating up Great God Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky. How despicable. Too despicable! This kind of author who dug plot holes and left them unfinished; whose characters collapsed to Siberia yet still went viral 326 ; who even dragged in readers to help fill the plot holes with a “you can you up 327 ” attitudefully deserved to be totally beaten to death! Just when he was ready to drag Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky into the dark forest nearby and continue doing this and that, he suddenly heard a familiar “Amitabha” from behind him. Great Master Wu Chen said, “It’s truly a great blessing that Peak Lord Shen came out safe and sound.” Shen Qingqiu steadied himself and turned around, only to see the two abbots from Zhao Hua Temple walking slowly towards him, along with Yue Qingyuan. He relinquished Shang Qinghua and slightly rearranged his appearance. He smiled genuinely from his heart. “Zhangmen-shixiong, Great Master Wu Chen, Great Master Wu Wang.” Yue Qingyuan’s complexion didn’t look frail at all, and he also smiled back in return. Wu Wang leveled Shen Qingqiu with a look and walked away extremely pointedly. That expression was exactly like that of an old Daoist scholar whose head was full of old-fashioned ways of thinking and happened to see a woman who had taken the wrong path in life. It terrified him to the pointthat he gave a shudder. Great Master Wu Chen said, “Peak Lord Shen, don’t argue with Great Master Wu Wang. Ever since this old monk lost both legs at Jinlan City, Great Master Wu Wang has held extreme loathing for the demon race. In turn, also towards Peak Lord Shen…” Shen Qingqiu rubbed his nose and said indifferently, “No matter.” Being disliked by an old bald donkey didn’t mean much. Great Master Wu Chen said, “However, he’s gotten much better now. When Tianlang-Jun was kept at Zhao Hua Temple, Great Master Wu Wang never made things difficult for him.” Shen Qingqiu, “Tianlang-Jun was detained by Zhao Hua Temple?” Great Master Wu Chen, “It can’t be considered detainment. This old monk just wanted to have a long chat with him about dharma, while simultaneously helping him to slow down the deterioration of the Dew Seed body. After he stabilizes in a few years, then he may go free. When that time comes, he can do as he likes, whether that be continuing to travel the human realm or bringing Zhuzhi-Lang’s body back to the demon race. This old monk believes that he doesn’t actually have any evil tendencies; even if he did once upon a time, they should be gone now.” At Jinlan City, Great Master Wu Chen’s legs had been destroyed by sowers who were sent by Tianlang-Jun. Yet for him not to pick a bone over that, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but feel admiration. Moreover, he wasn’t carelessly merciful. At their last encounter, Shen Qingqiu had also felt that Tianlang-Jun probably wouldn’t have any desire to destroy the world ever again. That wasn’t what he really wanted or liked to do in the first place. It was just that without a slightly foolish Zhuzhi-Lang following behind him, helping him to settle accounts, fend off minions, collect strange little books there would be an unavoidable sadness every now and then. Just like the him right now. The monks from Zhao Hua Temple left first, heading for Qiong Ding Palace. Though Yue Qingyuan was the Sect Master, he didn’t go with them. Instead, he stood in his original spot, staring silently at Shen Qingqiu. For some unknown reason, Shen Qingqiu felt slightly awkward standing across from him. As if testing it out, Yue Qingyuan let out a, “Xiao Jiu…” Shen Qingqiu: “Shixiong, it’s Qingqiu.” Even though it was hard to explain the truth to Yue Qingyuan, ShenQingqiu still hoped that he could show him the difference as much as possible. Yue Qingyuan gave a start before he smiled weakly. “It’s Qingqiu. Qingqiu-shidi.” Shen Qingqiu glanced at Xuan Su, hanging from his waist. He hadn’t spoken yet before Yue Qingyuan spontaneously said, “Shidi, no need to worry. I will go into secluded cultivation after this again for several months, so I should be in good health for the time being.” Shen Qingqiu said, “Then Zhangmen-shixiong must not impulsively draw his sword from now on. Your cultivation can improve, your realm can still rise, but there is no way to recover your lifespan.” Yue Qingyuan shook his head slowly. “My lifespan is not the only thing that cannot be recovered.” Amidst the sound of young disciples cheering and laughing, the two of them walked unhurriedly towards Qiong Ding Palace under the clusters of fireworks overhead. Yue Qingyuan, “What do you plan to do after this?” Shen Qingqiu, “For now, I have no plans. When Luo Binghe returns, I suppose I’ll see what he wants to do.” Yue Qingyuan laughed. “You really do adore this disciple of yours very much.” Shen Qingqiu was just pondering over how he should answer when he suddenly heard Yue Qingyuan say, “Shidi. Cang Qiong Mountain will always be somewhere you can turn to and come back anytime you feel tired from wandering about outside.” He spoke extremely earnestly and seriously. Yue Qingyuan had always been like this: he would inevitably accomplish everything he promised. If he could not, he wouldn’t hesitate to make up for it no matter the cost. Ever since Shen Qingqiu entered the role of a character in the novel, he had always refused to become that scum villain from the original work. He had drawn a clear boundary and was proud of doing the complete opposite. There had never been a moment where he had as intense and impulsive a thought as he did now. If he really were Shen Jiu, then everything would be fine. If that person could really hear what Yue Qingyuan just said, then everything would be fine. Shen Qingqiu walked slower and slower until he suddenly lifted his headand looked as far as he could see as if he had sensed something. Separated by the crowd, Luo Binghe stood in front of him, underneath Qiong Ding Palace’s tall white stone platform. He stood all alone, acting as though nobody else was there. But when the pedestrians strolling around saw that face of his, they wore all sorts of different expressions. Shen Qingqiu subconsciously jogged a few steps forward before he looked back again and glanced at the person behind him. Yue Qingyuan said, “Go ahead.” He stood cheerfully and silently behind Shen Qingqiu. Just like the past, just like the future. One particular year, the insolent demon race came to Qiong Ding Peak to provoke and demonstrate their strength. There was quite a bit of smashing, fighting, and burning; they had also destroyed a pile of floor tiles while wielding a hammer. Luo Binghe was currently staring, head lowered, at the cracks between the white bricks on the ground when he suddenly heard the familiar sound of a fan unfolding. A pair of white boots stepped over the crack in the stone, through which a motley assortment of young vegetation had already sprouted. He raised his head abruptly. Shen Qingqiu shook his fan. “Don’t ask any questions. This master wants to first ask you: as a disciple, why were you not respectfully and quietly waiting for Shizun to awaken, instead of leaving to run wildly about?” Luo Binghe composed his excited expression with great difficulty, and he said, stifling his emotions, “Nobody welcomes me on Cang Qiong Mountain. I could only occasionally go and secretly take a peek. When I didn’t see Shizun just then in the spirit cave, I thought that Shizun had been hidden by them, or, Shizun left again…” As Shen Qingqiu listened to his slightly wronged explanation, he couldn’t help but remember what Shang Qinghua had just said. If Shen Qingqiu hadn’t meddled in everything, Luo Binghe most likely would have really blackened to the end, becoming the dark youth from the original work who tore people into human sticks with his bare hands and cursed the world and himself. Even though now he had grown up into a romantic young man, it didn’t seem to be much of an improvement… but, for better or worse, there were still aspects of him that made him lovable, right? At least Shen Qingqiu only discovered now that he himself truly quite liked this type.Shen Qingqiu sighed. “You know you’re unwelcome, yet you still obediently sent me back to Cang Qiong Mountain?” Luo Binghe, “I thought that Shizun would definitely want to see Cang Qiong Mountain more when you first woke up…” In spite of his image, Shen Qingqiu made an exception and smacked him on the forehead with his fan. He said resentfully, “Of course the one this master wants to see first the most is you!” Luo Binghe endured the smack, but he was so stirred up that his face grew red. His eyes also started to grow watery, looking like he wanted to say something but couldn’t. Shen Qingqiu almost couldn’t take it anymore, feeling weak from head to toe after being stared at by that kind of gaze, when he suddenly heard shouts and the sounds of swords rise around him. Yang Yixuan stood on the eaves of Qiong Ding Palace. He yelled, “Sure enough, that demon race rascal is back again to bother Master Shen!” Immediately, there were countless answers to his cry, as people instantly reproached, “He still dares to come! Ready your weapons, where’s my weapon?” “Shixiong, that’s my sword, give it back! If you want to fight, go back and get your own!” No wonder Luo Binghe hadn’t kept watch by his side, waiting for him to wake. It turned out that everyone was still clamoring to beat him up on Cang Qiong Mountain; what a “warm welcome.” Shen Qingqiu said helplessly, “Oh, not bad. Your judgment was correct. You really could only come in secret with these circumstances.” Luo Binghe said softly, “I said long ago that I was unwelcome here.” Shen Qingqiu rubbed the top of his head. “No worries. Shizun welcomes you.” Qiong Ding Peak was filled with shouts for fights and killing, interspersed with genuine and fake cries. The ones eager to give it a try were all a bunch of disciples who wished to see the world in chaos. The majority belonged to peaceful passersby who turned blind eyes to Luo Binghe, that world-destroying demon king. Shen Qingqiu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, and he said, “It would be better to leave.” Luo Binghe didn’t react for a short while. “Leave?” Shen Qingqiu nodded. “Didn’t you say that you weren’t welcome here? Then go, to somewhere that will welcome you.”He added, “This time, no matter where you want to go, this master will accompany you.” Because of that sentence, Luo Binghe’s face, which looked to be very intelligent, was taken over by a stupefied expression that was unbearable to watch. Shen Qingqiu hadn’t lowered his voice. Besides Cang Qiong Mountain Sect’s disciples, the peak was squeezed full of cultivators from all sects who had received invitations to come and enjoy the celebration. Their senses were keen, so they didn’t have any justification for not hearing it clearly, but they all simultaneously pretended they were deaf. Those watching the fireworks pointed at the sky, those conversing laughed so loudly that they almost shook the roof. Their cooperation was out of careful consideration for Cang Qiong Mountain’s reputation, but Liu Qingge didn’t appreciate it. He jumped down from the roof and shouted at Shen Qingqiu, nearly out of flustered exasperation, “Hey!” Qi Qingqi was in a rage. “This old woman doesn’t care anymore! Go wherever you want! Shen Qingqiu, you, you two… Mingyan, let’s go! Why are you watching? What is there to watch, have you never seen shamelessness?” “Shimei. Don’t create bad karma from your words. Your image ah…” The current Cang Qiong Mountain ━ besides shielding someone’s wrongdoings, carrying out forceful eviction, and being very familiar with the demon race ━ also housed a master and disciple pair who served as the leading roles for pornographic novels. Were there any other images that could leave such a deep impression on people’s hearts? Shen Qingqiu thought a bit and was actually rendered speechless. Like leading a child, Shen Qingqiu took Luo Binghe’s hand. He didn’t know when it had happened, but somehow it had changed into Luo Binghe leading him. He could feel the fingers covering the back of his hand gradually tightening, gripping more firmly. Forcefully, to the point that it felt painful. Luo Binghe lifted his head slowly, and the entire river of stars filling the sky glimmered and flickered in the depths of his pitch-black eyes. Shen Qingqiu was used to the sight, and he turned his head, his frame of mind now greatly changed like that of an old monk after a pilgrimage 328 . After experiencing countless hardships and suffering through trials and tribulations, he finally surrendered to an earth-shattering disciple, managing to obtain enlightenment with great difficulty. So, he might as well and just let himcry a bit. In any case, that was just how Luo Binghe was. To tell the truth, with such an unconstrained, tumultuous rollercoaster of a plot, Shen Qingqiu also wanted to let his old tears flow freely ah. As for the transformation of this unique, spectacular novel: it’s true that the Great God Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky had no regrets remaining for his career, nor could the unmatched troll Peerless Cucumber still say that he disliked it. If the author won’t fill plot holes, then this old man will do it himself. In all the long history of stallion novels, where could you find a reader like him, who took the lead and gave his own life to filling holes? Devoting so much just to rescue the B points for an incomparably absurd, brainless, beginner-level YY novel! Even though some deviations had probably occurred during the rescue, at… the very least… he… truly accomplished “you can you up, no can no BB”! The second he flipped open Proud Immortal Demon Way , the story officially began; the moment he closed Proud Immortal Demon Way , the story still remained unfinished. Or, in other words, the story that circulated among the people of the world has already come to an end. But, the story between you and me has only just begun. End"
